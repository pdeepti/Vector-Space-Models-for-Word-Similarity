program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 24.10.2009 german coalition deal draws praise and criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans of the parties to dominate the bundestag are loved by some , disliked by others the coalition deal between chancellor merkel 's conservatives and the business-friendly fdp based on major tax cut plans paves the way for a new center-right government .
but it 's sparked mixed reactions in germany . the agreement , finalized in the early hours of saturday morning , come three weeks of bargaining and almost a month after merkel 's conservatives and the fdp won a parliamentary majority in federal elections .
the new coalition will look to extend the lifespans of nuclear power plants it judges safe , change banking supervision rules to give the bundesbank greater powers and ensure continuity in foreign policy , according to the 128-page coalition agreement .
the centerpiece of the agreement is a plan to slash income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- , in particular reducing the tax burden on families with children and reforms to corporate and inheritance tax .
the plans have met with praise from industry leaders but germany 's political opposition and environmental groups have slammed them as unrealistic and damaging .
steinmeier : " false start " the leading opposition party social democrats has slammed the coalition deal as a shift in the wrong direction .
the social democrats were part of an uneasy " grand coalition " with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives for the last four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier warns of a widening gap between rich and poor outgoing foreign minister and head of the social democrats ' parliamentary group , frank-walter steinmeier described the deal as a " grand false start . "
steinmeier ran as merkel 's main challenger in the bid for the chancellery .
" nothing will get better , but there will be less security and things will get a lot more expensive .
this coalition will widen the social divisions in this country instead of fighting them , " steinmeier told newspaper bild am sonntag . the head of the social democrats , siegmar gabriel criticized the coalition for embarking on a course against the common good with an unrealistic financial plan . several economists too have expressed scepticism about how the new government would finance its tax plans in light of the country 's ballooning deficit as germany struggles with its most severe recession since world war ii . the left party accused the incoming government of failing to handle the costs of the economic crisis in a fair way .
party chief gregor gysi said berlin was about to embark on a path of " privatizing social risks , " with the majority shouldering the costs of the mistakes made by a few .
criticism over pro-nuclear policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shut down those nuclear power plants , says roth the opposition green party has accused the incoming government of endangering social peace in germany . " in terms of environment , transport , energy , and climate protections , the coalition agreement is a worst case scenario , " the greens ' chief claudia roth said on saturday .
environment groups have equally condemned the deal which abandons earlier plans for germany to scrap nuclear power by the year 2020 .
greenpeace described the coalition 's plans as a " clear failure when it comes to protecting the environment . "
allowing a longer life span to older nuclear plants is a " fatal sign " according to greenpeace .
berlin 's decision to back genetically modified crops has also sparked an outcry among environmentalists .
applause from industry and employers german business and industry however , have applauded the new deal as a step in the right direction to help germany fight its way out of the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundt , representing german employers , says the deal is a good compass the head of the confederation of german employers associations , dieter hundt , described it as a " good compass for the coming years , " criticizing only that the coalition did n't go far enough in making employment regulations more flexible .
hans-peter keil , president of the federation of german industries , said the deal was going into the right direction but expressed disappointment that there had n't been enough courage to push through further reforms .
especially research and innovation should have received more support , he said .
the german economy has been hard hit by the global economic crisis . the export driven economy received a massive stimulus package and several of the country 's banks could only survive with substantial bail-out money from the government . business confidence has picked up but analysts still expect unemployment to rise over the next year . ai / dpa / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the agreement came after the parties struck a compromise on thorny financial issues . the late-night agreement paves the way for a new center-right government to take office next week , nearly a month after merkel 's conservatives and the free democrats won a parliamentary majority in the september 27 federal election .
just hours after reaching consensus , the coalition partners announced plans to cut taxes from january 1 next year . " the burden on families has to be lessened , the burden on companies and inheritance tax has to be reformed , " chancellor merkel said during a press conference in berlin on saturday . " we are aiming for growth , " she said , adding that the new government would focus on education and social cohesion .
" we have agreed a coalition program showing that we want to advance courageously into the future . " at the joint news conference with merkel , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , described the coalition agreement as " a great compass for our country . " sharing key cabinet posts the parties divided up key cabinet posts , with current interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the cdu being chosen to head the finance ministry , while the fdp 's westerwelle is to become foreign minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has earned a reputation as a hardliner when it comes to security policy the 67-year-old schaeuble , who has been bound to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 and has the reputation of being a hardliner on domestic security policy , was a surprise choice for the post of finance minister .
ahead of the september election , he indirectly criticized merkel 's pledge to pursue billions of euros in tax cuts , saying there was little room for them given germany 's strained finances .
now schaeuble will be charged with implementing those cuts against the backdrop of a deficit that is poised to rise to double european union limits next year .
news of his likely appointment sparked mixed reactions in germany on friday .

but with no ministerial or foreign affairs experience , what does he bring to the table ? guido westerwelle , 47 , led the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to their best-ever result in the september 27 election , with the party taking just under 15 percent of the vote .
that ended an 11-year spell in opposition for the fdp and paved the way for it to become the junior coalition partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
it has also handed westerwelle a chance to move on from his role as leader of the opposition and on to greener pastures .
the roles of foreign minister and vice-chancellor are traditionally awarded to the leader of the junior party in federal coalition governments .
westerwelle assumes these positions from social democrat frank-walter steinmeier , who was also the spd 's chancellor candidate in the recent election .
political freshman but with only experience outside of government , and a political career that has barely , if ever , involved foreign relations , some are asking what westerwelle can bring to the position .
he has little direct experience of foreign policy but has recently made some visits abroad , including to russia .
his party is pro-american and westerwelle is not expected to deviate from the approach of his predecessors , nor from the " basic tenets " of post-war german foreign policy .
on saturday , oct .
24 , westerwelle said nuclear non-proliferation and the removal of us atomic warheads from german soil would be a priority for his ministry .
merkel has said this would be achieved through dialog with germany 's partners in the nato forum .
westerwelle is also known to be a supporter of stronger trans-atlantic ties , and is a member of the non-partisan atlantik bruecke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization , dedicated to achieving this goal .
but that wo n't necessarily mean that germany will give in to us wishes to commit more troops to afghanistan .
while westerwelle has been vague on many foreign-policy points , he has stated clearly his aversion to any expansion in german army operations under nato .
questions over effectiveness but westerwelle is bound to make waves for being europe 's first openly gay foreign minister , having publicly " come out " at merkel 's 50th birthday party .
the trained lawyer has dismissed any notion that this could pose problems in his role as foreign minister .
" some other countries may have had a problem with the fact that angela merkel became the first female chancellor of germany .
of course she does not wear a veil on the red carpet when she visits certain arab states , " he has been quoted as saying .
" the decision as to whom we send as a government representative rests solely with us germans , based on our political and moral standards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle introduced his partner michael mronz , right , some five years ago born in bad honnef , near bonn in western germany , westerwelle was elected to the german parliament in 1996 and became head of the fdp in 2001 .
westerwelle 's seeming reluctance to speak english has raised some questions about his suitability for the post of germany 's top diplomat .
westerwelle declined to answer a question in english that had been put to him by a bbc reporter during his first news conference after last month 's elections . " in great britain it is expected that people speak english , and it is the same in germany - people are expected to speak german , " westerwelle said at the time , prompting heated debate on the internet .
on the domestic front , the thorniest issue for westerwelle has been over tax cuts .
the free democrats had promised voters 35 billion euros worth of cuts in the recent election , but merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wanted only 15 billion euros .
on saturday , the coalition partners put this issue to bed , agreeing on 24 billion euros in cuts. dfm / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on friday , the staunch eurosceptic accepted a proposal by the swedish eu presidency to handle an opt-out from the treaty which he demands .
" this proposal corresponds to the president 's expectations and he can continue to work with it , " said klaus 's office .
critics of the czech president regard the demand as another attempt to delay the ratification .
however , friday 's statement by klaus 's office is the second glimmer of hope for the eu in a week , after the president suggested just days ago that he would ultimately sign .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , no matter how much some of us would want that , " he said last saturday , fueling hopes that the treaty might take effect soon .
exemption clause on property two weeks ago , klaus asked for an exemption from the treaty that would prevent ethnic germans forced out of his country after world war ii from reclaiming their property .
britain and poland won similar exemptions during the treaty negotiations in 2007 – catholic poland was assured it would not be forced to allow gay marriages , and britain promised that eu laws and courts would not prevail over its own judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso is unable to set up a new commission due to delays to the lisbon treaty stefan fule , czech minister for eu affairs , said the czech exemption would be a general one , comprising a comma and the words " czech republic " attached to " great britain " and " poland " in the treaty 's protocol .
recognizing that the chances that klaus might yield were slim , sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the czech cabinet set out to work on the wording of the exemption , which they hope to submit to the eu for approval at a summit next week .
european commission held up the eu has been waiting in suspense for klaus ' signature , the last step in the czech ratification process after local lawmakers approved the treaty earlier this year .
the impasse means that european commission chief jose manuel barroso , who was last month granted a second five-year term , is unable to nominate a new commission , because it is unclear what legal basis he should use .

this may take some time as klaus has also linked his signature to a go-ahead from the top czech court , which is currently assessing the treaty 's compliance with the country 's constitution following a complaint filed by a group of eurosceptic senators .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 24.10.2009 german parties reach coalition deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal came after marathon talks that stretched into the wee hours of saturday chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives are set to form a coalition government after sealing a deal with the free democrats .
the agreement came after the parties struck a compromise on thorny financial issues . the late-night agreement paves the way for a new center-right government to take office next week , nearly a month after merkel 's conservatives and the free democrats won a parliamentary majority in the september 27 federal election .
just hours after reaching consensus , the coalition partners announced plans to cut taxes from january 1 next year . " the burden on families has to be lessened , the burden on companies and inheritance tax has to be reformed , " chancellor merkel said during a press conference in berlin on saturday . " we are aiming for growth , " she said , adding that the new government would focus on education and social cohesion .
" we have agreed a coalition program showing that we want to advance courageously into the future . " at the joint news conference with merkel , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , described the coalition agreement as " a great compass for our country . " sharing key cabinet posts the parties divided up key cabinet posts , with current interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the cdu being chosen to head the finance ministry , while the fdp 's westerwelle is to become foreign minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has earned a reputation as a hardliner when it comes to security policy the 67-year-old schaeuble , who has been bound to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 and has the reputation of being a hardliner on domestic security policy , was a surprise choice for the post of finance minister .
ahead of the september election , he indirectly criticized merkel 's pledge to pursue billions of euros in tax cuts , saying there was little room for them given germany 's strained finances .
now schaeuble will be charged with implementing those cuts against the backdrop of a deficit that is poised to rise to double european union limits next year .
news of his likely appointment sparked mixed reactions in germany on friday .
“ he 's an unknown entity when it comes to financial issues , " dennis snower , head of the kiel-based institute for economic research , told the reuters news agency .
" you ca n't make any predictions about his future financial policy based on what he 's done so far . "
" i think he 's a tough cookie and this is what will be needed , " carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing financial markets said .
" he is someone who would not be afraid of ruining his public image due to unpopular decision-making . "
thomas de maiziere , merkel 's trusted lieutenant as chief of staff , is set to take over schaeble 's job at the interior ministry .
free democrats bag prominent posts as widely expected , the post of foreign minister goes to fdp leader guido westerwelle .
the 47-year-old is the first openly gay leader of a mainstream political party in germany .
he has no foreign policy or government experience .
rainer bruederle , the fdp 's economics spokesman in the parliament for a decade , is set to replace karl-theodor zu guttenberg as economy minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the asian-born free democrat is a surprise pick the media-savvy guttenberg is set to head the defense ministry .
the 37-year-old , who is a member of the csu party , will be in charge of tackling the afghanistan mission which is deeply unpopular in germany .
the free democrats ' phillip roesler is a surprise pick for the post of health minister .
the 36-year-old , a rising star in the fdp , is currently the economy minister in the state of lower saxony and is reported to have led coalition negotiations on healthcare .
born in vietnam , roesler will germany 's first asian-born cabinet minister , also replacing guttenberg as the youngest member of the cabinet .
compromise on tax cuts the deal over the new government came after the conservative bloc and the free democrats managed to reconcile their promise of billions of euros in tax cuts with a separate pledge to get germany 's deficit – swollen by massive stimulus packages – back under control .
horst seehofer , head of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , admitted the final round of negotiations had been bogged down by financial issues .
" the financial issues at the end are always the most difficult and most exciting and you have to do that with great care , " he said , explaining why the talks stretched into the night .
" but it all worked out in the end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer -lrb- r -rrb- admitted that the final round of coalition talks was tough to spur growth , the alliance plans to cut income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- between 2011 and 2013 , according to seehofer .
that is more than the 20 billion euros merkel wanted but far less than 35 billion euros the fdp sought .
" that number is right – even if you did n't hear it from me first , " seehofer said .
" i 'm very pleased with this result , " he added , referring to the coalition agreement after the protracted talks .
" we 've come up with a reasonable plan for the next four years and the coalition has set up a good platform for economic recovery in germany . " rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a poll conducted by yougov for the daily telegraph newspaper released on saturday shows that 22 percent of britons would " seriously consider " voting bnp in a future local , general or european election .
according to the website of the daily telegraph newspaper , this included four percent who said they would " definitely " consider voting for the party , three percent who would " probably " consider it , and 15 percent who said they were " possible " bnp voters .
two-thirds of those polled said they would not consider voting for the party " under any circumstances , " while the rest were undecided .
more than half of those surveyed agreed with the bnp or thought the party " had a point " in wishing to " speak up for the interests of the indigenous , white british people ... which successive governments have done far too little to protect . "
griffin , who was a guest on bbc 's " question time , " was asked about his views on the holocaust , immigration , islam and homosexuality by a panel and members of the audience .
he has accused the broadcaster of setting a lynch mob on him in a controversial edition of the show , which was watched by a record 8.2 million people – almost three times the average number of viewers .
he demanded that the bbc give him a " second chance " to get his views across , and insisted that " the british people are aghast at the display of bias from the bbc . "
recruitment flood the far-right , anti-immigration party claimed friday that 3,000 people registered to sign up as members after the show in what it described as its " single biggest recruitment night . "
in addition , the bbc said it had received more than 350 complaints from viewers following the screening , the bulk of which accused the broadcaster of bias against the bnp and its leader . among those watching was jean-marie le pen , the leader of france 's far-right national front party , who in 1984 saw his support double overnight after appearing on a high-profile tv political discussion show .
in an interview with london 's evening standard newspaper on friday , le pen suggested that the bnp would receive a boost from the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demonstrated outside bbc studios on the day of show " small fish will become big so long as god gives them life .
all political groups have started as marginal before becoming important , " he said . downing street said prime minister gordon brown did not watch question time but thanked justice secretary jack straw for appearing as the representative of the ruling labour party .
straw said the program had been " catastrophic " for griffin who had been " exposed as a fantasizing conspiracy theorist with some very unpleasant views and no moral compass . "
cabinet minister peter hain , a veteran anti-apartheid campaigner who fought unsuccessfully to try to stop griffin 's appearance , said : " this is exactly what i feared and warned about . " the bbc has handed the bnp the gift of the century on a plate and now we see the consequences , " he added .

the agreement came after the parties struck a compromise on thorny financial issues . the late-night agreement paves the way for a new center-right government to take office next week , nearly a month after merkel 's conservatives and the free democrats won a parliamentary majority in the september 27 federal election .
just hours after reaching consensus , the coalition partners announced plans to cut taxes from january 1 next year . " the burden on families has to be lessened , the burden on companies and inheritance tax has to be reformed , " chancellor merkel said during a press conference in berlin on saturday . " we are aiming for growth , " she said , adding that the new government would focus on education and social cohesion .
" we have agreed a coalition program showing that we want to advance courageously into the future . " at the joint news conference with merkel , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , described the coalition agreement as " a great compass for our country . " sharing key cabinet posts the parties divided up key cabinet posts , with current interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the cdu being chosen to head the finance ministry , while the fdp 's westerwelle is to become foreign minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has earned a reputation as a hardliner when it comes to security policy the 67-year-old schaeuble , who has been bound to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 and has the reputation of being a hardliner on domestic security policy , was a surprise choice for the post of finance minister .
ahead of the september election , he indirectly criticized merkel 's pledge to pursue billions of euros in tax cuts , saying there was little room for them given germany 's strained finances .
now schaeuble will be charged with implementing those cuts against the backdrop of a deficit that is poised to rise to double european union limits next year .
news of his likely appointment sparked mixed reactions in germany on friday .
“ he 's an unknown entity when it comes to financial issues , " dennis snower , head of the kiel-based institute for economic research , told the reuters news agency .
" you ca n't make any predictions about his future financial policy based on what he 's done so far . "
" i think he 's a tough cookie and this is what will be needed , " carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing financial markets said .
" he is someone who would not be afraid of ruining his public image due to unpopular decision-making . "
thomas de maiziere , merkel 's trusted lieutenant as chief of staff , is set to take over schaeble 's job at the interior ministry .
free democrats bag prominent posts as widely expected , the post of foreign minister goes to fdp leader guido westerwelle .
the 47-year-old is the first openly gay leader of a mainstream political party in germany .
he has no foreign policy or government experience .
rainer bruederle , the fdp 's economics spokesman in the parliament for a decade , is set to replace karl-theodor zu guttenberg as economy minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the asian-born free democrat is a surprise pick the media-savvy guttenberg is set to head the defense ministry .
the 37-year-old , who is a member of the csu party , will be in charge of tackling the afghanistan mission which is deeply unpopular in germany .
the free democrats ' phillip roesler is a surprise pick for the post of health minister .
the 36-year-old , a rising star in the fdp , is currently the economy minister in the state of lower saxony and is reported to have led coalition negotiations on healthcare .
born in vietnam , roesler will germany 's first asian-born cabinet minister , also replacing guttenberg as the youngest member of the cabinet .
compromise on tax cuts the deal over the new government came after the conservative bloc and the free democrats managed to reconcile their promise of billions of euros in tax cuts with a separate pledge to get germany 's deficit – swollen by massive stimulus packages – back under control .
horst seehofer , head of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , admitted the final round of negotiations had been bogged down by financial issues .
" the financial issues at the end are always the most difficult and most exciting and you have to do that with great care , " he said , explaining why the talks stretched into the night .
" but it all worked out in the end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer -lrb- r -rrb- admitted that the final round of coalition talks was tough to spur growth , the alliance plans to cut income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- between 2011 and 2013 , according to seehofer .
that is more than the 20 billion euros merkel wanted but far less than 35 billion euros the fdp sought .
" that number is right – even if you did n't hear it from me first , " seehofer said .
" i 'm very pleased with this result , " he added , referring to the coalition agreement after the protracted talks .
" we 've come up with a reasonable plan for the next four years and the coalition has set up a good platform for economic recovery in germany . " rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's sparked mixed reactions in germany . the agreement , finalized in the early hours of saturday morning , come three weeks of bargaining and almost a month after merkel 's conservatives and the fdp won a parliamentary majority in federal elections .
the new coalition will look to extend the lifespans of nuclear power plants it judges safe , change banking supervision rules to give the bundesbank greater powers and ensure continuity in foreign policy , according to the 128-page coalition agreement .
the centerpiece of the agreement is a plan to slash income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- , in particular reducing the tax burden on families with children and reforms to corporate and inheritance tax .
the plans have met with praise from industry leaders but germany 's political opposition and environmental groups have slammed them as unrealistic and damaging .
steinmeier : " false start " the leading opposition party social democrats has slammed the coalition deal as a shift in the wrong direction .
the social democrats were part of an uneasy " grand coalition " with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives for the last four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier warns of a widening gap between rich and poor outgoing foreign minister and head of the social democrats ' parliamentary group , frank-walter steinmeier described the deal as a " grand false start . "
steinmeier ran as merkel 's main challenger in the bid for the chancellery .
" nothing will get better , but there will be less security and things will get a lot more expensive .
this coalition will widen the social divisions in this country instead of fighting them , " steinmeier told newspaper bild am sonntag . the head of the social democrats , siegmar gabriel criticized the coalition for embarking on a course against the common good with an unrealistic financial plan . several economists too have expressed scepticism about how the new government would finance its tax plans in light of the country 's ballooning deficit as germany struggles with its most severe recession since world war ii . the left party accused the incoming government of failing to handle the costs of the economic crisis in a fair way .
party chief gregor gysi said berlin was about to embark on a path of " privatizing social risks , " with the majority shouldering the costs of the mistakes made by a few .
criticism over pro-nuclear policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shut down those nuclear power plants , says roth the opposition green party has accused the incoming government of endangering social peace in germany . " in terms of environment , transport , energy , and climate protections , the coalition agreement is a worst case scenario , " the greens ' chief claudia roth said on saturday .
environment groups have equally condemned the deal which abandons earlier plans for germany to scrap nuclear power by the year 2020 .
greenpeace described the coalition 's plans as a " clear failure when it comes to protecting the environment . "
allowing a longer life span to older nuclear plants is a " fatal sign " according to greenpeace .
berlin 's decision to back genetically modified crops has also sparked an outcry among environmentalists .
applause from industry and employers german business and industry however , have applauded the new deal as a step in the right direction to help germany fight its way out of the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundt , representing german employers , says the deal is a good compass the head of the confederation of german employers associations , dieter hundt , described it as a " good compass for the coming years , " criticizing only that the coalition did n't go far enough in making employment regulations more flexible .
hans-peter keil , president of the federation of german industries , said the deal was going into the right direction but expressed disappointment that there had n't been enough courage to push through further reforms .
especially research and innovation should have received more support , he said .
the german economy has been hard hit by the global economic crisis . the export driven economy received a massive stimulus package and several of the country 's banks could only survive with substantial bail-out money from the government . business confidence has picked up but analysts still expect unemployment to rise over the next year . ai / dpa / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 24.10.2009 czech nod raises new hope for eu treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorny obstacles have delayed the treaty and the creation of a new european commission the european union 's lisbon treaty looks set to emerge from a limbo as the last hurdle to its ratification , czech president vaclav klaus , accepted a concession offered by the 27-nation bloc . vaclav klaus is the last eu leader holding out on signing the treaty , which aims to streamline eu decision-making and must be ratified by all members to take effect .
on friday , the staunch eurosceptic accepted a proposal by the swedish eu presidency to handle an opt-out from the treaty which he demands .
" this proposal corresponds to the president 's expectations and he can continue to work with it , " said klaus 's office .
critics of the czech president regard the demand as another attempt to delay the ratification .
however , friday 's statement by klaus 's office is the second glimmer of hope for the eu in a week , after the president suggested just days ago that he would ultimately sign .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , no matter how much some of us would want that , " he said last saturday , fueling hopes that the treaty might take effect soon .
exemption clause on property two weeks ago , klaus asked for an exemption from the treaty that would prevent ethnic germans forced out of his country after world war ii from reclaiming their property .
britain and poland won similar exemptions during the treaty negotiations in 2007 – catholic poland was assured it would not be forced to allow gay marriages , and britain promised that eu laws and courts would not prevail over its own judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso is unable to set up a new commission due to delays to the lisbon treaty stefan fule , czech minister for eu affairs , said the czech exemption would be a general one , comprising a comma and the words " czech republic " attached to " great britain " and " poland " in the treaty 's protocol .
recognizing that the chances that klaus might yield were slim , sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the czech cabinet set out to work on the wording of the exemption , which they hope to submit to the eu for approval at a summit next week .
european commission held up the eu has been waiting in suspense for klaus ' signature , the last step in the czech ratification process after local lawmakers approved the treaty earlier this year .
the impasse means that european commission chief jose manuel barroso , who was last month granted a second five-year term , is unable to nominate a new commission , because it is unclear what legal basis he should use .
the mandate of the current commission – the eu 's executive arm – expires at the end of october .
the body that draws up legislation impacting the lives of about half a billion europeans and policing the application of eu laws is likely to remain a lame duck until the future becomes clearer .
this may take some time as klaus has also linked his signature to a go-ahead from the top czech court , which is currently assessing the treaty 's compliance with the country 's constitution following a complaint filed by a group of eurosceptic senators .
like president klaus , the senators fear the treaty will give too much power to brussels and threaten czech sovereignty .
the court has said it will discuss the complaint in a public hearing on tuesday , but it is unclear how long the process might take .
concerns over further hurdles the president of the european parliament , jerzy buzek , said on friday he expected the lisbon reform treaty to come into force before the end of the year while admitting that challenges persisted .
" it 's my personal opinion : i can say that it 's a very high probability that we will have our lisbon treaty in place at the end of this year , " he said in an interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus recently conceded that the lisbon treaty is inevitable however , buzek voiced concerns an opt-out deal with the czechs could " bring problems in other member states " .
" we would like to have a solution proper for the czech republic and for president klaus to sign the lisbon treaty .
but of course we would n't like to have problems in other member states , " he said .
concerns that more countries may try to negotiate footnotes to the charter intensified last week after slovak prime minister robert fico said he may ask for an opt-out clause for his country if the czechs succeed. rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 24.10.2009 jewish scholar challenged tradition with creation of unique library großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warburg examined the influence of the antiquity on later works a library established by hamburg-born jewish art historian aby m. warburg narrowly escaped destruction by the nazis to become one of the most significant book collections in europe to this day . he was " a jew by birth , a florentine in spirit , and a hamburger at heart . " that 's how art historian aby warburg saw himself in his own words . one of his most outstanding achievements was the founding of the warburg cultural studies library , which was officially opened in 1926 .
with four levels , the library was not exactly small , but it was designed in a space-saving manner .
narrow corridors and low doors awaited the visitors behind a red-brick facade .
the library 's infrastructure included the most modern technology of the time for transporting the books from one place to another , including special conveyor belts .
there were 26 telephone connections , a pneumatic tube , and an elevator for books and for staff .
a costly blank check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warburg was a great achiever , though plagued by mental instability warburg financed his library through his father 's banking firm , and later through that of his brother 's , who had moved to the united states .
" when aby was 13 years old , he offered me his firstborn rights , " said warburg 's brother , max .
" since he was the oldest , he was meant to go into the family business .
i was 12 at the time and agreed to buy his firstborn rights .
but he asked me to promise that i would always buy him all the books that he needed .
and , after short consideration , i agreed . "
in this way , warburg 's brother closed the deal - without realizing that this " exchange " involved writing out what was probably the most expensive blank check of his life .
behind the achievement of the library , there was a fragile human being .
with his poor health and bouts of depression , warburg from time to time underwent psychotherapy .
in 1918 , at the end of world war i , he suffered a mental breakdown - a culmination of his phobias , obsessions and delusions .
at the same time , however , he managed to gain widespread acclaim as an art historian , private scholar and researcher .
a non-traditional approach warburg was not interested in a purely aesthetic approach to art history .
his personal focus was the debate over the legacy of antiquity , which he approached with his portrayal of sandro botticelli 's works , the art of florentine painter , works by albrecht duerer and ancient pagan prophecies in written and visual representations .
" one day , i 'm sitting in the library 's lecture room with a newspaper from 1915 , " said rene drommert , a student librarian at the warburg house in the 1920s .
" suddenly , aby warburg appears and says , ' what are you doing there , mr drommert ? '
and i say : ' i 'm interested in the world war i era . '
warburg then bends over the desk and points to an advertisement offering flour and potatoes in exchange for a carpet .
and he says : ' naturally , you have the include things like this to get a good idea of the cultural and social life at the time . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for warburg , art was not just aesthetics , but the way people lived in warburg 's lifetime , the cultural studies library was considered to be an intellectual center in the weimar republic - and it remained that way till after his death on october 26 , 1929 .
many renowned scholars worked in the library 's reading room , including ernst cassirer , erwin panofsky and albert einstein .
according to charles hope , art historian and director of the warburg institute in london , what stands out is the prevalence of jewish scholars at the library .
" in my opinion , these people did not think that their jewishness had a large influence on their scholarliness , " said hope .
" their jewish background was of limited importance to them . "
second start in england this was until the rise of the nazi party threatened the library 's survival and forced it to move to london , which it did on december 12 , 1933 .
thanks to generous support on the british side , the library was preserved .
today , with 350,000 books , it is called the warburg institute and it is still one of the most significant humanities-oriented book collections in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cultural studies library is one of europe 's most important book collections the library gained its good reputation thanks to its unusual collection of books , as well as its interdisciplinary classification system , which links together very different subject areas : psychology and anthropology , theater , celebration and music , astrology and astronomy , chemistry and mathematics .
warburg himself had arranged the books in an interdisciplinary manner , and even the library 's architectural details reflected his educational motivations .
in the center was an oval reading and lecture room , because " warburg wanted an elliptical shape , as he believed that it helps people stay alert , whereas a circular room makes you sleepy , " according to hamburg art historian and warburg scholar martin warnke .
" also , it was because astronomer johannes kepler had proved that the earth and other planets followed an elliptical orbit , " said warnke .

" that 's how art historian aby warburg saw himself in his own words . one of his most outstanding achievements was the founding of the warburg cultural studies library , which was officially opened in 1926 .
with four levels , the library was not exactly small , but it was designed in a space-saving manner .
narrow corridors and low doors awaited the visitors behind a red-brick facade .
the library 's infrastructure included the most modern technology of the time for transporting the books from one place to another , including special conveyor belts .
there were 26 telephone connections , a pneumatic tube , and an elevator for books and for staff .
a costly blank check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warburg was a great achiever , though plagued by mental instability warburg financed his library through his father 's banking firm , and later through that of his brother 's , who had moved to the united states .
" when aby was 13 years old , he offered me his firstborn rights , " said warburg 's brother , max .
" since he was the oldest , he was meant to go into the family business .
i was 12 at the time and agreed to buy his firstborn rights .
but he asked me to promise that i would always buy him all the books that he needed .
and , after short consideration , i agreed . "
in this way , warburg 's brother closed the deal - without realizing that this " exchange " involved writing out what was probably the most expensive blank check of his life .
behind the achievement of the library , there was a fragile human being .
with his poor health and bouts of depression , warburg from time to time underwent psychotherapy .
in 1918 , at the end of world war i , he suffered a mental breakdown - a culmination of his phobias , obsessions and delusions .
at the same time , however , he managed to gain widespread acclaim as an art historian , private scholar and researcher .
a non-traditional approach warburg was not interested in a purely aesthetic approach to art history .
his personal focus was the debate over the legacy of antiquity , which he approached with his portrayal of sandro botticelli 's works , the art of florentine painter , works by albrecht duerer and ancient pagan prophecies in written and visual representations .
" one day , i 'm sitting in the library 's lecture room with a newspaper from 1915 , " said rene drommert , a student librarian at the warburg house in the 1920s .
" suddenly , aby warburg appears and says , ' what are you doing there , mr drommert ? '
and i say : ' i 'm interested in the world war i era . '
warburg then bends over the desk and points to an advertisement offering flour and potatoes in exchange for a carpet .
and he says : ' naturally , you have the include things like this to get a good idea of the cultural and social life at the time . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for warburg , art was not just aesthetics , but the way people lived in warburg 's lifetime , the cultural studies library was considered to be an intellectual center in the weimar republic - and it remained that way till after his death on october 26 , 1929 .
many renowned scholars worked in the library 's reading room , including ernst cassirer , erwin panofsky and albert einstein .
according to charles hope , art historian and director of the warburg institute in london , what stands out is the prevalence of jewish scholars at the library .
" in my opinion , these people did not think that their jewishness had a large influence on their scholarliness , " said hope .
" their jewish background was of limited importance to them . "
second start in england this was until the rise of the nazi party threatened the library 's survival and forced it to move to london , which it did on december 12 , 1933 .
thanks to generous support on the british side , the library was preserved .
today , with 350,000 books , it is called the warburg institute and it is still one of the most significant humanities-oriented book collections in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cultural studies library is one of europe 's most important book collections the library gained its good reputation thanks to its unusual collection of books , as well as its interdisciplinary classification system , which links together very different subject areas : psychology and anthropology , theater , celebration and music , astrology and astronomy , chemistry and mathematics .
warburg himself had arranged the books in an interdisciplinary manner , and even the library 's architectural details reflected his educational motivations .
in the center was an oval reading and lecture room , because " warburg wanted an elliptical shape , as he believed that it helps people stay alert , whereas a circular room makes you sleepy , " according to hamburg art historian and warburg scholar martin warnke .
" also , it was because astronomer johannes kepler had proved that the earth and other planets followed an elliptical orbit , " said warnke .

the reaction from all sides has been swift and not all of it is positive . a deal to reduce the period of compulsory military service in germany was worked out between chancellor angela merkel 's incoming government coalition of the conservative union parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
as of january 1 , 2011 , military service will be reduced from nine months to six .
in its election platform , the fdp had called for an abolishment of conscription , however chancellor merkel prefers to keep some form of military service .
as it now stands , young men are obliged to do a compulsory tour of duty in the german military .
they can opt out or refuse , but then must perform " civilian service , " such as working in a hospital , nursing home or other civil organization .
under the new proposal , military service will consist of three months of basic training , two months of specialized training and one month of duty in specialist service units .
the reactions to the deal have been swift and varied .
while werner hoyer , a member of the fdp , called it a reasonable compromise , johannes kahrs , a leader in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the proposal pure nonsense .
" for military service to have any value at all , it should take at least nine months , " said kahrs in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper .
spd defense expert rainer arnold said that lowering the time from nine months to six relegated military service to " an introductory course " instead of a full meal .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mutual distrust kept conscription alive one of the main reasons for conscription and maintaining an army in readiness in the past was the deep mistrust that existed between the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and west germany .
service in the military for all men over the age of 18 became compulsory in 1956 .
the option of doing civil service instead of military service was introduced in 1961 .
over the years , the amount of time one had to serve in the military has been reduced .
in the 1960s it was 18 months .
after january 2002 that number had fallen to nine months .
in the former gdr , compulsory military service was introduced in 1962 .
there are currently about 250,000 men in the german army .
of that amount , 68,270 are conscripts and of those , 25,270 are soldiers who volunteered to remain a few months longer after their mandatory service was up .
future possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association another concern of reducing military service is the concomitant effect on civil service positions that have been filled by men who chose not to serve in the military .
some have said this loss of manpower to civil organizations would be harmful .
but peter tobiassen , the head of an organization that represents conscientious objectors , has said that there are three times as many applicants for those positions than there are jobs available .
while the cdu and csu want to maintain some sort of military conscription in the future , the idea of an all-voluntary military continues to circulate .
in an interview in july , germany 's incoming foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said that while conscription had its merits , it was a thing of the past .
ulrich kirsch , the chairman of the federal armed forces association said that the german army was " open to " the idea of an all voluntary force , but more research was needed .
in any event , kirsch noted that changing to an all voluntary army would require amending the constitution , which would take a two-thirds majority , and that that was not going to happen in the near future. av / dpa / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the reaction from all sides has been swift and not all of it is positive . a deal to reduce the period of compulsory military service in germany was worked out between chancellor angela merkel 's incoming government coalition of the conservative union parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
as of january 1 , 2011 , military service will be reduced from nine months to six .
in its election platform , the fdp had called for an abolishment of conscription , however chancellor merkel prefers to keep some form of military service .
as it now stands , young men are obliged to do a compulsory tour of duty in the german military .
they can opt out or refuse , but then must perform " civilian service , " such as working in a hospital , nursing home or other civil organization .
under the new proposal , military service will consist of three months of basic training , two months of specialized training and one month of duty in specialist service units .
the reactions to the deal have been swift and varied .
while werner hoyer , a member of the fdp , called it a reasonable compromise , johannes kahrs , a leader in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the proposal pure nonsense .
" for military service to have any value at all , it should take at least nine months , " said kahrs in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper .
spd defense expert rainer arnold said that lowering the time from nine months to six relegated military service to " an introductory course " instead of a full meal .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mutual distrust kept conscription alive one of the main reasons for conscription and maintaining an army in readiness in the past was the deep mistrust that existed between the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and west germany .
service in the military for all men over the age of 18 became compulsory in 1956 .
the option of doing civil service instead of military service was introduced in 1961 .
over the years , the amount of time one had to serve in the military has been reduced .
in the 1960s it was 18 months .
after january 2002 that number had fallen to nine months .
in the former gdr , compulsory military service was introduced in 1962 .
there are currently about 250,000 men in the german army .
of that amount , 68,270 are conscripts and of those , 25,270 are soldiers who volunteered to remain a few months longer after their mandatory service was up .
future possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association another concern of reducing military service is the concomitant effect on civil service positions that have been filled by men who chose not to serve in the military .
some have said this loss of manpower to civil organizations would be harmful .
but peter tobiassen , the head of an organization that represents conscientious objectors , has said that there are three times as many applicants for those positions than there are jobs available .
while the cdu and csu want to maintain some sort of military conscription in the future , the idea of an all-voluntary military continues to circulate .
in an interview in july , germany 's incoming foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said that while conscription had its merits , it was a thing of the past .
ulrich kirsch , the chairman of the federal armed forces association said that the german army was " open to " the idea of an all voluntary force , but more research was needed .
in any event , kirsch noted that changing to an all voluntary army would require amending the constitution , which would take a two-thirds majority , and that that was not going to happen in the near future. av / dpa / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the reaction from all sides has been swift and not all of it is positive . a deal to reduce the period of compulsory military service in germany was worked out between chancellor angela merkel 's incoming government coalition of the conservative union parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
as of january 1 , 2011 , military service will be reduced from nine months to six .
in its election platform , the fdp had called for an abolishment of conscription , however chancellor merkel prefers to keep some form of military service .
as it now stands , young men are obliged to do a compulsory tour of duty in the german military .
they can opt out or refuse , but then must perform " civilian service , " such as working in a hospital , nursing home or other civil organization .
under the new proposal , military service will consist of three months of basic training , two months of specialized training and one month of duty in specialist service units .
the reactions to the deal have been swift and varied .
while werner hoyer , a member of the fdp , called it a reasonable compromise , johannes kahrs , a leader in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the proposal pure nonsense .
" for military service to have any value at all , it should take at least nine months , " said kahrs in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper .
spd defense expert rainer arnold said that lowering the time from nine months to six relegated military service to " an introductory course " instead of a full meal .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mutual distrust kept conscription alive one of the main reasons for conscription and maintaining an army in readiness in the past was the deep mistrust that existed between the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and west germany .
service in the military for all men over the age of 18 became compulsory in 1956 .
the option of doing civil service instead of military service was introduced in 1961 .
over the years , the amount of time one had to serve in the military has been reduced .
in the 1960s it was 18 months .
after january 2002 that number had fallen to nine months .
in the former gdr , compulsory military service was introduced in 1962 .
there are currently about 250,000 men in the german army .
of that amount , 68,270 are conscripts and of those , 25,270 are soldiers who volunteered to remain a few months longer after their mandatory service was up .
future possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association another concern of reducing military service is the concomitant effect on civil service positions that have been filled by men who chose not to serve in the military .
some have said this loss of manpower to civil organizations would be harmful .
but peter tobiassen , the head of an organization that represents conscientious objectors , has said that there are three times as many applicants for those positions than there are jobs available .
while the cdu and csu want to maintain some sort of military conscription in the future , the idea of an all-voluntary military continues to circulate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 24.10.2009 german parties reach coalition deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal came after marathon talks that stretched into the wee hours of saturday chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives are set to form a coalition government after sealing a deal with the free democrats .
the agreement came after the parties struck a compromise on thorny financial issues . the late-night agreement paves the way for a new center-right government to take office next week , nearly a month after merkel 's conservatives and the free democrats won a parliamentary majority in the september 27 federal election .
just hours after reaching consensus , the coalition partners announced plans to cut taxes from january 1 next year . " the burden on families has to be lessened , the burden on companies and inheritance tax has to be reformed , " chancellor merkel said during a press conference in berlin on saturday . " we are aiming for growth , " she said , adding that the new government would focus on education and social cohesion .
" we have agreed a coalition program showing that we want to advance courageously into the future . " at the joint news conference with merkel , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , described the coalition agreement as " a great compass for our country . " sharing key cabinet posts the parties divided up key cabinet posts , with current interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the cdu being chosen to head the finance ministry , while the fdp 's westerwelle is to become foreign minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has earned a reputation as a hardliner when it comes to security policy the 67-year-old schaeuble , who has been bound to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 and has the reputation of being a hardliner on domestic security policy , was a surprise choice for the post of finance minister .
ahead of the september election , he indirectly criticized merkel 's pledge to pursue billions of euros in tax cuts , saying there was little room for them given germany 's strained finances .
now schaeuble will be charged with implementing those cuts against the backdrop of a deficit that is poised to rise to double european union limits next year .
news of his likely appointment sparked mixed reactions in germany on friday .
“ he 's an unknown entity when it comes to financial issues , " dennis snower , head of the kiel-based institute for economic research , told the reuters news agency .
" you ca n't make any predictions about his future financial policy based on what he 's done so far . "
" i think he 's a tough cookie and this is what will be needed , " carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing financial markets said .
" he is someone who would not be afraid of ruining his public image due to unpopular decision-making . "
thomas de maiziere , merkel 's trusted lieutenant as chief of staff , is set to take over schaeble 's job at the interior ministry .
free democrats bag prominent posts as widely expected , the post of foreign minister goes to fdp leader guido westerwelle .
the 47-year-old is the first openly gay leader of a mainstream political party in germany .
he has no foreign policy or government experience .
rainer bruederle , the fdp 's economics spokesman in the parliament for a decade , is set to replace karl-theodor zu guttenberg as economy minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the asian-born free democrat is a surprise pick the media-savvy guttenberg is set to head the defense ministry .
the 37-year-old , who is a member of the csu party , will be in charge of tackling the afghanistan mission which is deeply unpopular in germany .
the free democrats ' phillip roesler is a surprise pick for the post of health minister .
the 36-year-old , a rising star in the fdp , is currently the economy minister in the state of lower saxony and is reported to have led coalition negotiations on healthcare .
born in vietnam , roesler will germany 's first asian-born cabinet minister , also replacing guttenberg as the youngest member of the cabinet .
compromise on tax cuts the deal over the new government came after the conservative bloc and the free democrats managed to reconcile their promise of billions of euros in tax cuts with a separate pledge to get germany 's deficit – swollen by massive stimulus packages – back under control .
horst seehofer , head of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , admitted the final round of negotiations had been bogged down by financial issues .
" the financial issues at the end are always the most difficult and most exciting and you have to do that with great care , " he said , explaining why the talks stretched into the night .
" but it all worked out in the end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer -lrb- r -rrb- admitted that the final round of coalition talks was tough to spur growth , the alliance plans to cut income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- between 2011 and 2013 , according to seehofer .
that is more than the 20 billion euros merkel wanted but far less than 35 billion euros the fdp sought .
" that number is right – even if you did n't hear it from me first , " seehofer said .
" i 'm very pleased with this result , " he added , referring to the coalition agreement after the protracted talks .
" we 've come up with a reasonable plan for the next four years and the coalition has set up a good platform for economic recovery in germany . " rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that ended an 11-year spell in opposition for the fdp and paved the way for it to become the junior coalition partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
it has also handed westerwelle a chance to move on from his role as leader of the opposition and on to greener pastures .
the roles of foreign minister and vice-chancellor are traditionally awarded to the leader of the junior party in federal coalition governments .
westerwelle assumes these positions from social democrat frank-walter steinmeier , who was also the spd 's chancellor candidate in the recent election .
political freshman but with only experience outside of government , and a political career that has barely , if ever , involved foreign relations , some are asking what westerwelle can bring to the position .

" that 's how art historian aby warburg saw himself in his own words . one of his most outstanding achievements was the founding of the warburg cultural studies library , which was officially opened in 1926 .
with four levels , the library was not exactly small , but it was designed in a space-saving manner .
narrow corridors and low doors awaited the visitors behind a red-brick facade .
the library 's infrastructure included the most modern technology of the time for transporting the books from one place to another , including special conveyor belts .
there were 26 telephone connections , a pneumatic tube , and an elevator for books and for staff .
a costly blank check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warburg was a great achiever , though plagued by mental instability warburg financed his library through his father 's banking firm , and later through that of his brother 's , who had moved to the united states .
" when aby was 13 years old , he offered me his firstborn rights , " said warburg 's brother , max .
" since he was the oldest , he was meant to go into the family business .
i was 12 at the time and agreed to buy his firstborn rights .
but he asked me to promise that i would always buy him all the books that he needed .
and , after short consideration , i agreed . "
in this way , warburg 's brother closed the deal - without realizing that this " exchange " involved writing out what was probably the most expensive blank check of his life .
behind the achievement of the library , there was a fragile human being .
with his poor health and bouts of depression , warburg from time to time underwent psychotherapy .
in 1918 , at the end of world war i , he suffered a mental breakdown - a culmination of his phobias , obsessions and delusions .
at the same time , however , he managed to gain widespread acclaim as an art historian , private scholar and researcher .
a non-traditional approach warburg was not interested in a purely aesthetic approach to art history .
his personal focus was the debate over the legacy of antiquity , which he approached with his portrayal of sandro botticelli 's works , the art of florentine painter , works by albrecht duerer and ancient pagan prophecies in written and visual representations .
" one day , i 'm sitting in the library 's lecture room with a newspaper from 1915 , " said rene drommert , a student librarian at the warburg house in the 1920s .
" suddenly , aby warburg appears and says , ' what are you doing there , mr drommert ? '
and i say : ' i 'm interested in the world war i era . '
warburg then bends over the desk and points to an advertisement offering flour and potatoes in exchange for a carpet .
and he says : ' naturally , you have the include things like this to get a good idea of the cultural and social life at the time . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for warburg , art was not just aesthetics , but the way people lived in warburg 's lifetime , the cultural studies library was considered to be an intellectual center in the weimar republic - and it remained that way till after his death on october 26 , 1929 .
many renowned scholars worked in the library 's reading room , including ernst cassirer , erwin panofsky and albert einstein .
according to charles hope , art historian and director of the warburg institute in london , what stands out is the prevalence of jewish scholars at the library .
" in my opinion , these people did not think that their jewishness had a large influence on their scholarliness , " said hope .
" their jewish background was of limited importance to them . "
second start in england this was until the rise of the nazi party threatened the library 's survival and forced it to move to london , which it did on december 12 , 1933 .
thanks to generous support on the british side , the library was preserved .
today , with 350,000 books , it is called the warburg institute and it is still one of the most significant humanities-oriented book collections in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cultural studies library is one of europe 's most important book collections the library gained its good reputation thanks to its unusual collection of books , as well as its interdisciplinary classification system , which links together very different subject areas : psychology and anthropology , theater , celebration and music , astrology and astronomy , chemistry and mathematics .
warburg himself had arranged the books in an interdisciplinary manner , and even the library 's architectural details reflected his educational motivations .
in the center was an oval reading and lecture room , because " warburg wanted an elliptical shape , as he believed that it helps people stay alert , whereas a circular room makes you sleepy , " according to hamburg art historian and warburg scholar martin warnke .
" also , it was because astronomer johannes kepler had proved that the earth and other planets followed an elliptical orbit , " said warnke .

on friday , the staunch eurosceptic accepted a proposal by the swedish eu presidency to handle an opt-out from the treaty which he demands .
" this proposal corresponds to the president 's expectations and he can continue to work with it , " said klaus 's office .
critics of the czech president regard the demand as another attempt to delay the ratification .
however , friday 's statement by klaus 's office is the second glimmer of hope for the eu in a week , after the president suggested just days ago that he would ultimately sign .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , no matter how much some of us would want that , " he said last saturday , fueling hopes that the treaty might take effect soon .
exemption clause on property two weeks ago , klaus asked for an exemption from the treaty that would prevent ethnic germans forced out of his country after world war ii from reclaiming their property .
britain and poland won similar exemptions during the treaty negotiations in 2007 – catholic poland was assured it would not be forced to allow gay marriages , and britain promised that eu laws and courts would not prevail over its own judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso is unable to set up a new commission due to delays to the lisbon treaty stefan fule , czech minister for eu affairs , said the czech exemption would be a general one , comprising a comma and the words " czech republic " attached to " great britain " and " poland " in the treaty 's protocol .
recognizing that the chances that klaus might yield were slim , sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the czech cabinet set out to work on the wording of the exemption , which they hope to submit to the eu for approval at a summit next week .
european commission held up the eu has been waiting in suspense for klaus ' signature , the last step in the czech ratification process after local lawmakers approved the treaty earlier this year .
the impasse means that european commission chief jose manuel barroso , who was last month granted a second five-year term , is unable to nominate a new commission , because it is unclear what legal basis he should use .
the mandate of the current commission – the eu 's executive arm – expires at the end of october .
the body that draws up legislation impacting the lives of about half a billion europeans and policing the application of eu laws is likely to remain a lame duck until the future becomes clearer .
this may take some time as klaus has also linked his signature to a go-ahead from the top czech court , which is currently assessing the treaty 's compliance with the country 's constitution following a complaint filed by a group of eurosceptic senators .
like president klaus , the senators fear the treaty will give too much power to brussels and threaten czech sovereignty .
the court has said it will discuss the complaint in a public hearing on tuesday , but it is unclear how long the process might take .
concerns over further hurdles the president of the european parliament , jerzy buzek , said on friday he expected the lisbon reform treaty to come into force before the end of the year while admitting that challenges persisted .
" it 's my personal opinion : i can say that it 's a very high probability that we will have our lisbon treaty in place at the end of this year , " he said in an interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus recently conceded that the lisbon treaty is inevitable however , buzek voiced concerns an opt-out deal with the czechs could " bring problems in other member states " .
" we would like to have a solution proper for the czech republic and for president klaus to sign the lisbon treaty .
but of course we would n't like to have problems in other member states , " he said .
concerns that more countries may try to negotiate footnotes to the charter intensified last week after slovak prime minister robert fico said he may ask for an opt-out clause for his country if the czechs succeed. rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this remains the dream of three stars who left germany in search of the big prize . whatever a player may tell you about his priorities , the champions league is the holy grail .
to hold the hugely iconic trophy known fondly as " old big ears " aloft tells the world that you have reached the pinnacle of the european game , that you have battled and beaten some of the best clubs in the world . domestic success bestows great honor on a player but being crowned european champion is not only in a different league , it ’ s in a completely different kingdom . reaching the top in your domestic league does n't always guarantee that you can make that leap to the next stage .
you can be playing for the very best , have league titles and cups threatening to collapse your trophy cabinet , and yet still have that grecian urn on steroids missing from your collection . just ask michael ballack .
in may of 2002 , a fresh-faced ballack was 90 minutes away from lifting " old big ears " as the rising star of a hugely over-achieving bayer leverkusen team .
while bayer went on to blow a league title which was theirs to lose , they were probably the best team in the bundesliga that season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's move to bayern failed to bring him the cup he covets it was with that knowledge that ballack and co. faced real madrid in the european cup final . however , a stroke of zinedine zidane genius added a dose of reality to bayer 's pretensions , snatched the title away from ballack and imploded leverkusen 's season in one fierce volley . maybe ballack left for bayern munich later that year in search of the bundesliga title that so cruelly eluded him at bayer leverkusen .
it 's more likely , however , that he joined bayern – a team that lifted the champions league trophy only a year before – because of what he saw as a better chance to win the european cup . ironically , bayer leverkusen went further in europe than bayern in ballack 's first season in bavaria , as munich failed to make it past the first group stage .
ballack got closer the following year when bayern reached the last 16 , again losing to real madrid . he went even closer in 2005 when bayern lost to chelsea in the quarter-final .
but by 2006 , when bayern started to take backwards steps in europe , it became clear that ballack had to leave if he wanted to become a european champion . to the island in joining chelsea , a team which had just secured back-to-back english premiership titles and reached european semi-finals in the previous two seasons , ballack saw a real chance to make his dream a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and chelsea were one spot-kick away from glory chelsea were on the cusp of european glory – everyone believed it was only a matter of time -lrb- not to mention money -rrb- .
in his first season with the blues , however , chelsea again stuttered at the semi-final stage .
the following year , however , presented ballack with another chance to come out on top in a final .
again , he ended up on the losing side but as it came after a cruel penalty shoot-out , an optimist could say it was closest he 'd come to date . last season , it was disappointment again at the semi-final stage as chelsea lost to eventual champions barcelona . this year , even at this early stage , chelsea again look like they will be contenders , winning three games out of three in their group stage , despite not playing their best .
ballack seems to fit into new coach carlo ancelotti 's team plan and so if things progress and chelsea advance , ballack 's move to london in search of european success may yet bear fruit . bremen to juventus but ballack is not the only star to leave the bundesliga in search of europe 's biggest prize . despite being an integral part of a werder bremen team which played exciting soccer and looked as though they had the future potential to capture silverware at home and abroad , brazilian playmaker diego left the german club for juventus in may this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's move has improved his chances of euro success becoming a serie a champion has as much cache as winning any domestic league but it remains unlikely that diego purely had designs on the scudetto when he joined the blanconeri .
diego may have increased his chances of becoming a league champion by joining juventus , with werder bremen seemingly stalled as exciting also-rans , but his chances of winning the champions league rose exponentially when he put pen to paper in turin in may . bremen had qualified for the champions league in each of the three seasons that diego featured but their shortcomings were frequently exposed .
in the three champions league campaigns of diego ’ s werder career , bremen managed to finish third in their qualifying group in the first two , dropping into the uefa cup as a result , but failed to qualify through their disappointing bundesliga placing in his final season . this year , as a juventus player , diego is performing in a team which has ambitions in the champions league way beyond that which the brazilian achieved with werder . two draws and one win from three games may not be form to set the heart a flutter but juve sit in second place sandwiched between bayern munich in third and group leaders bordeaux .
last-placed club maccabi haifa aside , group a looks like a tough ride .
should juventus qualify , diego ’ s dream may yet live on a little longer . off in search of silver one other player who left the bundesliga with " old big ears " in mind is christoph metzelder . in the german defender 's seven year stint at borussia dortmund , a solitary bundesliga title won in his second season with the club was as good as it was ever going to get and although it may have been a surprise that he ended up at real madrid , it was no shock that metzelder decided to move on after so many barren years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzelder may have signed on to win but will he play ?
again , joining a club with the standing of real madrid certainly raised metzelder 's chances of domestic silverware – which he achieved with a spanish league title and supercup medal in his first season – but signing for the record holders for the most european cup wins must have figured in the defender 's reasoning for swapping the ruhrgebiet for the spanish capital . since leaving for madrid in 2007 , however los blancos have failed to live up to those famous sides which fill the pages of the record books .
in his first season , real were undone by as roma in the first knock-out round and were hammered at the same stage by liverpool the following year .
this year , however , despite losing to ac milan , real madrid have looked like a tasty proposition with the embarrassment of riches coach manuel pelligrini has at his disposal . this , however , may be a hindrance to metzelder personally .
while the hugely talented squad may win the 2009/10 champions league , whether metzelder plays in the team is another matter . moving to a club capable of winning the champions league is one thing .

this remains the dream of three stars who left germany in search of the big prize . whatever a player may tell you about his priorities , the champions league is the holy grail .
to hold the hugely iconic trophy known fondly as " old big ears " aloft tells the world that you have reached the pinnacle of the european game , that you have battled and beaten some of the best clubs in the world . domestic success bestows great honor on a player but being crowned european champion is not only in a different league , it ’ s in a completely different kingdom . reaching the top in your domestic league does n't always guarantee that you can make that leap to the next stage .
you can be playing for the very best , have league titles and cups threatening to collapse your trophy cabinet , and yet still have that grecian urn on steroids missing from your collection . just ask michael ballack .
in may of 2002 , a fresh-faced ballack was 90 minutes away from lifting " old big ears " as the rising star of a hugely over-achieving bayer leverkusen team .
while bayer went on to blow a league title which was theirs to lose , they were probably the best team in the bundesliga that season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's move to bayern failed to bring him the cup he covets it was with that knowledge that ballack and co. faced real madrid in the european cup final . however , a stroke of zinedine zidane genius added a dose of reality to bayer 's pretensions , snatched the title away from ballack and imploded leverkusen 's season in one fierce volley . maybe ballack left for bayern munich later that year in search of the bundesliga title that so cruelly eluded him at bayer leverkusen .
it 's more likely , however , that he joined bayern – a team that lifted the champions league trophy only a year before – because of what he saw as a better chance to win the european cup . ironically , bayer leverkusen went further in europe than bayern in ballack 's first season in bavaria , as munich failed to make it past the first group stage .
ballack got closer the following year when bayern reached the last 16 , again losing to real madrid . he went even closer in 2005 when bayern lost to chelsea in the quarter-final .
but by 2006 , when bayern started to take backwards steps in europe , it became clear that ballack had to leave if he wanted to become a european champion . to the island in joining chelsea , a team which had just secured back-to-back english premiership titles and reached european semi-finals in the previous two seasons , ballack saw a real chance to make his dream a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and chelsea were one spot-kick away from glory chelsea were on the cusp of european glory – everyone believed it was only a matter of time -lrb- not to mention money -rrb- .
in his first season with the blues , however , chelsea again stuttered at the semi-final stage .
the following year , however , presented ballack with another chance to come out on top in a final .
again , he ended up on the losing side but as it came after a cruel penalty shoot-out , an optimist could say it was closest he 'd come to date . last season , it was disappointment again at the semi-final stage as chelsea lost to eventual champions barcelona . this year , even at this early stage , chelsea again look like they will be contenders , winning three games out of three in their group stage , despite not playing their best .
ballack seems to fit into new coach carlo ancelotti 's team plan and so if things progress and chelsea advance , ballack 's move to london in search of european success may yet bear fruit . bremen to juventus but ballack is not the only star to leave the bundesliga in search of europe 's biggest prize . despite being an integral part of a werder bremen team which played exciting soccer and looked as though they had the future potential to capture silverware at home and abroad , brazilian playmaker diego left the german club for juventus in may this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's move has improved his chances of euro success becoming a serie a champion has as much cache as winning any domestic league but it remains unlikely that diego purely had designs on the scudetto when he joined the blanconeri .
diego may have increased his chances of becoming a league champion by joining juventus , with werder bremen seemingly stalled as exciting also-rans , but his chances of winning the champions league rose exponentially when he put pen to paper in turin in may . bremen had qualified for the champions league in each of the three seasons that diego featured but their shortcomings were frequently exposed .
in the three champions league campaigns of diego ’ s werder career , bremen managed to finish third in their qualifying group in the first two , dropping into the uefa cup as a result , but failed to qualify through their disappointing bundesliga placing in his final season . this year , as a juventus player , diego is performing in a team which has ambitions in the champions league way beyond that which the brazilian achieved with werder . two draws and one win from three games may not be form to set the heart a flutter but juve sit in second place sandwiched between bayern munich in third and group leaders bordeaux .
last-placed club maccabi haifa aside , group a looks like a tough ride .
should juventus qualify , diego ’ s dream may yet live on a little longer . off in search of silver one other player who left the bundesliga with " old big ears " in mind is christoph metzelder . in the german defender 's seven year stint at borussia dortmund , a solitary bundesliga title won in his second season with the club was as good as it was ever going to get and although it may have been a surprise that he ended up at real madrid , it was no shock that metzelder decided to move on after so many barren years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzelder may have signed on to win but will he play ?
again , joining a club with the standing of real madrid certainly raised metzelder 's chances of domestic silverware – which he achieved with a spanish league title and supercup medal in his first season – but signing for the record holders for the most european cup wins must have figured in the defender 's reasoning for swapping the ruhrgebiet for the spanish capital . since leaving for madrid in 2007 , however los blancos have failed to live up to those famous sides which fill the pages of the record books .
in his first season , real were undone by as roma in the first knock-out round and were hammered at the same stage by liverpool the following year .
this year , however , despite losing to ac milan , real madrid have looked like a tasty proposition with the embarrassment of riches coach manuel pelligrini has at his disposal . this , however , may be a hindrance to metzelder personally .
while the hugely talented squad may win the 2009/10 champions league , whether metzelder plays in the team is another matter . moving to a club capable of winning the champions league is one thing .
actually playing for that team is another . author : nick amies editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this remains the dream of three stars who left germany in search of the big prize . whatever a player may tell you about his priorities , the champions league is the holy grail .
to hold the hugely iconic trophy known fondly as " old big ears " aloft tells the world that you have reached the pinnacle of the european game , that you have battled and beaten some of the best clubs in the world . domestic success bestows great honor on a player but being crowned european champion is not only in a different league , it ’ s in a completely different kingdom . reaching the top in your domestic league does n't always guarantee that you can make that leap to the next stage .
you can be playing for the very best , have league titles and cups threatening to collapse your trophy cabinet , and yet still have that grecian urn on steroids missing from your collection . just ask michael ballack .
in may of 2002 , a fresh-faced ballack was 90 minutes away from lifting " old big ears " as the rising star of a hugely over-achieving bayer leverkusen team .
while bayer went on to blow a league title which was theirs to lose , they were probably the best team in the bundesliga that season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's move to bayern failed to bring him the cup he covets it was with that knowledge that ballack and co. faced real madrid in the european cup final . however , a stroke of zinedine zidane genius added a dose of reality to bayer 's pretensions , snatched the title away from ballack and imploded leverkusen 's season in one fierce volley . maybe ballack left for bayern munich later that year in search of the bundesliga title that so cruelly eluded him at bayer leverkusen .
it 's more likely , however , that he joined bayern – a team that lifted the champions league trophy only a year before – because of what he saw as a better chance to win the european cup . ironically , bayer leverkusen went further in europe than bayern in ballack 's first season in bavaria , as munich failed to make it past the first group stage .
ballack got closer the following year when bayern reached the last 16 , again losing to real madrid . he went even closer in 2005 when bayern lost to chelsea in the quarter-final .
but by 2006 , when bayern started to take backwards steps in europe , it became clear that ballack had to leave if he wanted to become a european champion . to the island in joining chelsea , a team which had just secured back-to-back english premiership titles and reached european semi-finals in the previous two seasons , ballack saw a real chance to make his dream a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and chelsea were one spot-kick away from glory chelsea were on the cusp of european glory – everyone believed it was only a matter of time -lrb- not to mention money -rrb- .
in his first season with the blues , however , chelsea again stuttered at the semi-final stage .
the following year , however , presented ballack with another chance to come out on top in a final .
again , he ended up on the losing side but as it came after a cruel penalty shoot-out , an optimist could say it was closest he 'd come to date . last season , it was disappointment again at the semi-final stage as chelsea lost to eventual champions barcelona . this year , even at this early stage , chelsea again look like they will be contenders , winning three games out of three in their group stage , despite not playing their best .
ballack seems to fit into new coach carlo ancelotti 's team plan and so if things progress and chelsea advance , ballack 's move to london in search of european success may yet bear fruit . bremen to juventus but ballack is not the only star to leave the bundesliga in search of europe 's biggest prize . despite being an integral part of a werder bremen team which played exciting soccer and looked as though they had the future potential to capture silverware at home and abroad , brazilian playmaker diego left the german club for juventus in may this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's move has improved his chances of euro success becoming a serie a champion has as much cache as winning any domestic league but it remains unlikely that diego purely had designs on the scudetto when he joined the blanconeri .
diego may have increased his chances of becoming a league champion by joining juventus , with werder bremen seemingly stalled as exciting also-rans , but his chances of winning the champions league rose exponentially when he put pen to paper in turin in may . bremen had qualified for the champions league in each of the three seasons that diego featured but their shortcomings were frequently exposed .
in the three champions league campaigns of diego ’ s werder career , bremen managed to finish third in their qualifying group in the first two , dropping into the uefa cup as a result , but failed to qualify through their disappointing bundesliga placing in his final season . this year , as a juventus player , diego is performing in a team which has ambitions in the champions league way beyond that which the brazilian achieved with werder . two draws and one win from three games may not be form to set the heart a flutter but juve sit in second place sandwiched between bayern munich in third and group leaders bordeaux .
last-placed club maccabi haifa aside , group a looks like a tough ride .
should juventus qualify , diego ’ s dream may yet live on a little longer . off in search of silver one other player who left the bundesliga with " old big ears " in mind is christoph metzelder . in the german defender 's seven year stint at borussia dortmund , a solitary bundesliga title won in his second season with the club was as good as it was ever going to get and although it may have been a surprise that he ended up at real madrid , it was no shock that metzelder decided to move on after so many barren years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzelder may have signed on to win but will he play ?
again , joining a club with the standing of real madrid certainly raised metzelder 's chances of domestic silverware – which he achieved with a spanish league title and supercup medal in his first season – but signing for the record holders for the most european cup wins must have figured in the defender 's reasoning for swapping the ruhrgebiet for the spanish capital . since leaving for madrid in 2007 , however los blancos have failed to live up to those famous sides which fill the pages of the record books .
in his first season , real were undone by as roma in the first knock-out round and were hammered at the same stage by liverpool the following year .
this year , however , despite losing to ac milan , real madrid have looked like a tasty proposition with the embarrassment of riches coach manuel pelligrini has at his disposal . this , however , may be a hindrance to metzelder personally .
while the hugely talented squad may win the 2009/10 champions league , whether metzelder plays in the team is another matter . moving to a club capable of winning the champions league is one thing .
actually playing for that team is another . author : nick amies editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 24.10.2009 jewish scholar challenged tradition with creation of unique library großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warburg examined the influence of the antiquity on later works a library established by hamburg-born jewish art historian aby m. warburg narrowly escaped destruction by the nazis to become one of the most significant book collections in europe to this day . he was " a jew by birth , a florentine in spirit , and a hamburger at heart . " that 's how art historian aby warburg saw himself in his own words . one of his most outstanding achievements was the founding of the warburg cultural studies library , which was officially opened in 1926 .
with four levels , the library was not exactly small , but it was designed in a space-saving manner .
narrow corridors and low doors awaited the visitors behind a red-brick facade .
the library 's infrastructure included the most modern technology of the time for transporting the books from one place to another , including special conveyor belts .
there were 26 telephone connections , a pneumatic tube , and an elevator for books and for staff .
a costly blank check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warburg was a great achiever , though plagued by mental instability warburg financed his library through his father 's banking firm , and later through that of his brother 's , who had moved to the united states .
" when aby was 13 years old , he offered me his firstborn rights , " said warburg 's brother , max .
" since he was the oldest , he was meant to go into the family business .
i was 12 at the time and agreed to buy his firstborn rights .
but he asked me to promise that i would always buy him all the books that he needed .
and , after short consideration , i agreed . "
in this way , warburg 's brother closed the deal - without realizing that this " exchange " involved writing out what was probably the most expensive blank check of his life .
behind the achievement of the library , there was a fragile human being .
with his poor health and bouts of depression , warburg from time to time underwent psychotherapy .
in 1918 , at the end of world war i , he suffered a mental breakdown - a culmination of his phobias , obsessions and delusions .
at the same time , however , he managed to gain widespread acclaim as an art historian , private scholar and researcher .
a non-traditional approach warburg was not interested in a purely aesthetic approach to art history .
his personal focus was the debate over the legacy of antiquity , which he approached with his portrayal of sandro botticelli 's works , the art of florentine painter , works by albrecht duerer and ancient pagan prophecies in written and visual representations .
" one day , i 'm sitting in the library 's lecture room with a newspaper from 1915 , " said rene drommert , a student librarian at the warburg house in the 1920s .
" suddenly , aby warburg appears and says , ' what are you doing there , mr drommert ? '
and i say : ' i 'm interested in the world war i era . '
warburg then bends over the desk and points to an advertisement offering flour and potatoes in exchange for a carpet .
and he says : ' naturally , you have the include things like this to get a good idea of the cultural and social life at the time . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for warburg , art was not just aesthetics , but the way people lived in warburg 's lifetime , the cultural studies library was considered to be an intellectual center in the weimar republic - and it remained that way till after his death on october 26 , 1929 .
many renowned scholars worked in the library 's reading room , including ernst cassirer , erwin panofsky and albert einstein .
according to charles hope , art historian and director of the warburg institute in london , what stands out is the prevalence of jewish scholars at the library .
" in my opinion , these people did not think that their jewishness had a large influence on their scholarliness , " said hope .
" their jewish background was of limited importance to them . "
second start in england this was until the rise of the nazi party threatened the library 's survival and forced it to move to london , which it did on december 12 , 1933 .
thanks to generous support on the british side , the library was preserved .
today , with 350,000 books , it is called the warburg institute and it is still one of the most significant humanities-oriented book collections in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cultural studies library is one of europe 's most important book collections the library gained its good reputation thanks to its unusual collection of books , as well as its interdisciplinary classification system , which links together very different subject areas : psychology and anthropology , theater , celebration and music , astrology and astronomy , chemistry and mathematics .
warburg himself had arranged the books in an interdisciplinary manner , and even the library 's architectural details reflected his educational motivations .
in the center was an oval reading and lecture room , because " warburg wanted an elliptical shape , as he believed that it helps people stay alert , whereas a circular room makes you sleepy , " according to hamburg art historian and warburg scholar martin warnke .
" also , it was because astronomer johannes kepler had proved that the earth and other planets followed an elliptical orbit , " said warnke .

but with no ministerial or foreign affairs experience , what does he bring to the table ? guido westerwelle , 47 , led the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to their best-ever result in the september 27 election , with the party taking just under 15 percent of the vote .
that ended an 11-year spell in opposition for the fdp and paved the way for it to become the junior coalition partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
it has also handed westerwelle a chance to move on from his role as leader of the opposition and on to greener pastures .
the roles of foreign minister and vice-chancellor are traditionally awarded to the leader of the junior party in federal coalition governments .
westerwelle assumes these positions from social democrat frank-walter steinmeier , who was also the spd 's chancellor candidate in the recent election .
political freshman but with only experience outside of government , and a political career that has barely , if ever , involved foreign relations , some are asking what westerwelle can bring to the position .
he has little direct experience of foreign policy but has recently made some visits abroad , including to russia .
his party is pro-american and westerwelle is not expected to deviate from the approach of his predecessors , nor from the " basic tenets " of post-war german foreign policy .
on saturday , oct .
24 , westerwelle said nuclear non-proliferation and the removal of us atomic warheads from german soil would be a priority for his ministry .
merkel has said this would be achieved through dialog with germany 's partners in the nato forum .
westerwelle is also known to be a supporter of stronger trans-atlantic ties , and is a member of the non-partisan atlantik bruecke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization , dedicated to achieving this goal .
but that wo n't necessarily mean that germany will give in to us wishes to commit more troops to afghanistan .
while westerwelle has been vague on many foreign-policy points , he has stated clearly his aversion to any expansion in german army operations under nato .
questions over effectiveness but westerwelle is bound to make waves for being europe 's first openly gay foreign minister , having publicly " come out " at merkel 's 50th birthday party .
the trained lawyer has dismissed any notion that this could pose problems in his role as foreign minister .
" some other countries may have had a problem with the fact that angela merkel became the first female chancellor of germany .
of course she does not wear a veil on the red carpet when she visits certain arab states , " he has been quoted as saying .
" the decision as to whom we send as a government representative rests solely with us germans , based on our political and moral standards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle introduced his partner michael mronz , right , some five years ago born in bad honnef , near bonn in western germany , westerwelle was elected to the german parliament in 1996 and became head of the fdp in 2001 .
westerwelle 's seeming reluctance to speak english has raised some questions about his suitability for the post of germany 's top diplomat .
westerwelle declined to answer a question in english that had been put to him by a bbc reporter during his first news conference after last month 's elections . " in great britain it is expected that people speak english , and it is the same in germany - people are expected to speak german , " westerwelle said at the time , prompting heated debate on the internet .
on the domestic front , the thorniest issue for westerwelle has been over tax cuts .
the free democrats had promised voters 35 billion euros worth of cuts in the recent election , but merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wanted only 15 billion euros .
on saturday , the coalition partners put this issue to bed , agreeing on 24 billion euros in cuts. dfm / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plans have met with praise from industry leaders but germany 's political opposition and environmental groups have slammed them as unrealistic and damaging .

greenpeace described the coalition 's plans as a " clear failure when it comes to protecting the environment . "
allowing a longer life span to older nuclear plants is a " fatal sign " according to greenpeace .

but with no ministerial or foreign affairs experience , what does he bring to the table ? guido westerwelle , 47 , led the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to their best-ever result in the september 27 election , with the party taking just under 15 percent of the vote .
that ended an 11-year spell in opposition for the fdp and paved the way for it to become the junior coalition partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
it has also handed westerwelle a chance to move on from his role as leader of the opposition and on to greener pastures .
the roles of foreign minister and vice-chancellor are traditionally awarded to the leader of the junior party in federal coalition governments .
westerwelle assumes these positions from social democrat frank-walter steinmeier , who was also the spd 's chancellor candidate in the recent election .
political freshman but with only experience outside of government , and a political career that has barely , if ever , involved foreign relations , some are asking what westerwelle can bring to the position .
he has little direct experience of foreign policy but has recently made some visits abroad , including to russia .
his party is pro-american and westerwelle is not expected to deviate from the approach of his predecessors , nor from the " basic tenets " of post-war german foreign policy .
on saturday , oct .
24 , westerwelle said nuclear non-proliferation and the removal of us atomic warheads from german soil would be a priority for his ministry .
merkel has said this would be achieved through dialog with germany 's partners in the nato forum .
westerwelle is also known to be a supporter of stronger trans-atlantic ties , and is a member of the non-partisan atlantik bruecke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization , dedicated to achieving this goal .
but that wo n't necessarily mean that germany will give in to us wishes to commit more troops to afghanistan .
while westerwelle has been vague on many foreign-policy points , he has stated clearly his aversion to any expansion in german army operations under nato .
questions over effectiveness but westerwelle is bound to make waves for being europe 's first openly gay foreign minister , having publicly " come out " at merkel 's 50th birthday party .
the trained lawyer has dismissed any notion that this could pose problems in his role as foreign minister .
" some other countries may have had a problem with the fact that angela merkel became the first female chancellor of germany .
of course she does not wear a veil on the red carpet when she visits certain arab states , " he has been quoted as saying .
" the decision as to whom we send as a government representative rests solely with us germans , based on our political and moral standards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle introduced his partner michael mronz , right , some five years ago born in bad honnef , near bonn in western germany , westerwelle was elected to the german parliament in 1996 and became head of the fdp in 2001 .
westerwelle 's seeming reluctance to speak english has raised some questions about his suitability for the post of germany 's top diplomat .
westerwelle declined to answer a question in english that had been put to him by a bbc reporter during his first news conference after last month 's elections . " in great britain it is expected that people speak english , and it is the same in germany - people are expected to speak german , " westerwelle said at the time , prompting heated debate on the internet .
on the domestic front , the thorniest issue for westerwelle has been over tax cuts .
the free democrats had promised voters 35 billion euros worth of cuts in the recent election , but merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wanted only 15 billion euros .
on saturday , the coalition partners put this issue to bed , agreeing on 24 billion euros in cuts. dfm / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 24.10.2009 -rrb- experts support westerwelle 's quest to rid germany of us nuclear arms the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .

gladbacher juan arango was off target with a free kick from 25 meters nearing the 40-minute mark , while cologne frontman manasseh ishiaku , who picked up a yellow card midway through the first half , fired wide after being offered a chance off a lukas podolski pass .
the result means cologne moves up to 13th place , while gladbach climb one spot above the relegation zone to 15th. dfm / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 24.10.2009 mixed fortunes for ex-bundesliga stars who jumped ship for euro glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego , ballack and metzelder left to improve their chances success and adoration in your domestic league is one thing , winning the european cup and being the toast of the continent is another .
this remains the dream of three stars who left germany in search of the big prize . whatever a player may tell you about his priorities , the champions league is the holy grail .
to hold the hugely iconic trophy known fondly as " old big ears " aloft tells the world that you have reached the pinnacle of the european game , that you have battled and beaten some of the best clubs in the world . domestic success bestows great honor on a player but being crowned european champion is not only in a different league , it ’ s in a completely different kingdom . reaching the top in your domestic league does n't always guarantee that you can make that leap to the next stage .
you can be playing for the very best , have league titles and cups threatening to collapse your trophy cabinet , and yet still have that grecian urn on steroids missing from your collection . just ask michael ballack .
in may of 2002 , a fresh-faced ballack was 90 minutes away from lifting " old big ears " as the rising star of a hugely over-achieving bayer leverkusen team .
while bayer went on to blow a league title which was theirs to lose , they were probably the best team in the bundesliga that season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's move to bayern failed to bring him the cup he covets it was with that knowledge that ballack and co. faced real madrid in the european cup final . however , a stroke of zinedine zidane genius added a dose of reality to bayer 's pretensions , snatched the title away from ballack and imploded leverkusen 's season in one fierce volley . maybe ballack left for bayern munich later that year in search of the bundesliga title that so cruelly eluded him at bayer leverkusen .
it 's more likely , however , that he joined bayern – a team that lifted the champions league trophy only a year before – because of what he saw as a better chance to win the european cup . ironically , bayer leverkusen went further in europe than bayern in ballack 's first season in bavaria , as munich failed to make it past the first group stage .
ballack got closer the following year when bayern reached the last 16 , again losing to real madrid . he went even closer in 2005 when bayern lost to chelsea in the quarter-final .
but by 2006 , when bayern started to take backwards steps in europe , it became clear that ballack had to leave if he wanted to become a european champion . to the island in joining chelsea , a team which had just secured back-to-back english premiership titles and reached european semi-finals in the previous two seasons , ballack saw a real chance to make his dream a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and chelsea were one spot-kick away from glory chelsea were on the cusp of european glory – everyone believed it was only a matter of time -lrb- not to mention money -rrb- .
in his first season with the blues , however , chelsea again stuttered at the semi-final stage .
the following year , however , presented ballack with another chance to come out on top in a final .
again , he ended up on the losing side but as it came after a cruel penalty shoot-out , an optimist could say it was closest he 'd come to date . last season , it was disappointment again at the semi-final stage as chelsea lost to eventual champions barcelona . this year , even at this early stage , chelsea again look like they will be contenders , winning three games out of three in their group stage , despite not playing their best .
ballack seems to fit into new coach carlo ancelotti 's team plan and so if things progress and chelsea advance , ballack 's move to london in search of european success may yet bear fruit . bremen to juventus but ballack is not the only star to leave the bundesliga in search of europe 's biggest prize . despite being an integral part of a werder bremen team which played exciting soccer and looked as though they had the future potential to capture silverware at home and abroad , brazilian playmaker diego left the german club for juventus in may this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's move has improved his chances of euro success becoming a serie a champion has as much cache as winning any domestic league but it remains unlikely that diego purely had designs on the scudetto when he joined the blanconeri .
diego may have increased his chances of becoming a league champion by joining juventus , with werder bremen seemingly stalled as exciting also-rans , but his chances of winning the champions league rose exponentially when he put pen to paper in turin in may . bremen had qualified for the champions league in each of the three seasons that diego featured but their shortcomings were frequently exposed .
in the three champions league campaigns of diego ’ s werder career , bremen managed to finish third in their qualifying group in the first two , dropping into the uefa cup as a result , but failed to qualify through their disappointing bundesliga placing in his final season . this year , as a juventus player , diego is performing in a team which has ambitions in the champions league way beyond that which the brazilian achieved with werder . two draws and one win from three games may not be form to set the heart a flutter but juve sit in second place sandwiched between bayern munich in third and group leaders bordeaux .
last-placed club maccabi haifa aside , group a looks like a tough ride .
should juventus qualify , diego ’ s dream may yet live on a little longer . off in search of silver one other player who left the bundesliga with " old big ears " in mind is christoph metzelder . in the german defender 's seven year stint at borussia dortmund , a solitary bundesliga title won in his second season with the club was as good as it was ever going to get and although it may have been a surprise that he ended up at real madrid , it was no shock that metzelder decided to move on after so many barren years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzelder may have signed on to win but will he play ?
again , joining a club with the standing of real madrid certainly raised metzelder 's chances of domestic silverware – which he achieved with a spanish league title and supercup medal in his first season – but signing for the record holders for the most european cup wins must have figured in the defender 's reasoning for swapping the ruhrgebiet for the spanish capital . since leaving for madrid in 2007 , however los blancos have failed to live up to those famous sides which fill the pages of the record books .
in his first season , real were undone by as roma in the first knock-out round and were hammered at the same stage by liverpool the following year .
this year , however , despite losing to ac milan , real madrid have looked like a tasty proposition with the embarrassment of riches coach manuel pelligrini has at his disposal . this , however , may be a hindrance to metzelder personally .

this remains the dream of three stars who left germany in search of the big prize . whatever a player may tell you about his priorities , the champions league is the holy grail .
to hold the hugely iconic trophy known fondly as " old big ears " aloft tells the world that you have reached the pinnacle of the european game , that you have battled and beaten some of the best clubs in the world . domestic success bestows great honor on a player but being crowned european champion is not only in a different league , it ’ s in a completely different kingdom . reaching the top in your domestic league does n't always guarantee that you can make that leap to the next stage .
you can be playing for the very best , have league titles and cups threatening to collapse your trophy cabinet , and yet still have that grecian urn on steroids missing from your collection . just ask michael ballack .
in may of 2002 , a fresh-faced ballack was 90 minutes away from lifting " old big ears " as the rising star of a hugely over-achieving bayer leverkusen team .
while bayer went on to blow a league title which was theirs to lose , they were probably the best team in the bundesliga that season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's move to bayern failed to bring him the cup he covets it was with that knowledge that ballack and co. faced real madrid in the european cup final . however , a stroke of zinedine zidane genius added a dose of reality to bayer 's pretensions , snatched the title away from ballack and imploded leverkusen 's season in one fierce volley . maybe ballack left for bayern munich later that year in search of the bundesliga title that so cruelly eluded him at bayer leverkusen .
it 's more likely , however , that he joined bayern – a team that lifted the champions league trophy only a year before – because of what he saw as a better chance to win the european cup . ironically , bayer leverkusen went further in europe than bayern in ballack 's first season in bavaria , as munich failed to make it past the first group stage .
ballack got closer the following year when bayern reached the last 16 , again losing to real madrid . he went even closer in 2005 when bayern lost to chelsea in the quarter-final .
but by 2006 , when bayern started to take backwards steps in europe , it became clear that ballack had to leave if he wanted to become a european champion . to the island in joining chelsea , a team which had just secured back-to-back english premiership titles and reached european semi-finals in the previous two seasons , ballack saw a real chance to make his dream a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and chelsea were one spot-kick away from glory chelsea were on the cusp of european glory – everyone believed it was only a matter of time -lrb- not to mention money -rrb- .
in his first season with the blues , however , chelsea again stuttered at the semi-final stage .
the following year , however , presented ballack with another chance to come out on top in a final .
again , he ended up on the losing side but as it came after a cruel penalty shoot-out , an optimist could say it was closest he 'd come to date . last season , it was disappointment again at the semi-final stage as chelsea lost to eventual champions barcelona . this year , even at this early stage , chelsea again look like they will be contenders , winning three games out of three in their group stage , despite not playing their best .
ballack seems to fit into new coach carlo ancelotti 's team plan and so if things progress and chelsea advance , ballack 's move to london in search of european success may yet bear fruit . bremen to juventus but ballack is not the only star to leave the bundesliga in search of europe 's biggest prize . despite being an integral part of a werder bremen team which played exciting soccer and looked as though they had the future potential to capture silverware at home and abroad , brazilian playmaker diego left the german club for juventus in may this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's move has improved his chances of euro success becoming a serie a champion has as much cache as winning any domestic league but it remains unlikely that diego purely had designs on the scudetto when he joined the blanconeri .
diego may have increased his chances of becoming a league champion by joining juventus , with werder bremen seemingly stalled as exciting also-rans , but his chances of winning the champions league rose exponentially when he put pen to paper in turin in may . bremen had qualified for the champions league in each of the three seasons that diego featured but their shortcomings were frequently exposed .
in the three champions league campaigns of diego ’ s werder career , bremen managed to finish third in their qualifying group in the first two , dropping into the uefa cup as a result , but failed to qualify through their disappointing bundesliga placing in his final season . this year , as a juventus player , diego is performing in a team which has ambitions in the champions league way beyond that which the brazilian achieved with werder . two draws and one win from three games may not be form to set the heart a flutter but juve sit in second place sandwiched between bayern munich in third and group leaders bordeaux .
last-placed club maccabi haifa aside , group a looks like a tough ride .
should juventus qualify , diego ’ s dream may yet live on a little longer . off in search of silver one other player who left the bundesliga with " old big ears " in mind is christoph metzelder . in the german defender 's seven year stint at borussia dortmund , a solitary bundesliga title won in his second season with the club was as good as it was ever going to get and although it may have been a surprise that he ended up at real madrid , it was no shock that metzelder decided to move on after so many barren years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzelder may have signed on to win but will he play ?
again , joining a club with the standing of real madrid certainly raised metzelder 's chances of domestic silverware – which he achieved with a spanish league title and supercup medal in his first season – but signing for the record holders for the most european cup wins must have figured in the defender 's reasoning for swapping the ruhrgebiet for the spanish capital . since leaving for madrid in 2007 , however los blancos have failed to live up to those famous sides which fill the pages of the record books .
in his first season , real were undone by as roma in the first knock-out round and were hammered at the same stage by liverpool the following year .
this year , however , despite losing to ac milan , real madrid have looked like a tasty proposition with the embarrassment of riches coach manuel pelligrini has at his disposal . this , however , may be a hindrance to metzelder personally .
while the hugely talented squad may win the 2009/10 champions league , whether metzelder plays in the team is another matter . moving to a club capable of winning the champions league is one thing .

this remains the dream of three stars who left germany in search of the big prize . whatever a player may tell you about his priorities , the champions league is the holy grail .
to hold the hugely iconic trophy known fondly as " old big ears " aloft tells the world that you have reached the pinnacle of the european game , that you have battled and beaten some of the best clubs in the world . domestic success bestows great honor on a player but being crowned european champion is not only in a different league , it ’ s in a completely different kingdom . reaching the top in your domestic league does n't always guarantee that you can make that leap to the next stage .
you can be playing for the very best , have league titles and cups threatening to collapse your trophy cabinet , and yet still have that grecian urn on steroids missing from your collection . just ask michael ballack .
in may of 2002 , a fresh-faced ballack was 90 minutes away from lifting " old big ears " as the rising star of a hugely over-achieving bayer leverkusen team .
while bayer went on to blow a league title which was theirs to lose , they were probably the best team in the bundesliga that season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's move to bayern failed to bring him the cup he covets it was with that knowledge that ballack and co. faced real madrid in the european cup final . however , a stroke of zinedine zidane genius added a dose of reality to bayer 's pretensions , snatched the title away from ballack and imploded leverkusen 's season in one fierce volley . maybe ballack left for bayern munich later that year in search of the bundesliga title that so cruelly eluded him at bayer leverkusen .
it 's more likely , however , that he joined bayern – a team that lifted the champions league trophy only a year before – because of what he saw as a better chance to win the european cup . ironically , bayer leverkusen went further in europe than bayern in ballack 's first season in bavaria , as munich failed to make it past the first group stage .
ballack got closer the following year when bayern reached the last 16 , again losing to real madrid . he went even closer in 2005 when bayern lost to chelsea in the quarter-final .
but by 2006 , when bayern started to take backwards steps in europe , it became clear that ballack had to leave if he wanted to become a european champion . to the island in joining chelsea , a team which had just secured back-to-back english premiership titles and reached european semi-finals in the previous two seasons , ballack saw a real chance to make his dream a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and chelsea were one spot-kick away from glory chelsea were on the cusp of european glory – everyone believed it was only a matter of time -lrb- not to mention money -rrb- .
in his first season with the blues , however , chelsea again stuttered at the semi-final stage .
the following year , however , presented ballack with another chance to come out on top in a final .
again , he ended up on the losing side but as it came after a cruel penalty shoot-out , an optimist could say it was closest he 'd come to date . last season , it was disappointment again at the semi-final stage as chelsea lost to eventual champions barcelona . this year , even at this early stage , chelsea again look like they will be contenders , winning three games out of three in their group stage , despite not playing their best .
ballack seems to fit into new coach carlo ancelotti 's team plan and so if things progress and chelsea advance , ballack 's move to london in search of european success may yet bear fruit . bremen to juventus but ballack is not the only star to leave the bundesliga in search of europe 's biggest prize . despite being an integral part of a werder bremen team which played exciting soccer and looked as though they had the future potential to capture silverware at home and abroad , brazilian playmaker diego left the german club for juventus in may this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's move has improved his chances of euro success becoming a serie a champion has as much cache as winning any domestic league but it remains unlikely that diego purely had designs on the scudetto when he joined the blanconeri .
diego may have increased his chances of becoming a league champion by joining juventus , with werder bremen seemingly stalled as exciting also-rans , but his chances of winning the champions league rose exponentially when he put pen to paper in turin in may . bremen had qualified for the champions league in each of the three seasons that diego featured but their shortcomings were frequently exposed .
in the three champions league campaigns of diego ’ s werder career , bremen managed to finish third in their qualifying group in the first two , dropping into the uefa cup as a result , but failed to qualify through their disappointing bundesliga placing in his final season . this year , as a juventus player , diego is performing in a team which has ambitions in the champions league way beyond that which the brazilian achieved with werder . two draws and one win from three games may not be form to set the heart a flutter but juve sit in second place sandwiched between bayern munich in third and group leaders bordeaux .
last-placed club maccabi haifa aside , group a looks like a tough ride .
should juventus qualify , diego ’ s dream may yet live on a little longer . off in search of silver one other player who left the bundesliga with " old big ears " in mind is christoph metzelder . in the german defender 's seven year stint at borussia dortmund , a solitary bundesliga title won in his second season with the club was as good as it was ever going to get and although it may have been a surprise that he ended up at real madrid , it was no shock that metzelder decided to move on after so many barren years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzelder may have signed on to win but will he play ?
again , joining a club with the standing of real madrid certainly raised metzelder 's chances of domestic silverware – which he achieved with a spanish league title and supercup medal in his first season – but signing for the record holders for the most european cup wins must have figured in the defender 's reasoning for swapping the ruhrgebiet for the spanish capital . since leaving for madrid in 2007 , however los blancos have failed to live up to those famous sides which fill the pages of the record books .
in his first season , real were undone by as roma in the first knock-out round and were hammered at the same stage by liverpool the following year .
this year , however , despite losing to ac milan , real madrid have looked like a tasty proposition with the embarrassment of riches coach manuel pelligrini has at his disposal . this , however , may be a hindrance to metzelder personally .
while the hugely talented squad may win the 2009/10 champions league , whether metzelder plays in the team is another matter . moving to a club capable of winning the champions league is one thing .

" that 's how art historian aby warburg saw himself in his own words . one of his most outstanding achievements was the founding of the warburg cultural studies library , which was officially opened in 1926 .
with four levels , the library was not exactly small , but it was designed in a space-saving manner .
narrow corridors and low doors awaited the visitors behind a red-brick facade .
the library 's infrastructure included the most modern technology of the time for transporting the books from one place to another , including special conveyor belts .
there were 26 telephone connections , a pneumatic tube , and an elevator for books and for staff .
a costly blank check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warburg was a great achiever , though plagued by mental instability warburg financed his library through his father 's banking firm , and later through that of his brother 's , who had moved to the united states .
" when aby was 13 years old , he offered me his firstborn rights , " said warburg 's brother , max .
" since he was the oldest , he was meant to go into the family business .
i was 12 at the time and agreed to buy his firstborn rights .
but he asked me to promise that i would always buy him all the books that he needed .
and , after short consideration , i agreed . "
in this way , warburg 's brother closed the deal - without realizing that this " exchange " involved writing out what was probably the most expensive blank check of his life .
behind the achievement of the library , there was a fragile human being .
with his poor health and bouts of depression , warburg from time to time underwent psychotherapy .
in 1918 , at the end of world war i , he suffered a mental breakdown - a culmination of his phobias , obsessions and delusions .
at the same time , however , he managed to gain widespread acclaim as an art historian , private scholar and researcher .
a non-traditional approach warburg was not interested in a purely aesthetic approach to art history .
his personal focus was the debate over the legacy of antiquity , which he approached with his portrayal of sandro botticelli 's works , the art of florentine painter , works by albrecht duerer and ancient pagan prophecies in written and visual representations .
" one day , i 'm sitting in the library 's lecture room with a newspaper from 1915 , " said rene drommert , a student librarian at the warburg house in the 1920s .
" suddenly , aby warburg appears and says , ' what are you doing there , mr drommert ? '
and i say : ' i 'm interested in the world war i era . '
warburg then bends over the desk and points to an advertisement offering flour and potatoes in exchange for a carpet .
and he says : ' naturally , you have the include things like this to get a good idea of the cultural and social life at the time . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for warburg , art was not just aesthetics , but the way people lived in warburg 's lifetime , the cultural studies library was considered to be an intellectual center in the weimar republic - and it remained that way till after his death on october 26 , 1929 .
many renowned scholars worked in the library 's reading room , including ernst cassirer , erwin panofsky and albert einstein .
according to charles hope , art historian and director of the warburg institute in london , what stands out is the prevalence of jewish scholars at the library .
" in my opinion , these people did not think that their jewishness had a large influence on their scholarliness , " said hope .
" their jewish background was of limited importance to them . "
second start in england this was until the rise of the nazi party threatened the library 's survival and forced it to move to london , which it did on december 12 , 1933 .
thanks to generous support on the british side , the library was preserved .
today , with 350,000 books , it is called the warburg institute and it is still one of the most significant humanities-oriented book collections in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cultural studies library is one of europe 's most important book collections the library gained its good reputation thanks to its unusual collection of books , as well as its interdisciplinary classification system , which links together very different subject areas : psychology and anthropology , theater , celebration and music , astrology and astronomy , chemistry and mathematics .
warburg himself had arranged the books in an interdisciplinary manner , and even the library 's architectural details reflected his educational motivations .
in the center was an oval reading and lecture room , because " warburg wanted an elliptical shape , as he believed that it helps people stay alert , whereas a circular room makes you sleepy , " according to hamburg art historian and warburg scholar martin warnke .
" also , it was because astronomer johannes kepler had proved that the earth and other planets followed an elliptical orbit , " said warnke .

" that 's how art historian aby warburg saw himself in his own words . one of his most outstanding achievements was the founding of the warburg cultural studies library , which was officially opened in 1926 .
with four levels , the library was not exactly small , but it was designed in a space-saving manner .
narrow corridors and low doors awaited the visitors behind a red-brick facade .
the library 's infrastructure included the most modern technology of the time for transporting the books from one place to another , including special conveyor belts .
there were 26 telephone connections , a pneumatic tube , and an elevator for books and for staff .
a costly blank check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warburg was a great achiever , though plagued by mental instability warburg financed his library through his father 's banking firm , and later through that of his brother 's , who had moved to the united states .
" when aby was 13 years old , he offered me his firstborn rights , " said warburg 's brother , max .
" since he was the oldest , he was meant to go into the family business .
i was 12 at the time and agreed to buy his firstborn rights .
but he asked me to promise that i would always buy him all the books that he needed .
and , after short consideration , i agreed . "
in this way , warburg 's brother closed the deal - without realizing that this " exchange " involved writing out what was probably the most expensive blank check of his life .
behind the achievement of the library , there was a fragile human being .
with his poor health and bouts of depression , warburg from time to time underwent psychotherapy .
in 1918 , at the end of world war i , he suffered a mental breakdown - a culmination of his phobias , obsessions and delusions .
at the same time , however , he managed to gain widespread acclaim as an art historian , private scholar and researcher .
a non-traditional approach warburg was not interested in a purely aesthetic approach to art history .
his personal focus was the debate over the legacy of antiquity , which he approached with his portrayal of sandro botticelli 's works , the art of florentine painter , works by albrecht duerer and ancient pagan prophecies in written and visual representations .
" one day , i 'm sitting in the library 's lecture room with a newspaper from 1915 , " said rene drommert , a student librarian at the warburg house in the 1920s .
" suddenly , aby warburg appears and says , ' what are you doing there , mr drommert ? '
and i say : ' i 'm interested in the world war i era . '
warburg then bends over the desk and points to an advertisement offering flour and potatoes in exchange for a carpet .
and he says : ' naturally , you have the include things like this to get a good idea of the cultural and social life at the time . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for warburg , art was not just aesthetics , but the way people lived in warburg 's lifetime , the cultural studies library was considered to be an intellectual center in the weimar republic - and it remained that way till after his death on october 26 , 1929 .
many renowned scholars worked in the library 's reading room , including ernst cassirer , erwin panofsky and albert einstein .
according to charles hope , art historian and director of the warburg institute in london , what stands out is the prevalence of jewish scholars at the library .
" in my opinion , these people did not think that their jewishness had a large influence on their scholarliness , " said hope .
" their jewish background was of limited importance to them . "
second start in england this was until the rise of the nazi party threatened the library 's survival and forced it to move to london , which it did on december 12 , 1933 .
thanks to generous support on the british side , the library was preserved .
today , with 350,000 books , it is called the warburg institute and it is still one of the most significant humanities-oriented book collections in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cultural studies library is one of europe 's most important book collections the library gained its good reputation thanks to its unusual collection of books , as well as its interdisciplinary classification system , which links together very different subject areas : psychology and anthropology , theater , celebration and music , astrology and astronomy , chemistry and mathematics .
warburg himself had arranged the books in an interdisciplinary manner , and even the library 's architectural details reflected his educational motivations .
in the center was an oval reading and lecture room , because " warburg wanted an elliptical shape , as he believed that it helps people stay alert , whereas a circular room makes you sleepy , " according to hamburg art historian and warburg scholar martin warnke .
" also , it was because astronomer johannes kepler had proved that the earth and other planets followed an elliptical orbit , " said warnke .

the reaction from all sides has been swift and not all of it is positive . a deal to reduce the period of compulsory military service in germany was worked out between chancellor angela merkel 's incoming government coalition of the conservative union parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
as of january 1 , 2011 , military service will be reduced from nine months to six .
in its election platform , the fdp had called for an abolishment of conscription , however chancellor merkel prefers to keep some form of military service .
as it now stands , young men are obliged to do a compulsory tour of duty in the german military .
they can opt out or refuse , but then must perform " civilian service , " such as working in a hospital , nursing home or other civil organization .
under the new proposal , military service will consist of three months of basic training , two months of specialized training and one month of duty in specialist service units .
the reactions to the deal have been swift and varied .
while werner hoyer , a member of the fdp , called it a reasonable compromise , johannes kahrs , a leader in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the proposal pure nonsense .
" for military service to have any value at all , it should take at least nine months , " said kahrs in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper .
spd defense expert rainer arnold said that lowering the time from nine months to six relegated military service to " an introductory course " instead of a full meal .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mutual distrust kept conscription alive one of the main reasons for conscription and maintaining an army in readiness in the past was the deep mistrust that existed between the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and west germany .
service in the military for all men over the age of 18 became compulsory in 1956 .
the option of doing civil service instead of military service was introduced in 1961 .
over the years , the amount of time one had to serve in the military has been reduced .
in the 1960s it was 18 months .
after january 2002 that number had fallen to nine months .
in the former gdr , compulsory military service was introduced in 1962 .
there are currently about 250,000 men in the german army .
of that amount , 68,270 are conscripts and of those , 25,270 are soldiers who volunteered to remain a few months longer after their mandatory service was up .
future possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association another concern of reducing military service is the concomitant effect on civil service positions that have been filled by men who chose not to serve in the military .
some have said this loss of manpower to civil organizations would be harmful .
but peter tobiassen , the head of an organization that represents conscientious objectors , has said that there are three times as many applicants for those positions than there are jobs available .
while the cdu and csu want to maintain some sort of military conscription in the future , the idea of an all-voluntary military continues to circulate .
in an interview in july , germany 's incoming foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said that while conscription had its merits , it was a thing of the past .
ulrich kirsch , the chairman of the federal armed forces association said that the german army was " open to " the idea of an all voluntary force , but more research was needed .
in any event , kirsch noted that changing to an all voluntary army would require amending the constitution , which would take a two-thirds majority , and that that was not going to happen in the near future. av / dpa / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the reaction from all sides has been swift and not all of it is positive . a deal to reduce the period of compulsory military service in germany was worked out between chancellor angela merkel 's incoming government coalition of the conservative union parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
as of january 1 , 2011 , military service will be reduced from nine months to six .
in its election platform , the fdp had called for an abolishment of conscription , however chancellor merkel prefers to keep some form of military service .
as it now stands , young men are obliged to do a compulsory tour of duty in the german military .
they can opt out or refuse , but then must perform " civilian service , " such as working in a hospital , nursing home or other civil organization .
under the new proposal , military service will consist of three months of basic training , two months of specialized training and one month of duty in specialist service units .
the reactions to the deal have been swift and varied .
while werner hoyer , a member of the fdp , called it a reasonable compromise , johannes kahrs , a leader in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the proposal pure nonsense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 24.10.2009 german parties reach coalition deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal came after marathon talks that stretched into the wee hours of saturday chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives are set to form a coalition government after sealing a deal with the free democrats .
the agreement came after the parties struck a compromise on thorny financial issues . the late-night agreement paves the way for a new center-right government to take office next week , nearly a month after merkel 's conservatives and the free democrats won a parliamentary majority in the september 27 federal election .
just hours after reaching consensus , the coalition partners announced plans to cut taxes from january 1 next year . " the burden on families has to be lessened , the burden on companies and inheritance tax has to be reformed , " chancellor merkel said during a press conference in berlin on saturday . " we are aiming for growth , " she said , adding that the new government would focus on education and social cohesion .
" we have agreed a coalition program showing that we want to advance courageously into the future . " at the joint news conference with merkel , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , described the coalition agreement as " a great compass for our country . " sharing key cabinet posts the parties divided up key cabinet posts , with current interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the cdu being chosen to head the finance ministry , while the fdp 's westerwelle is to become foreign minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has earned a reputation as a hardliner when it comes to security policy the 67-year-old schaeuble , who has been bound to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 and has the reputation of being a hardliner on domestic security policy , was a surprise choice for the post of finance minister .
ahead of the september election , he indirectly criticized merkel 's pledge to pursue billions of euros in tax cuts , saying there was little room for them given germany 's strained finances .
now schaeuble will be charged with implementing those cuts against the backdrop of a deficit that is poised to rise to double european union limits next year .
news of his likely appointment sparked mixed reactions in germany on friday .
“ he 's an unknown entity when it comes to financial issues , " dennis snower , head of the kiel-based institute for economic research , told the reuters news agency .
" you ca n't make any predictions about his future financial policy based on what he 's done so far . "
" i think he 's a tough cookie and this is what will be needed , " carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing financial markets said .
" he is someone who would not be afraid of ruining his public image due to unpopular decision-making . "
thomas de maiziere , merkel 's trusted lieutenant as chief of staff , is set to take over schaeble 's job at the interior ministry .
free democrats bag prominent posts as widely expected , the post of foreign minister goes to fdp leader guido westerwelle .
the 47-year-old is the first openly gay leader of a mainstream political party in germany .
he has no foreign policy or government experience .
rainer bruederle , the fdp 's economics spokesman in the parliament for a decade , is set to replace karl-theodor zu guttenberg as economy minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the asian-born free democrat is a surprise pick the media-savvy guttenberg is set to head the defense ministry .
the 37-year-old , who is a member of the csu party , will be in charge of tackling the afghanistan mission which is deeply unpopular in germany .
the free democrats ' phillip roesler is a surprise pick for the post of health minister .
the 36-year-old , a rising star in the fdp , is currently the economy minister in the state of lower saxony and is reported to have led coalition negotiations on healthcare .
born in vietnam , roesler will germany 's first asian-born cabinet minister , also replacing guttenberg as the youngest member of the cabinet .
compromise on tax cuts the deal over the new government came after the conservative bloc and the free democrats managed to reconcile their promise of billions of euros in tax cuts with a separate pledge to get germany 's deficit – swollen by massive stimulus packages – back under control .
horst seehofer , head of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , admitted the final round of negotiations had been bogged down by financial issues .
" the financial issues at the end are always the most difficult and most exciting and you have to do that with great care , " he said , explaining why the talks stretched into the night .
" but it all worked out in the end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer -lrb- r -rrb- admitted that the final round of coalition talks was tough to spur growth , the alliance plans to cut income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- between 2011 and 2013 , according to seehofer .
that is more than the 20 billion euros merkel wanted but far less than 35 billion euros the fdp sought .
" that number is right – even if you did n't hear it from me first , " seehofer said .
" i 'm very pleased with this result , " he added , referring to the coalition agreement after the protracted talks .

the agreement came after the parties struck a compromise on thorny financial issues . the late-night agreement paves the way for a new center-right government to take office next week , nearly a month after merkel 's conservatives and the free democrats won a parliamentary majority in the september 27 federal election .
just hours after reaching consensus , the coalition partners announced plans to cut taxes from january 1 next year . " the burden on families has to be lessened , the burden on companies and inheritance tax has to be reformed , " chancellor merkel said during a press conference in berlin on saturday . " we are aiming for growth , " she said , adding that the new government would focus on education and social cohesion .
" we have agreed a coalition program showing that we want to advance courageously into the future . " at the joint news conference with merkel , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , described the coalition agreement as " a great compass for our country . " sharing key cabinet posts the parties divided up key cabinet posts , with current interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the cdu being chosen to head the finance ministry , while the fdp 's westerwelle is to become foreign minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has earned a reputation as a hardliner when it comes to security policy the 67-year-old schaeuble , who has been bound to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 and has the reputation of being a hardliner on domestic security policy , was a surprise choice for the post of finance minister .
ahead of the september election , he indirectly criticized merkel 's pledge to pursue billions of euros in tax cuts , saying there was little room for them given germany 's strained finances .
now schaeuble will be charged with implementing those cuts against the backdrop of a deficit that is poised to rise to double european union limits next year .
news of his likely appointment sparked mixed reactions in germany on friday .
“ he 's an unknown entity when it comes to financial issues , " dennis snower , head of the kiel-based institute for economic research , told the reuters news agency .
" you ca n't make any predictions about his future financial policy based on what he 's done so far . "
" i think he 's a tough cookie and this is what will be needed , " carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing financial markets said .
" he is someone who would not be afraid of ruining his public image due to unpopular decision-making . "
thomas de maiziere , merkel 's trusted lieutenant as chief of staff , is set to take over schaeble 's job at the interior ministry .
free democrats bag prominent posts as widely expected , the post of foreign minister goes to fdp leader guido westerwelle .
the 47-year-old is the first openly gay leader of a mainstream political party in germany .
he has no foreign policy or government experience .

a poll conducted by yougov for the daily telegraph newspaper released on saturday shows that 22 percent of britons would " seriously consider " voting bnp in a future local , general or european election .
according to the website of the daily telegraph newspaper , this included four percent who said they would " definitely " consider voting for the party , three percent who would " probably " consider it , and 15 percent who said they were " possible " bnp voters .
two-thirds of those polled said they would not consider voting for the party " under any circumstances , " while the rest were undecided .
more than half of those surveyed agreed with the bnp or thought the party " had a point " in wishing to " speak up for the interests of the indigenous , white british people ... which successive governments have done far too little to protect . "
griffin , who was a guest on bbc 's " question time , " was asked about his views on the holocaust , immigration , islam and homosexuality by a panel and members of the audience .
he has accused the broadcaster of setting a lynch mob on him in a controversial edition of the show , which was watched by a record 8.2 million people – almost three times the average number of viewers .
he demanded that the bbc give him a " second chance " to get his views across , and insisted that " the british people are aghast at the display of bias from the bbc . "

in an interview with london 's evening standard newspaper on friday , le pen suggested that the bnp would receive a boost from the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demonstrated outside bbc studios on the day of show " small fish will become big so long as god gives them life .

straw said the program had been " catastrophic " for griffin who had been " exposed as a fantasizing conspiracy theorist with some very unpleasant views and no moral compass . "
cabinet minister peter hain , a veteran anti-apartheid campaigner who fought unsuccessfully to try to stop griffin 's appearance , said : " this is exactly what i feared and warned about . " the bbc has handed the bnp the gift of the century on a plate and now we see the consequences , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 24.10.2009 czech nod raises new hope for eu treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorny obstacles have delayed the treaty and the creation of a new european commission the european union 's lisbon treaty looks set to emerge from a limbo as the last hurdle to its ratification , czech president vaclav klaus , accepted a concession offered by the 27-nation bloc . vaclav klaus is the last eu leader holding out on signing the treaty , which aims to streamline eu decision-making and must be ratified by all members to take effect .
on friday , the staunch eurosceptic accepted a proposal by the swedish eu presidency to handle an opt-out from the treaty which he demands .
" this proposal corresponds to the president 's expectations and he can continue to work with it , " said klaus 's office .
critics of the czech president regard the demand as another attempt to delay the ratification .
however , friday 's statement by klaus 's office is the second glimmer of hope for the eu in a week , after the president suggested just days ago that he would ultimately sign .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , no matter how much some of us would want that , " he said last saturday , fueling hopes that the treaty might take effect soon .
exemption clause on property two weeks ago , klaus asked for an exemption from the treaty that would prevent ethnic germans forced out of his country after world war ii from reclaiming their property .
britain and poland won similar exemptions during the treaty negotiations in 2007 – catholic poland was assured it would not be forced to allow gay marriages , and britain promised that eu laws and courts would not prevail over its own judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso is unable to set up a new commission due to delays to the lisbon treaty stefan fule , czech minister for eu affairs , said the czech exemption would be a general one , comprising a comma and the words " czech republic " attached to " great britain " and " poland " in the treaty 's protocol .
recognizing that the chances that klaus might yield were slim , sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the czech cabinet set out to work on the wording of the exemption , which they hope to submit to the eu for approval at a summit next week .
european commission held up the eu has been waiting in suspense for klaus ' signature , the last step in the czech ratification process after local lawmakers approved the treaty earlier this year .
the impasse means that european commission chief jose manuel barroso , who was last month granted a second five-year term , is unable to nominate a new commission , because it is unclear what legal basis he should use .
the mandate of the current commission – the eu 's executive arm – expires at the end of october .
the body that draws up legislation impacting the lives of about half a billion europeans and policing the application of eu laws is likely to remain a lame duck until the future becomes clearer .
this may take some time as klaus has also linked his signature to a go-ahead from the top czech court , which is currently assessing the treaty 's compliance with the country 's constitution following a complaint filed by a group of eurosceptic senators .
like president klaus , the senators fear the treaty will give too much power to brussels and threaten czech sovereignty .
the court has said it will discuss the complaint in a public hearing on tuesday , but it is unclear how long the process might take .
concerns over further hurdles the president of the european parliament , jerzy buzek , said on friday he expected the lisbon reform treaty to come into force before the end of the year while admitting that challenges persisted .
" it 's my personal opinion : i can say that it 's a very high probability that we will have our lisbon treaty in place at the end of this year , " he said in an interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus recently conceded that the lisbon treaty is inevitable however , buzek voiced concerns an opt-out deal with the czechs could " bring problems in other member states " .
" we would like to have a solution proper for the czech republic and for president klaus to sign the lisbon treaty .
but of course we would n't like to have problems in other member states , " he said .
concerns that more countries may try to negotiate footnotes to the charter intensified last week after slovak prime minister robert fico said he may ask for an opt-out clause for his country if the czechs succeed. rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 24.10.2009 czech nod raises new hope for eu treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorny obstacles have delayed the treaty and the creation of a new european commission the european union 's lisbon treaty looks set to emerge from a limbo as the last hurdle to its ratification , czech president vaclav klaus , accepted a concession offered by the 27-nation bloc . vaclav klaus is the last eu leader holding out on signing the treaty , which aims to streamline eu decision-making and must be ratified by all members to take effect .
on friday , the staunch eurosceptic accepted a proposal by the swedish eu presidency to handle an opt-out from the treaty which he demands .
" this proposal corresponds to the president 's expectations and he can continue to work with it , " said klaus 's office .
critics of the czech president regard the demand as another attempt to delay the ratification .
however , friday 's statement by klaus 's office is the second glimmer of hope for the eu in a week , after the president suggested just days ago that he would ultimately sign .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , no matter how much some of us would want that , " he said last saturday , fueling hopes that the treaty might take effect soon .
exemption clause on property two weeks ago , klaus asked for an exemption from the treaty that would prevent ethnic germans forced out of his country after world war ii from reclaiming their property .
britain and poland won similar exemptions during the treaty negotiations in 2007 – catholic poland was assured it would not be forced to allow gay marriages , and britain promised that eu laws and courts would not prevail over its own judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso is unable to set up a new commission due to delays to the lisbon treaty stefan fule , czech minister for eu affairs , said the czech exemption would be a general one , comprising a comma and the words " czech republic " attached to " great britain " and " poland " in the treaty 's protocol .
recognizing that the chances that klaus might yield were slim , sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the czech cabinet set out to work on the wording of the exemption , which they hope to submit to the eu for approval at a summit next week .
european commission held up the eu has been waiting in suspense for klaus ' signature , the last step in the czech ratification process after local lawmakers approved the treaty earlier this year .
the impasse means that european commission chief jose manuel barroso , who was last month granted a second five-year term , is unable to nominate a new commission , because it is unclear what legal basis he should use .
the mandate of the current commission – the eu 's executive arm – expires at the end of october .
the body that draws up legislation impacting the lives of about half a billion europeans and policing the application of eu laws is likely to remain a lame duck until the future becomes clearer .
this may take some time as klaus has also linked his signature to a go-ahead from the top czech court , which is currently assessing the treaty 's compliance with the country 's constitution following a complaint filed by a group of eurosceptic senators .
like president klaus , the senators fear the treaty will give too much power to brussels and threaten czech sovereignty .
the court has said it will discuss the complaint in a public hearing on tuesday , but it is unclear how long the process might take .
concerns over further hurdles the president of the european parliament , jerzy buzek , said on friday he expected the lisbon reform treaty to come into force before the end of the year while admitting that challenges persisted .
" it 's my personal opinion : i can say that it 's a very high probability that we will have our lisbon treaty in place at the end of this year , " he said in an interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus recently conceded that the lisbon treaty is inevitable however , buzek voiced concerns an opt-out deal with the czechs could " bring problems in other member states " .
" we would like to have a solution proper for the czech republic and for president klaus to sign the lisbon treaty .
but of course we would n't like to have problems in other member states , " he said .
concerns that more countries may try to negotiate footnotes to the charter intensified last week after slovak prime minister robert fico said he may ask for an opt-out clause for his country if the czechs succeed. rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with no ministerial or foreign affairs experience , what does he bring to the table ? guido westerwelle , 47 , led the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to their best-ever result in the september 27 election , with the party taking just under 15 percent of the vote .
that ended an 11-year spell in opposition for the fdp and paved the way for it to become the junior coalition partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
it has also handed westerwelle a chance to move on from his role as leader of the opposition and on to greener pastures .
the roles of foreign minister and vice-chancellor are traditionally awarded to the leader of the junior party in federal coalition governments .
westerwelle assumes these positions from social democrat frank-walter steinmeier , who was also the spd 's chancellor candidate in the recent election .
political freshman but with only experience outside of government , and a political career that has barely , if ever , involved foreign relations , some are asking what westerwelle can bring to the position .
he has little direct experience of foreign policy but has recently made some visits abroad , including to russia .
his party is pro-american and westerwelle is not expected to deviate from the approach of his predecessors , nor from the " basic tenets " of post-war german foreign policy .
on saturday , oct .
24 , westerwelle said nuclear non-proliferation and the removal of us atomic warheads from german soil would be a priority for his ministry .
merkel has said this would be achieved through dialog with germany 's partners in the nato forum .
westerwelle is also known to be a supporter of stronger trans-atlantic ties , and is a member of the non-partisan atlantik bruecke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization , dedicated to achieving this goal .
but that wo n't necessarily mean that germany will give in to us wishes to commit more troops to afghanistan .
while westerwelle has been vague on many foreign-policy points , he has stated clearly his aversion to any expansion in german army operations under nato .
questions over effectiveness but westerwelle is bound to make waves for being europe 's first openly gay foreign minister , having publicly " come out " at merkel 's 50th birthday party .
the trained lawyer has dismissed any notion that this could pose problems in his role as foreign minister .
" some other countries may have had a problem with the fact that angela merkel became the first female chancellor of germany .
of course she does not wear a veil on the red carpet when she visits certain arab states , " he has been quoted as saying .
" the decision as to whom we send as a government representative rests solely with us germans , based on our political and moral standards . "

westerwelle 's seeming reluctance to speak english has raised some questions about his suitability for the post of germany 's top diplomat .
westerwelle declined to answer a question in english that had been put to him by a bbc reporter during his first news conference after last month 's elections . " in great britain it is expected that people speak english , and it is the same in germany - people are expected to speak german , " westerwelle said at the time , prompting heated debate on the internet .
on the domestic front , the thorniest issue for westerwelle has been over tax cuts .
the free democrats had promised voters 35 billion euros worth of cuts in the recent election , but merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wanted only 15 billion euros .

but with no ministerial or foreign affairs experience , what does he bring to the table ? guido westerwelle , 47 , led the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to their best-ever result in the september 27 election , with the party taking just under 15 percent of the vote .
that ended an 11-year spell in opposition for the fdp and paved the way for it to become the junior coalition partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
it has also handed westerwelle a chance to move on from his role as leader of the opposition and on to greener pastures .
the roles of foreign minister and vice-chancellor are traditionally awarded to the leader of the junior party in federal coalition governments .
westerwelle assumes these positions from social democrat frank-walter steinmeier , who was also the spd 's chancellor candidate in the recent election .
political freshman but with only experience outside of government , and a political career that has barely , if ever , involved foreign relations , some are asking what westerwelle can bring to the position .
he has little direct experience of foreign policy but has recently made some visits abroad , including to russia .
his party is pro-american and westerwelle is not expected to deviate from the approach of his predecessors , nor from the " basic tenets " of post-war german foreign policy .
on saturday , oct .
24 , westerwelle said nuclear non-proliferation and the removal of us atomic warheads from german soil would be a priority for his ministry .
merkel has said this would be achieved through dialog with germany 's partners in the nato forum .
westerwelle is also known to be a supporter of stronger trans-atlantic ties , and is a member of the non-partisan atlantik bruecke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization , dedicated to achieving this goal .
but that wo n't necessarily mean that germany will give in to us wishes to commit more troops to afghanistan .
while westerwelle has been vague on many foreign-policy points , he has stated clearly his aversion to any expansion in german army operations under nato .
questions over effectiveness but westerwelle is bound to make waves for being europe 's first openly gay foreign minister , having publicly " come out " at merkel 's 50th birthday party .
the trained lawyer has dismissed any notion that this could pose problems in his role as foreign minister .
" some other countries may have had a problem with the fact that angela merkel became the first female chancellor of germany .
of course she does not wear a veil on the red carpet when she visits certain arab states , " he has been quoted as saying .
" the decision as to whom we send as a government representative rests solely with us germans , based on our political and moral standards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle introduced his partner michael mronz , right , some five years ago born in bad honnef , near bonn in western germany , westerwelle was elected to the german parliament in 1996 and became head of the fdp in 2001 .
westerwelle 's seeming reluctance to speak english has raised some questions about his suitability for the post of germany 's top diplomat .
westerwelle declined to answer a question in english that had been put to him by a bbc reporter during his first news conference after last month 's elections . " in great britain it is expected that people speak english , and it is the same in germany - people are expected to speak german , " westerwelle said at the time , prompting heated debate on the internet .
on the domestic front , the thorniest issue for westerwelle has been over tax cuts .
the free democrats had promised voters 35 billion euros worth of cuts in the recent election , but merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wanted only 15 billion euros .
on saturday , the coalition partners put this issue to bed , agreeing on 24 billion euros in cuts. dfm / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the reaction from all sides has been swift and not all of it is positive . a deal to reduce the period of compulsory military service in germany was worked out between chancellor angela merkel 's incoming government coalition of the conservative union parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
as of january 1 , 2011 , military service will be reduced from nine months to six .
in its election platform , the fdp had called for an abolishment of conscription , however chancellor merkel prefers to keep some form of military service .
as it now stands , young men are obliged to do a compulsory tour of duty in the german military .
they can opt out or refuse , but then must perform " civilian service , " such as working in a hospital , nursing home or other civil organization .
under the new proposal , military service will consist of three months of basic training , two months of specialized training and one month of duty in specialist service units .
the reactions to the deal have been swift and varied .
while werner hoyer , a member of the fdp , called it a reasonable compromise , johannes kahrs , a leader in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the proposal pure nonsense .
" for military service to have any value at all , it should take at least nine months , " said kahrs in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper .
spd defense expert rainer arnold said that lowering the time from nine months to six relegated military service to " an introductory course " instead of a full meal .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mutual distrust kept conscription alive one of the main reasons for conscription and maintaining an army in readiness in the past was the deep mistrust that existed between the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and west germany .
service in the military for all men over the age of 18 became compulsory in 1956 .
the option of doing civil service instead of military service was introduced in 1961 .
over the years , the amount of time one had to serve in the military has been reduced .
in the 1960s it was 18 months .
after january 2002 that number had fallen to nine months .
in the former gdr , compulsory military service was introduced in 1962 .
there are currently about 250,000 men in the german army .
of that amount , 68,270 are conscripts and of those , 25,270 are soldiers who volunteered to remain a few months longer after their mandatory service was up .
future possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association another concern of reducing military service is the concomitant effect on civil service positions that have been filled by men who chose not to serve in the military .
some have said this loss of manpower to civil organizations would be harmful .
but peter tobiassen , the head of an organization that represents conscientious objectors , has said that there are three times as many applicants for those positions than there are jobs available .
while the cdu and csu want to maintain some sort of military conscription in the future , the idea of an all-voluntary military continues to circulate .
in an interview in july , germany 's incoming foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said that while conscription had its merits , it was a thing of the past .
ulrich kirsch , the chairman of the federal armed forces association said that the german army was " open to " the idea of an all voluntary force , but more research was needed .
in any event , kirsch noted that changing to an all voluntary army would require amending the constitution , which would take a two-thirds majority , and that that was not going to happen in the near future. av / dpa / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's sparked mixed reactions in germany . the agreement , finalized in the early hours of saturday morning , come three weeks of bargaining and almost a month after merkel 's conservatives and the fdp won a parliamentary majority in federal elections .
the new coalition will look to extend the lifespans of nuclear power plants it judges safe , change banking supervision rules to give the bundesbank greater powers and ensure continuity in foreign policy , according to the 128-page coalition agreement .
the centerpiece of the agreement is a plan to slash income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- , in particular reducing the tax burden on families with children and reforms to corporate and inheritance tax .
the plans have met with praise from industry leaders but germany 's political opposition and environmental groups have slammed them as unrealistic and damaging .
steinmeier : " false start " the leading opposition party social democrats has slammed the coalition deal as a shift in the wrong direction .
the social democrats were part of an uneasy " grand coalition " with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives for the last four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier warns of a widening gap between rich and poor outgoing foreign minister and head of the social democrats ' parliamentary group , frank-walter steinmeier described the deal as a " grand false start . "
steinmeier ran as merkel 's main challenger in the bid for the chancellery .
" nothing will get better , but there will be less security and things will get a lot more expensive .
this coalition will widen the social divisions in this country instead of fighting them , " steinmeier told newspaper bild am sonntag . the head of the social democrats , siegmar gabriel criticized the coalition for embarking on a course against the common good with an unrealistic financial plan . several economists too have expressed scepticism about how the new government would finance its tax plans in light of the country 's ballooning deficit as germany struggles with its most severe recession since world war ii . the left party accused the incoming government of failing to handle the costs of the economic crisis in a fair way .
party chief gregor gysi said berlin was about to embark on a path of " privatizing social risks , " with the majority shouldering the costs of the mistakes made by a few .
criticism over pro-nuclear policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shut down those nuclear power plants , says roth the opposition green party has accused the incoming government of endangering social peace in germany . " in terms of environment , transport , energy , and climate protections , the coalition agreement is a worst case scenario , " the greens ' chief claudia roth said on saturday .
environment groups have equally condemned the deal which abandons earlier plans for germany to scrap nuclear power by the year 2020 .
greenpeace described the coalition 's plans as a " clear failure when it comes to protecting the environment . "
allowing a longer life span to older nuclear plants is a " fatal sign " according to greenpeace .
berlin 's decision to back genetically modified crops has also sparked an outcry among environmentalists .
applause from industry and employers german business and industry however , have applauded the new deal as a step in the right direction to help germany fight its way out of the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundt , representing german employers , says the deal is a good compass the head of the confederation of german employers associations , dieter hundt , described it as a " good compass for the coming years , " criticizing only that the coalition did n't go far enough in making employment regulations more flexible .
hans-peter keil , president of the federation of german industries , said the deal was going into the right direction but expressed disappointment that there had n't been enough courage to push through further reforms .
especially research and innovation should have received more support , he said .

this remains the dream of three stars who left germany in search of the big prize . whatever a player may tell you about his priorities , the champions league is the holy grail .
to hold the hugely iconic trophy known fondly as " old big ears " aloft tells the world that you have reached the pinnacle of the european game , that you have battled and beaten some of the best clubs in the world . domestic success bestows great honor on a player but being crowned european champion is not only in a different league , it ’ s in a completely different kingdom . reaching the top in your domestic league does n't always guarantee that you can make that leap to the next stage .
you can be playing for the very best , have league titles and cups threatening to collapse your trophy cabinet , and yet still have that grecian urn on steroids missing from your collection . just ask michael ballack .
in may of 2002 , a fresh-faced ballack was 90 minutes away from lifting " old big ears " as the rising star of a hugely over-achieving bayer leverkusen team .
while bayer went on to blow a league title which was theirs to lose , they were probably the best team in the bundesliga that season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's move to bayern failed to bring him the cup he covets it was with that knowledge that ballack and co. faced real madrid in the european cup final . however , a stroke of zinedine zidane genius added a dose of reality to bayer 's pretensions , snatched the title away from ballack and imploded leverkusen 's season in one fierce volley . maybe ballack left for bayern munich later that year in search of the bundesliga title that so cruelly eluded him at bayer leverkusen .
it 's more likely , however , that he joined bayern – a team that lifted the champions league trophy only a year before – because of what he saw as a better chance to win the european cup . ironically , bayer leverkusen went further in europe than bayern in ballack 's first season in bavaria , as munich failed to make it past the first group stage .
ballack got closer the following year when bayern reached the last 16 , again losing to real madrid . he went even closer in 2005 when bayern lost to chelsea in the quarter-final .
but by 2006 , when bayern started to take backwards steps in europe , it became clear that ballack had to leave if he wanted to become a european champion . to the island in joining chelsea , a team which had just secured back-to-back english premiership titles and reached european semi-finals in the previous two seasons , ballack saw a real chance to make his dream a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and chelsea were one spot-kick away from glory chelsea were on the cusp of european glory – everyone believed it was only a matter of time -lrb- not to mention money -rrb- .
in his first season with the blues , however , chelsea again stuttered at the semi-final stage .
the following year , however , presented ballack with another chance to come out on top in a final .
again , he ended up on the losing side but as it came after a cruel penalty shoot-out , an optimist could say it was closest he 'd come to date . last season , it was disappointment again at the semi-final stage as chelsea lost to eventual champions barcelona . this year , even at this early stage , chelsea again look like they will be contenders , winning three games out of three in their group stage , despite not playing their best .
ballack seems to fit into new coach carlo ancelotti 's team plan and so if things progress and chelsea advance , ballack 's move to london in search of european success may yet bear fruit . bremen to juventus but ballack is not the only star to leave the bundesliga in search of europe 's biggest prize . despite being an integral part of a werder bremen team which played exciting soccer and looked as though they had the future potential to capture silverware at home and abroad , brazilian playmaker diego left the german club for juventus in may this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's move has improved his chances of euro success becoming a serie a champion has as much cache as winning any domestic league but it remains unlikely that diego purely had designs on the scudetto when he joined the blanconeri .
diego may have increased his chances of becoming a league champion by joining juventus , with werder bremen seemingly stalled as exciting also-rans , but his chances of winning the champions league rose exponentially when he put pen to paper in turin in may . bremen had qualified for the champions league in each of the three seasons that diego featured but their shortcomings were frequently exposed .
in the three champions league campaigns of diego ’ s werder career , bremen managed to finish third in their qualifying group in the first two , dropping into the uefa cup as a result , but failed to qualify through their disappointing bundesliga placing in his final season . this year , as a juventus player , diego is performing in a team which has ambitions in the champions league way beyond that which the brazilian achieved with werder . two draws and one win from three games may not be form to set the heart a flutter but juve sit in second place sandwiched between bayern munich in third and group leaders bordeaux .
last-placed club maccabi haifa aside , group a looks like a tough ride .
should juventus qualify , diego ’ s dream may yet live on a little longer . off in search of silver one other player who left the bundesliga with " old big ears " in mind is christoph metzelder . in the german defender 's seven year stint at borussia dortmund , a solitary bundesliga title won in his second season with the club was as good as it was ever going to get and although it may have been a surprise that he ended up at real madrid , it was no shock that metzelder decided to move on after so many barren years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzelder may have signed on to win but will he play ?
again , joining a club with the standing of real madrid certainly raised metzelder 's chances of domestic silverware – which he achieved with a spanish league title and supercup medal in his first season – but signing for the record holders for the most european cup wins must have figured in the defender 's reasoning for swapping the ruhrgebiet for the spanish capital . since leaving for madrid in 2007 , however los blancos have failed to live up to those famous sides which fill the pages of the record books .
in his first season , real were undone by as roma in the first knock-out round and were hammered at the same stage by liverpool the following year .
this year , however , despite losing to ac milan , real madrid have looked like a tasty proposition with the embarrassment of riches coach manuel pelligrini has at his disposal . this , however , may be a hindrance to metzelder personally .
while the hugely talented squad may win the 2009/10 champions league , whether metzelder plays in the team is another matter . moving to a club capable of winning the champions league is one thing .
actually playing for that team is another . author : nick amies editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the agreement came after the parties struck a compromise on thorny financial issues . the late-night agreement paves the way for a new center-right government to take office next week , nearly a month after merkel 's conservatives and the free democrats won a parliamentary majority in the september 27 federal election .
just hours after reaching consensus , the coalition partners announced plans to cut taxes from january 1 next year . " the burden on families has to be lessened , the burden on companies and inheritance tax has to be reformed , " chancellor merkel said during a press conference in berlin on saturday . " we are aiming for growth , " she said , adding that the new government would focus on education and social cohesion .
" we have agreed a coalition program showing that we want to advance courageously into the future . " at the joint news conference with merkel , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , described the coalition agreement as " a great compass for our country . " sharing key cabinet posts the parties divided up key cabinet posts , with current interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the cdu being chosen to head the finance ministry , while the fdp 's westerwelle is to become foreign minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has earned a reputation as a hardliner when it comes to security policy the 67-year-old schaeuble , who has been bound to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 and has the reputation of being a hardliner on domestic security policy , was a surprise choice for the post of finance minister .
ahead of the september election , he indirectly criticized merkel 's pledge to pursue billions of euros in tax cuts , saying there was little room for them given germany 's strained finances .
now schaeuble will be charged with implementing those cuts against the backdrop of a deficit that is poised to rise to double european union limits next year .
news of his likely appointment sparked mixed reactions in germany on friday .
“ he 's an unknown entity when it comes to financial issues , " dennis snower , head of the kiel-based institute for economic research , told the reuters news agency .
" you ca n't make any predictions about his future financial policy based on what he 's done so far . "
" i think he 's a tough cookie and this is what will be needed , " carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing financial markets said .
" he is someone who would not be afraid of ruining his public image due to unpopular decision-making . "
thomas de maiziere , merkel 's trusted lieutenant as chief of staff , is set to take over schaeble 's job at the interior ministry .
free democrats bag prominent posts as widely expected , the post of foreign minister goes to fdp leader guido westerwelle .
the 47-year-old is the first openly gay leader of a mainstream political party in germany .
he has no foreign policy or government experience .
rainer bruederle , the fdp 's economics spokesman in the parliament for a decade , is set to replace karl-theodor zu guttenberg as economy minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the asian-born free democrat is a surprise pick the media-savvy guttenberg is set to head the defense ministry .
the 37-year-old , who is a member of the csu party , will be in charge of tackling the afghanistan mission which is deeply unpopular in germany .
the free democrats ' phillip roesler is a surprise pick for the post of health minister .
the 36-year-old , a rising star in the fdp , is currently the economy minister in the state of lower saxony and is reported to have led coalition negotiations on healthcare .
born in vietnam , roesler will germany 's first asian-born cabinet minister , also replacing guttenberg as the youngest member of the cabinet .
compromise on tax cuts the deal over the new government came after the conservative bloc and the free democrats managed to reconcile their promise of billions of euros in tax cuts with a separate pledge to get germany 's deficit – swollen by massive stimulus packages – back under control .
horst seehofer , head of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , admitted the final round of negotiations had been bogged down by financial issues .
" the financial issues at the end are always the most difficult and most exciting and you have to do that with great care , " he said , explaining why the talks stretched into the night .
" but it all worked out in the end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer -lrb- r -rrb- admitted that the final round of coalition talks was tough to spur growth , the alliance plans to cut income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- between 2011 and 2013 , according to seehofer .
that is more than the 20 billion euros merkel wanted but far less than 35 billion euros the fdp sought .
" that number is right – even if you did n't hear it from me first , " seehofer said .
" i 'm very pleased with this result , " he added , referring to the coalition agreement after the protracted talks .
" we 've come up with a reasonable plan for the next four years and the coalition has set up a good platform for economic recovery in germany . " rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

indeed the existence of german mercenaries is a claim that many civilians would be quick to refute , insisting instead that private military companies are the preserve of the americans . but , franz hutsch , ex-officer , war reporter and author of a new book on the growing numbers of german mercenaries says such thinking is downright wrong .
granted , it is us companies such as blackwater - which changed its name to xe in light of the cia disclosure - that frequently make headline news , but they do not only recruit from among their own , and they are not one of a kind . " there are several private military companies beginning to establish themselves in germany , " hutsch told deutsche welle , adding that even without them , willing germans have ample opportunity to become part of the private military apparatus at work in conflict regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blackwater does not only recruit americans " in spring 2009 , both blackwater and dyncorp ran what you could describe as casting shows in southern germany in order to recruit german soldiers of fortune , " hutsch explained .
their image and details of their capabilities are then kept on file so they can be deployed on a mission by mission basis . good training required one private military outfit in germany , praetoria , requires its applicants to have spent at least six years in a nato or western army or in a police force and to have been engaged in active service in a crisis zone abroad . in other words , in order to work for praetoria , applicants need to have been trained by reputable armed forces .
and therein , as far as franz hutsch is concerned , lies a big problem . " i object to the fact that the know-how soldiers have acquired from the german armed forces -lrb- bundeswehr -rrb- might later be used against the bundeswehr or against nato , " he said , citing the possibility of future wars in which german mercenaries are paid to shoot their former comrades . but the spokesman for the bundeswehr association , wilfried stolze , dismisses the suggestion out of hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experience abroad is a hot commodity among recruiters " unimaginable science fiction , " he told deutsche welle .
" we know there are mercenaries in other countries , but it is not something we are familiar with in germany . " preatoria spokesman marc tuernau , however , said his outfit receives applications from germans looking to get on to their files " on a fairly regular basis . " not a new phenomenon hutsch , who spent months in the company of mercenaries in the course of researching his book , says german mercenaries have been part of the military landscape since the bosnian war .
it is only now , however , that the secrecy in which they have long been shrouded , is beginning to fray around the edges . that , from the author 's point of view , is a good thing .
he says the very principle of soldiers of fortune is cockeyed .
" they arrive in a warzone and are supposed to put an end to the hostilities , but they love war because they live from it , so they do n't want it to stop . " and that living can amount to quite something .
us congress findings from last year revealed that western european mercenaries can expect to earn as much as $ 1,357 -lrb- 954 euros -rrb- each day . so what exactly do they have to do for their money ?
praetoria says the task list of their recruits is long and varied , ranging from personal and building protection to administrative and reconstruction work . but can those engaged in reconstruction - albeit through a private military firm - be referred to as mercenaries ?
hutsch says it amounts to semantics .
citing a study by ulrich petersohn for the german institute for international and security affairs , he said the german government has outsourced many tasks which would once have been done by soldiers to what it calls ' contractors ' . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many guns are put into contractors ' hands ?
" afghan militiamen armed with kalashnikovs guard camps of german soldiers , " he said , adding that logistics crews take care of vehicle repairs and cooking in a bid to free up the inadequate number of german troops to patrol and fight . a step in the wrong direction ? when asked to comment on the nature and extent of work done by ' contractors ' , the minsitry of defense in berlin said it does not collect or keep on file any information regarding the engagement of private security enterprises .
yet wilfried stolze says the bundeswehr has certainly been known to hire local people to take on non-combative work , paid for " out of the ministry of defense budget . "
he stressed that it was a good thing , as it enabled indigenous populations to earn some money . franz hutsch , however , says it is anything but a good thing .
he describes it as a step toward " close cooperation " with mercenaries and a step which could lead to situations 10 to 15 years from now in which smaller conflicts are fought out entirely by soldiers of fortune . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the body of a german soldier arrives back on home ground " mercenaries are always used to keep a war out of the public eye , " the writer said .
" a soldier in afghanistan comes home with a flag on his coffin whereas a mercenary who dies , does n't even get a mention . " whatever the nametag reads , there is no denying that private capabilities are a part of contemporary combat .
and that , stresses hutsch , has to be regulated . " we need tighter control over private military companies , " he said , " and greater parliamentary supervision over defense spending in order to see where mercenaries are being used . " franz hutsch 's book " exportschlager tod " is published by econ . author : tamsin walker editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 24.10.2009 new german government to shorten military conscription großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandatory service to be reduced germany 's new coalition government plans to reduce the time that young men must serve in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr .
the reaction from all sides has been swift and not all of it is positive . a deal to reduce the period of compulsory military service in germany was worked out between chancellor angela merkel 's incoming government coalition of the conservative union parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
as of january 1 , 2011 , military service will be reduced from nine months to six .
in its election platform , the fdp had called for an abolishment of conscription , however chancellor merkel prefers to keep some form of military service .
as it now stands , young men are obliged to do a compulsory tour of duty in the german military .
they can opt out or refuse , but then must perform " civilian service , " such as working in a hospital , nursing home or other civil organization .
under the new proposal , military service will consist of three months of basic training , two months of specialized training and one month of duty in specialist service units .
the reactions to the deal have been swift and varied .
while werner hoyer , a member of the fdp , called it a reasonable compromise , johannes kahrs , a leader in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the proposal pure nonsense .
" for military service to have any value at all , it should take at least nine months , " said kahrs in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper .
spd defense expert rainer arnold said that lowering the time from nine months to six relegated military service to " an introductory course " instead of a full meal .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mutual distrust kept conscription alive one of the main reasons for conscription and maintaining an army in readiness in the past was the deep mistrust that existed between the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and west germany .
service in the military for all men over the age of 18 became compulsory in 1956 .
the option of doing civil service instead of military service was introduced in 1961 .
over the years , the amount of time one had to serve in the military has been reduced .
in the 1960s it was 18 months .
after january 2002 that number had fallen to nine months .
in the former gdr , compulsory military service was introduced in 1962 .
there are currently about 250,000 men in the german army .
of that amount , 68,270 are conscripts and of those , 25,270 are soldiers who volunteered to remain a few months longer after their mandatory service was up .
future possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association another concern of reducing military service is the concomitant effect on civil service positions that have been filled by men who chose not to serve in the military .
some have said this loss of manpower to civil organizations would be harmful .
but peter tobiassen , the head of an organization that represents conscientious objectors , has said that there are three times as many applicants for those positions than there are jobs available .
while the cdu and csu want to maintain some sort of military conscription in the future , the idea of an all-voluntary military continues to circulate .
in an interview in july , germany 's incoming foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said that while conscription had its merits , it was a thing of the past .
ulrich kirsch , the chairman of the federal armed forces association said that the german army was " open to " the idea of an all voluntary force , but more research was needed .
in any event , kirsch noted that changing to an all voluntary army would require amending the constitution , which would take a two-thirds majority , and that that was not going to happen in the near future. av / dpa / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 24.10.2009 germany 's new top diplomat untested in foreign affairs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle has little direct experience of foreign policy guido westerwelle is to become germany 's foreign minister when chancellor merkel 's new government takes office next week .
but with no ministerial or foreign affairs experience , what does he bring to the table ? guido westerwelle , 47 , led the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to their best-ever result in the september 27 election , with the party taking just under 15 percent of the vote .
that ended an 11-year spell in opposition for the fdp and paved the way for it to become the junior coalition partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
it has also handed westerwelle a chance to move on from his role as leader of the opposition and on to greener pastures .
the roles of foreign minister and vice-chancellor are traditionally awarded to the leader of the junior party in federal coalition governments .
westerwelle assumes these positions from social democrat frank-walter steinmeier , who was also the spd 's chancellor candidate in the recent election .
political freshman but with only experience outside of government , and a political career that has barely , if ever , involved foreign relations , some are asking what westerwelle can bring to the position .
he has little direct experience of foreign policy but has recently made some visits abroad , including to russia .
his party is pro-american and westerwelle is not expected to deviate from the approach of his predecessors , nor from the " basic tenets " of post-war german foreign policy .
on saturday , oct .
24 , westerwelle said nuclear non-proliferation and the removal of us atomic warheads from german soil would be a priority for his ministry .
merkel has said this would be achieved through dialog with germany 's partners in the nato forum .
westerwelle is also known to be a supporter of stronger trans-atlantic ties , and is a member of the non-partisan atlantik bruecke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization , dedicated to achieving this goal .
but that wo n't necessarily mean that germany will give in to us wishes to commit more troops to afghanistan .
while westerwelle has been vague on many foreign-policy points , he has stated clearly his aversion to any expansion in german army operations under nato .
questions over effectiveness but westerwelle is bound to make waves for being europe 's first openly gay foreign minister , having publicly " come out " at merkel 's 50th birthday party .
the trained lawyer has dismissed any notion that this could pose problems in his role as foreign minister .
" some other countries may have had a problem with the fact that angela merkel became the first female chancellor of germany .
of course she does not wear a veil on the red carpet when she visits certain arab states , " he has been quoted as saying .
" the decision as to whom we send as a government representative rests solely with us germans , based on our political and moral standards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle introduced his partner michael mronz , right , some five years ago born in bad honnef , near bonn in western germany , westerwelle was elected to the german parliament in 1996 and became head of the fdp in 2001 .
westerwelle 's seeming reluctance to speak english has raised some questions about his suitability for the post of germany 's top diplomat .
westerwelle declined to answer a question in english that had been put to him by a bbc reporter during his first news conference after last month 's elections . " in great britain it is expected that people speak english , and it is the same in germany - people are expected to speak german , " westerwelle said at the time , prompting heated debate on the internet .
on the domestic front , the thorniest issue for westerwelle has been over tax cuts .
the free democrats had promised voters 35 billion euros worth of cuts in the recent election , but merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wanted only 15 billion euros .
on saturday , the coalition partners put this issue to bed , agreeing on 24 billion euros in cuts. dfm / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german parties reach coalition deal chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives are set to form a coalition government after sealing a deal with the free democrats .
the agreement came after the parties struck a compromise on thorny financial issues .

" that 's how art historian aby warburg saw himself in his own words . one of his most outstanding achievements was the founding of the warburg cultural studies library , which was officially opened in 1926 .
with four levels , the library was not exactly small , but it was designed in a space-saving manner .
narrow corridors and low doors awaited the visitors behind a red-brick facade .
the library 's infrastructure included the most modern technology of the time for transporting the books from one place to another , including special conveyor belts .
there were 26 telephone connections , a pneumatic tube , and an elevator for books and for staff .
a costly blank check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warburg was a great achiever , though plagued by mental instability warburg financed his library through his father 's banking firm , and later through that of his brother 's , who had moved to the united states .
" when aby was 13 years old , he offered me his firstborn rights , " said warburg 's brother , max .
" since he was the oldest , he was meant to go into the family business .
i was 12 at the time and agreed to buy his firstborn rights .
but he asked me to promise that i would always buy him all the books that he needed .
and , after short consideration , i agreed . "
in this way , warburg 's brother closed the deal - without realizing that this " exchange " involved writing out what was probably the most expensive blank check of his life .
behind the achievement of the library , there was a fragile human being .
with his poor health and bouts of depression , warburg from time to time underwent psychotherapy .
in 1918 , at the end of world war i , he suffered a mental breakdown - a culmination of his phobias , obsessions and delusions .
at the same time , however , he managed to gain widespread acclaim as an art historian , private scholar and researcher .
a non-traditional approach warburg was not interested in a purely aesthetic approach to art history .
his personal focus was the debate over the legacy of antiquity , which he approached with his portrayal of sandro botticelli 's works , the art of florentine painter , works by albrecht duerer and ancient pagan prophecies in written and visual representations .
" one day , i 'm sitting in the library 's lecture room with a newspaper from 1915 , " said rene drommert , a student librarian at the warburg house in the 1920s .
" suddenly , aby warburg appears and says , ' what are you doing there , mr drommert ? '
and i say : ' i 'm interested in the world war i era . '

many renowned scholars worked in the library 's reading room , including ernst cassirer , erwin panofsky and albert einstein .
according to charles hope , art historian and director of the warburg institute in london , what stands out is the prevalence of jewish scholars at the library .

" their jewish background was of limited importance to them . "

thanks to generous support on the british side , the library was preserved .
today , with 350,000 books , it is called the warburg institute and it is still one of the most significant humanities-oriented book collections in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cultural studies library is one of europe 's most important book collections the library gained its good reputation thanks to its unusual collection of books , as well as its interdisciplinary classification system , which links together very different subject areas : psychology and anthropology , theater , celebration and music , astrology and astronomy , chemistry and mathematics .
warburg himself had arranged the books in an interdisciplinary manner , and even the library 's architectural details reflected his educational motivations .

but with no ministerial or foreign affairs experience , what does he bring to the table ? guido westerwelle , 47 , led the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to their best-ever result in the september 27 election , with the party taking just under 15 percent of the vote .
that ended an 11-year spell in opposition for the fdp and paved the way for it to become the junior coalition partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
it has also handed westerwelle a chance to move on from his role as leader of the opposition and on to greener pastures .
the roles of foreign minister and vice-chancellor are traditionally awarded to the leader of the junior party in federal coalition governments .
westerwelle assumes these positions from social democrat frank-walter steinmeier , who was also the spd 's chancellor candidate in the recent election .
political freshman but with only experience outside of government , and a political career that has barely , if ever , involved foreign relations , some are asking what westerwelle can bring to the position .
he has little direct experience of foreign policy but has recently made some visits abroad , including to russia .
his party is pro-american and westerwelle is not expected to deviate from the approach of his predecessors , nor from the " basic tenets " of post-war german foreign policy .
on saturday , oct .
24 , westerwelle said nuclear non-proliferation and the removal of us atomic warheads from german soil would be a priority for his ministry .
merkel has said this would be achieved through dialog with germany 's partners in the nato forum .
westerwelle is also known to be a supporter of stronger trans-atlantic ties , and is a member of the non-partisan atlantik bruecke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization , dedicated to achieving this goal .
but that wo n't necessarily mean that germany will give in to us wishes to commit more troops to afghanistan .
while westerwelle has been vague on many foreign-policy points , he has stated clearly his aversion to any expansion in german army operations under nato .
questions over effectiveness but westerwelle is bound to make waves for being europe 's first openly gay foreign minister , having publicly " come out " at merkel 's 50th birthday party .
the trained lawyer has dismissed any notion that this could pose problems in his role as foreign minister .
" some other countries may have had a problem with the fact that angela merkel became the first female chancellor of germany .
of course she does not wear a veil on the red carpet when she visits certain arab states , " he has been quoted as saying .

westerwelle 's seeming reluctance to speak english has raised some questions about his suitability for the post of germany 's top diplomat .
westerwelle declined to answer a question in english that had been put to him by a bbc reporter during his first news conference after last month 's elections . " in great britain it is expected that people speak english , and it is the same in germany - people are expected to speak german , " westerwelle said at the time , prompting heated debate on the internet .

but with no ministerial or foreign affairs experience , what does he bring to the table ? guido westerwelle , 47 , led the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to their best-ever result in the september 27 election , with the party taking just under 15 percent of the vote .
that ended an 11-year spell in opposition for the fdp and paved the way for it to become the junior coalition partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
it has also handed westerwelle a chance to move on from his role as leader of the opposition and on to greener pastures .
the roles of foreign minister and vice-chancellor are traditionally awarded to the leader of the junior party in federal coalition governments .
westerwelle assumes these positions from social democrat frank-walter steinmeier , who was also the spd 's chancellor candidate in the recent election .
political freshman but with only experience outside of government , and a political career that has barely , if ever , involved foreign relations , some are asking what westerwelle can bring to the position .
he has little direct experience of foreign policy but has recently made some visits abroad , including to russia .
his party is pro-american and westerwelle is not expected to deviate from the approach of his predecessors , nor from the " basic tenets " of post-war german foreign policy .
on saturday , oct .
24 , westerwelle said nuclear non-proliferation and the removal of us atomic warheads from german soil would be a priority for his ministry .
merkel has said this would be achieved through dialog with germany 's partners in the nato forum .
westerwelle is also known to be a supporter of stronger trans-atlantic ties , and is a member of the non-partisan atlantik bruecke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization , dedicated to achieving this goal .
but that wo n't necessarily mean that germany will give in to us wishes to commit more troops to afghanistan .
while westerwelle has been vague on many foreign-policy points , he has stated clearly his aversion to any expansion in german army operations under nato .
questions over effectiveness but westerwelle is bound to make waves for being europe 's first openly gay foreign minister , having publicly " come out " at merkel 's 50th birthday party .
the trained lawyer has dismissed any notion that this could pose problems in his role as foreign minister .
" some other countries may have had a problem with the fact that angela merkel became the first female chancellor of germany .
of course she does not wear a veil on the red carpet when she visits certain arab states , " he has been quoted as saying .
" the decision as to whom we send as a government representative rests solely with us germans , based on our political and moral standards . "

westerwelle 's seeming reluctance to speak english has raised some questions about his suitability for the post of germany 's top diplomat .
westerwelle declined to answer a question in english that had been put to him by a bbc reporter during his first news conference after last month 's elections . " in great britain it is expected that people speak english , and it is the same in germany - people are expected to speak german , " westerwelle said at the time , prompting heated debate on the internet .
on the domestic front , the thorniest issue for westerwelle has been over tax cuts .
the free democrats had promised voters 35 billion euros worth of cuts in the recent election , but merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wanted only 15 billion euros .

“ i suggest that we lock in the determination to act already by copenhagen and seek political commitment for immediate implementation , ” lars lokke rasmussen said on saturday .
he added that it was possible to outline the main components of an agreement to replace that which was forged in kyoto in 1997 , and to implement it early next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 24.10.2009 czech nod raises new hope for eu treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorny obstacles have delayed the treaty and the creation of a new european commission the european union 's lisbon treaty looks set to emerge from a limbo as the last hurdle to its ratification , czech president vaclav klaus , accepted a concession offered by the 27-nation bloc . vaclav klaus is the last eu leader holding out on signing the treaty , which aims to streamline eu decision-making and must be ratified by all members to take effect .
on friday , the staunch eurosceptic accepted a proposal by the swedish eu presidency to handle an opt-out from the treaty which he demands .
" this proposal corresponds to the president 's expectations and he can continue to work with it , " said klaus 's office .
critics of the czech president regard the demand as another attempt to delay the ratification .
however , friday 's statement by klaus 's office is the second glimmer of hope for the eu in a week , after the president suggested just days ago that he would ultimately sign .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , no matter how much some of us would want that , " he said last saturday , fueling hopes that the treaty might take effect soon .
exemption clause on property two weeks ago , klaus asked for an exemption from the treaty that would prevent ethnic germans forced out of his country after world war ii from reclaiming their property .
britain and poland won similar exemptions during the treaty negotiations in 2007 – catholic poland was assured it would not be forced to allow gay marriages , and britain promised that eu laws and courts would not prevail over its own judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso is unable to set up a new commission due to delays to the lisbon treaty stefan fule , czech minister for eu affairs , said the czech exemption would be a general one , comprising a comma and the words " czech republic " attached to " great britain " and " poland " in the treaty 's protocol .
recognizing that the chances that klaus might yield were slim , sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the czech cabinet set out to work on the wording of the exemption , which they hope to submit to the eu for approval at a summit next week .
european commission held up the eu has been waiting in suspense for klaus ' signature , the last step in the czech ratification process after local lawmakers approved the treaty earlier this year .
the impasse means that european commission chief jose manuel barroso , who was last month granted a second five-year term , is unable to nominate a new commission , because it is unclear what legal basis he should use .
the mandate of the current commission – the eu 's executive arm – expires at the end of october .
the body that draws up legislation impacting the lives of about half a billion europeans and policing the application of eu laws is likely to remain a lame duck until the future becomes clearer .
this may take some time as klaus has also linked his signature to a go-ahead from the top czech court , which is currently assessing the treaty 's compliance with the country 's constitution following a complaint filed by a group of eurosceptic senators .
like president klaus , the senators fear the treaty will give too much power to brussels and threaten czech sovereignty .
the court has said it will discuss the complaint in a public hearing on tuesday , but it is unclear how long the process might take .
concerns over further hurdles the president of the european parliament , jerzy buzek , said on friday he expected the lisbon reform treaty to come into force before the end of the year while admitting that challenges persisted .
" it 's my personal opinion : i can say that it 's a very high probability that we will have our lisbon treaty in place at the end of this year , " he said in an interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus recently conceded that the lisbon treaty is inevitable however , buzek voiced concerns an opt-out deal with the czechs could " bring problems in other member states " .
" we would like to have a solution proper for the czech republic and for president klaus to sign the lisbon treaty .
but of course we would n't like to have problems in other member states , " he said .

recognizing that the chances that klaus might yield were slim , sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the czech cabinet set out to work on the wording of the exemption , which they hope to submit to the eu for approval at a summit next week .
european commission held up the eu has been waiting in suspense for klaus ' signature , the last step in the czech ratification process after local lawmakers approved the treaty earlier this year .
the impasse means that european commission chief jose manuel barroso , who was last month granted a second five-year term , is unable to nominate a new commission , because it is unclear what legal basis he should use .
the mandate of the current commission – the eu 's executive arm – expires at the end of october .
the body that draws up legislation impacting the lives of about half a billion europeans and policing the application of eu laws is likely to remain a lame duck until the future becomes clearer .
this may take some time as klaus has also linked his signature to a go-ahead from the top czech court , which is currently assessing the treaty 's compliance with the country 's constitution following a complaint filed by a group of eurosceptic senators .
like president klaus , the senators fear the treaty will give too much power to brussels and threaten czech sovereignty .
the court has said it will discuss the complaint in a public hearing on tuesday , but it is unclear how long the process might take .
concerns over further hurdles the president of the european parliament , jerzy buzek , said on friday he expected the lisbon reform treaty to come into force before the end of the year while admitting that challenges persisted .
" it 's my personal opinion : i can say that it 's a very high probability that we will have our lisbon treaty in place at the end of this year , " he said in an interview .

but of course we would n't like to have problems in other member states , " he said .

on friday , the staunch eurosceptic accepted a proposal by the swedish eu presidency to handle an opt-out from the treaty which he demands .
" this proposal corresponds to the president 's expectations and he can continue to work with it , " said klaus 's office .
critics of the czech president regard the demand as another attempt to delay the ratification .
however , friday 's statement by klaus 's office is the second glimmer of hope for the eu in a week , after the president suggested just days ago that he would ultimately sign .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , no matter how much some of us would want that , " he said last saturday , fueling hopes that the treaty might take effect soon .
exemption clause on property two weeks ago , klaus asked for an exemption from the treaty that would prevent ethnic germans forced out of his country after world war ii from reclaiming their property .
britain and poland won similar exemptions during the treaty negotiations in 2007 – catholic poland was assured it would not be forced to allow gay marriages , and britain promised that eu laws and courts would not prevail over its own judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso is unable to set up a new commission due to delays to the lisbon treaty stefan fule , czech minister for eu affairs , said the czech exemption would be a general one , comprising a comma and the words " czech republic " attached to " great britain " and " poland " in the treaty 's protocol .
recognizing that the chances that klaus might yield were slim , sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the czech cabinet set out to work on the wording of the exemption , which they hope to submit to the eu for approval at a summit next week .
european commission held up the eu has been waiting in suspense for klaus ' signature , the last step in the czech ratification process after local lawmakers approved the treaty earlier this year .
the impasse means that european commission chief jose manuel barroso , who was last month granted a second five-year term , is unable to nominate a new commission , because it is unclear what legal basis he should use .
the mandate of the current commission – the eu 's executive arm – expires at the end of october .
the body that draws up legislation impacting the lives of about half a billion europeans and policing the application of eu laws is likely to remain a lame duck until the future becomes clearer .
this may take some time as klaus has also linked his signature to a go-ahead from the top czech court , which is currently assessing the treaty 's compliance with the country 's constitution following a complaint filed by a group of eurosceptic senators .
like president klaus , the senators fear the treaty will give too much power to brussels and threaten czech sovereignty .
the court has said it will discuss the complaint in a public hearing on tuesday , but it is unclear how long the process might take .
concerns over further hurdles the president of the european parliament , jerzy buzek , said on friday he expected the lisbon reform treaty to come into force before the end of the year while admitting that challenges persisted .
" it 's my personal opinion : i can say that it 's a very high probability that we will have our lisbon treaty in place at the end of this year , " he said in an interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus recently conceded that the lisbon treaty is inevitable however , buzek voiced concerns an opt-out deal with the czechs could " bring problems in other member states " .
" we would like to have a solution proper for the czech republic and for president klaus to sign the lisbon treaty .
but of course we would n't like to have problems in other member states , " he said .
concerns that more countries may try to negotiate footnotes to the charter intensified last week after slovak prime minister robert fico said he may ask for an opt-out clause for his country if the czechs succeed. rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a poll conducted by yougov for the daily telegraph newspaper released on saturday shows that 22 percent of britons would " seriously consider " voting bnp in a future local , general or european election .
according to the website of the daily telegraph newspaper , this included four percent who said they would " definitely " consider voting for the party , three percent who would " probably " consider it , and 15 percent who said they were " possible " bnp voters .
two-thirds of those polled said they would not consider voting for the party " under any circumstances , " while the rest were undecided .
more than half of those surveyed agreed with the bnp or thought the party " had a point " in wishing to " speak up for the interests of the indigenous , white british people ... which successive governments have done far too little to protect . "
griffin , who was a guest on bbc 's " question time , " was asked about his views on the holocaust , immigration , islam and homosexuality by a panel and members of the audience .
he has accused the broadcaster of setting a lynch mob on him in a controversial edition of the show , which was watched by a record 8.2 million people – almost three times the average number of viewers .
he demanded that the bbc give him a " second chance " to get his views across , and insisted that " the british people are aghast at the display of bias from the bbc . "
recruitment flood the far-right , anti-immigration party claimed friday that 3,000 people registered to sign up as members after the show in what it described as its " single biggest recruitment night . "
in addition , the bbc said it had received more than 350 complaints from viewers following the screening , the bulk of which accused the broadcaster of bias against the bnp and its leader . among those watching was jean-marie le pen , the leader of france 's far-right national front party , who in 1984 saw his support double overnight after appearing on a high-profile tv political discussion show .
in an interview with london 's evening standard newspaper on friday , le pen suggested that the bnp would receive a boost from the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demonstrated outside bbc studios on the day of show " small fish will become big so long as god gives them life .
all political groups have started as marginal before becoming important , " he said . downing street said prime minister gordon brown did not watch question time but thanked justice secretary jack straw for appearing as the representative of the ruling labour party .
straw said the program had been " catastrophic " for griffin who had been " exposed as a fantasizing conspiracy theorist with some very unpleasant views and no moral compass . "
cabinet minister peter hain , a veteran anti-apartheid campaigner who fought unsuccessfully to try to stop griffin 's appearance , said : " this is exactly what i feared and warned about . " the bbc has handed the bnp the gift of the century on a plate and now we see the consequences , " he added .

a poll conducted by yougov for the daily telegraph newspaper released on saturday shows that 22 percent of britons would " seriously consider " voting bnp in a future local , general or european election .
according to the website of the daily telegraph newspaper , this included four percent who said they would " definitely " consider voting for the party , three percent who would " probably " consider it , and 15 percent who said they were " possible " bnp voters .
two-thirds of those polled said they would not consider voting for the party " under any circumstances , " while the rest were undecided .
more than half of those surveyed agreed with the bnp or thought the party " had a point " in wishing to " speak up for the interests of the indigenous , white british people ... which successive governments have done far too little to protect . "
griffin , who was a guest on bbc 's " question time , " was asked about his views on the holocaust , immigration , islam and homosexuality by a panel and members of the audience .
he has accused the broadcaster of setting a lynch mob on him in a controversial edition of the show , which was watched by a record 8.2 million people – almost three times the average number of viewers .
he demanded that the bbc give him a " second chance " to get his views across , and insisted that " the british people are aghast at the display of bias from the bbc . "
recruitment flood the far-right , anti-immigration party claimed friday that 3,000 people registered to sign up as members after the show in what it described as its " single biggest recruitment night . "
in addition , the bbc said it had received more than 350 complaints from viewers following the screening , the bulk of which accused the broadcaster of bias against the bnp and its leader . among those watching was jean-marie le pen , the leader of france 's far-right national front party , who in 1984 saw his support double overnight after appearing on a high-profile tv political discussion show .
in an interview with london 's evening standard newspaper on friday , le pen suggested that the bnp would receive a boost from the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demonstrated outside bbc studios on the day of show " small fish will become big so long as god gives them life .
all political groups have started as marginal before becoming important , " he said . downing street said prime minister gordon brown did not watch question time but thanked justice secretary jack straw for appearing as the representative of the ruling labour party .
straw said the program had been " catastrophic " for griffin who had been " exposed as a fantasizing conspiracy theorist with some very unpleasant views and no moral compass . "
cabinet minister peter hain , a veteran anti-apartheid campaigner who fought unsuccessfully to try to stop griffin 's appearance , said : " this is exactly what i feared and warned about . " the bbc has handed the bnp the gift of the century on a plate and now we see the consequences , " he added .

just hours after reaching consensus , the coalition partners announced plans to cut taxes from january 1 next year . " the burden on families has to be lessened , the burden on companies and inheritance tax has to be reformed , " chancellor merkel said during a press conference in berlin on saturday . " we are aiming for growth , " she said , adding that the new government would focus on education and social cohesion .
" we have agreed a coalition program showing that we want to advance courageously into the future . " at the joint news conference with merkel , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , described the coalition agreement as " a great compass for our country . " sharing key cabinet posts the parties divided up key cabinet posts , with current interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the cdu being chosen to head the finance ministry , while the fdp 's westerwelle is to become foreign minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has earned a reputation as a hardliner when it comes to security policy the 67-year-old schaeuble , who has been bound to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 and has the reputation of being a hardliner on domestic security policy , was a surprise choice for the post of finance minister .
ahead of the september election , he indirectly criticized merkel 's pledge to pursue billions of euros in tax cuts , saying there was little room for them given germany 's strained finances .
now schaeuble will be charged with implementing those cuts against the backdrop of a deficit that is poised to rise to double european union limits next year .
news of his likely appointment sparked mixed reactions in germany on friday .
“ he 's an unknown entity when it comes to financial issues , " dennis snower , head of the kiel-based institute for economic research , told the reuters news agency .
" you ca n't make any predictions about his future financial policy based on what he 's done so far . "
" i think he 's a tough cookie and this is what will be needed , " carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing financial markets said .
" he is someone who would not be afraid of ruining his public image due to unpopular decision-making . "
thomas de maiziere , merkel 's trusted lieutenant as chief of staff , is set to take over schaeble 's job at the interior ministry .
free democrats bag prominent posts as widely expected , the post of foreign minister goes to fdp leader guido westerwelle .
the 47-year-old is the first openly gay leader of a mainstream political party in germany .
he has no foreign policy or government experience .
rainer bruederle , the fdp 's economics spokesman in the parliament for a decade , is set to replace karl-theodor zu guttenberg as economy minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the asian-born free democrat is a surprise pick the media-savvy guttenberg is set to head the defense ministry .
the 37-year-old , who is a member of the csu party , will be in charge of tackling the afghanistan mission which is deeply unpopular in germany .
the free democrats ' phillip roesler is a surprise pick for the post of health minister .
the 36-year-old , a rising star in the fdp , is currently the economy minister in the state of lower saxony and is reported to have led coalition negotiations on healthcare .
born in vietnam , roesler will germany 's first asian-born cabinet minister , also replacing guttenberg as the youngest member of the cabinet .
compromise on tax cuts the deal over the new government came after the conservative bloc and the free democrats managed to reconcile their promise of billions of euros in tax cuts with a separate pledge to get germany 's deficit – swollen by massive stimulus packages – back under control .
horst seehofer , head of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , admitted the final round of negotiations had been bogged down by financial issues .
" the financial issues at the end are always the most difficult and most exciting and you have to do that with great care , " he said , explaining why the talks stretched into the night .
" but it all worked out in the end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer -lrb- r -rrb- admitted that the final round of coalition talks was tough to spur growth , the alliance plans to cut income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- between 2011 and 2013 , according to seehofer .
that is more than the 20 billion euros merkel wanted but far less than 35 billion euros the fdp sought .
" that number is right – even if you did n't hear it from me first , " seehofer said .
" i 'm very pleased with this result , " he added , referring to the coalition agreement after the protracted talks .
" we 've come up with a reasonable plan for the next four years and the coalition has set up a good platform for economic recovery in germany . " rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the reaction from all sides has been swift and not all of it is positive . a deal to reduce the period of compulsory military service in germany was worked out between chancellor angela merkel 's incoming government coalition of the conservative union parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
as of january 1 , 2011 , military service will be reduced from nine months to six .
in its election platform , the fdp had called for an abolishment of conscription , however chancellor merkel prefers to keep some form of military service .
as it now stands , young men are obliged to do a compulsory tour of duty in the german military .
they can opt out or refuse , but then must perform " civilian service , " such as working in a hospital , nursing home or other civil organization .
under the new proposal , military service will consist of three months of basic training , two months of specialized training and one month of duty in specialist service units .
the reactions to the deal have been swift and varied .
while werner hoyer , a member of the fdp , called it a reasonable compromise , johannes kahrs , a leader in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the proposal pure nonsense .
" for military service to have any value at all , it should take at least nine months , " said kahrs in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper .
spd defense expert rainer arnold said that lowering the time from nine months to six relegated military service to " an introductory course " instead of a full meal .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mutual distrust kept conscription alive one of the main reasons for conscription and maintaining an army in readiness in the past was the deep mistrust that existed between the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and west germany .
service in the military for all men over the age of 18 became compulsory in 1956 .
the option of doing civil service instead of military service was introduced in 1961 .
over the years , the amount of time one had to serve in the military has been reduced .
in the 1960s it was 18 months .
after january 2002 that number had fallen to nine months .
in the former gdr , compulsory military service was introduced in 1962 .
there are currently about 250,000 men in the german army .
of that amount , 68,270 are conscripts and of those , 25,270 are soldiers who volunteered to remain a few months longer after their mandatory service was up .
future possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association another concern of reducing military service is the concomitant effect on civil service positions that have been filled by men who chose not to serve in the military .
some have said this loss of manpower to civil organizations would be harmful .
but peter tobiassen , the head of an organization that represents conscientious objectors , has said that there are three times as many applicants for those positions than there are jobs available .
while the cdu and csu want to maintain some sort of military conscription in the future , the idea of an all-voluntary military continues to circulate .
in an interview in july , germany 's incoming foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said that while conscription had its merits , it was a thing of the past .
ulrich kirsch , the chairman of the federal armed forces association said that the german army was " open to " the idea of an all voluntary force , but more research was needed .
in any event , kirsch noted that changing to an all voluntary army would require amending the constitution , which would take a two-thirds majority , and that that was not going to happen in the near future. av / dpa / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after january 2002 that number had fallen to nine months .
in the former gdr , compulsory military service was introduced in 1962 .
there are currently about 250,000 men in the german army .
of that amount , 68,270 are conscripts and of those , 25,270 are soldiers who volunteered to remain a few months longer after their mandatory service was up .
future possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association another concern of reducing military service is the concomitant effect on civil service positions that have been filled by men who chose not to serve in the military .
some have said this loss of manpower to civil organizations would be harmful .
but peter tobiassen , the head of an organization that represents conscientious objectors , has said that there are three times as many applicants for those positions than there are jobs available .
while the cdu and csu want to maintain some sort of military conscription in the future , the idea of an all-voluntary military continues to circulate .
in an interview in july , germany 's incoming foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said that while conscription had its merits , it was a thing of the past .
ulrich kirsch , the chairman of the federal armed forces association said that the german army was " open to " the idea of an all voluntary force , but more research was needed .
in any event , kirsch noted that changing to an all voluntary army would require amending the constitution , which would take a two-thirds majority , and that that was not going to happen in the near future. av / dpa / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the reaction from all sides has been swift and not all of it is positive . a deal to reduce the period of compulsory military service in germany was worked out between chancellor angela merkel 's incoming government coalition of the conservative union parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
as of january 1 , 2011 , military service will be reduced from nine months to six .
in its election platform , the fdp had called for an abolishment of conscription , however chancellor merkel prefers to keep some form of military service .
as it now stands , young men are obliged to do a compulsory tour of duty in the german military .
they can opt out or refuse , but then must perform " civilian service , " such as working in a hospital , nursing home or other civil organization .
under the new proposal , military service will consist of three months of basic training , two months of specialized training and one month of duty in specialist service units .
the reactions to the deal have been swift and varied .
while werner hoyer , a member of the fdp , called it a reasonable compromise , johannes kahrs , a leader in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the proposal pure nonsense .
" for military service to have any value at all , it should take at least nine months , " said kahrs in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper .
spd defense expert rainer arnold said that lowering the time from nine months to six relegated military service to " an introductory course " instead of a full meal .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mutual distrust kept conscription alive one of the main reasons for conscription and maintaining an army in readiness in the past was the deep mistrust that existed between the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and west germany .
service in the military for all men over the age of 18 became compulsory in 1956 .
the option of doing civil service instead of military service was introduced in 1961 .
over the years , the amount of time one had to serve in the military has been reduced .
in the 1960s it was 18 months .
after january 2002 that number had fallen to nine months .
in the former gdr , compulsory military service was introduced in 1962 .
there are currently about 250,000 men in the german army .
of that amount , 68,270 are conscripts and of those , 25,270 are soldiers who volunteered to remain a few months longer after their mandatory service was up .
future possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association another concern of reducing military service is the concomitant effect on civil service positions that have been filled by men who chose not to serve in the military .
some have said this loss of manpower to civil organizations would be harmful .
but peter tobiassen , the head of an organization that represents conscientious objectors , has said that there are three times as many applicants for those positions than there are jobs available .
while the cdu and csu want to maintain some sort of military conscription in the future , the idea of an all-voluntary military continues to circulate .
in an interview in july , germany 's incoming foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said that while conscription had its merits , it was a thing of the past .
ulrich kirsch , the chairman of the federal armed forces association said that the german army was " open to " the idea of an all voluntary force , but more research was needed .
in any event , kirsch noted that changing to an all voluntary army would require amending the constitution , which would take a two-thirds majority , and that that was not going to happen in the near future. av / dpa / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that 's how art historian aby warburg saw himself in his own words . one of his most outstanding achievements was the founding of the warburg cultural studies library , which was officially opened in 1926 .
with four levels , the library was not exactly small , but it was designed in a space-saving manner .
narrow corridors and low doors awaited the visitors behind a red-brick facade .
the library 's infrastructure included the most modern technology of the time for transporting the books from one place to another , including special conveyor belts .
there were 26 telephone connections , a pneumatic tube , and an elevator for books and for staff .

" that 's how art historian aby warburg saw himself in his own words . one of his most outstanding achievements was the founding of the warburg cultural studies library , which was officially opened in 1926 .
with four levels , the library was not exactly small , but it was designed in a space-saving manner .
narrow corridors and low doors awaited the visitors behind a red-brick facade .
the library 's infrastructure included the most modern technology of the time for transporting the books from one place to another , including special conveyor belts .
there were 26 telephone connections , a pneumatic tube , and an elevator for books and for staff .
a costly blank check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warburg was a great achiever , though plagued by mental instability warburg financed his library through his father 's banking firm , and later through that of his brother 's , who had moved to the united states .
" when aby was 13 years old , he offered me his firstborn rights , " said warburg 's brother , max .
" since he was the oldest , he was meant to go into the family business .
i was 12 at the time and agreed to buy his firstborn rights .
but he asked me to promise that i would always buy him all the books that he needed .
and , after short consideration , i agreed . "
in this way , warburg 's brother closed the deal - without realizing that this " exchange " involved writing out what was probably the most expensive blank check of his life .
behind the achievement of the library , there was a fragile human being .
with his poor health and bouts of depression , warburg from time to time underwent psychotherapy .
in 1918 , at the end of world war i , he suffered a mental breakdown - a culmination of his phobias , obsessions and delusions .
at the same time , however , he managed to gain widespread acclaim as an art historian , private scholar and researcher .
a non-traditional approach warburg was not interested in a purely aesthetic approach to art history .
his personal focus was the debate over the legacy of antiquity , which he approached with his portrayal of sandro botticelli 's works , the art of florentine painter , works by albrecht duerer and ancient pagan prophecies in written and visual representations .
" one day , i 'm sitting in the library 's lecture room with a newspaper from 1915 , " said rene drommert , a student librarian at the warburg house in the 1920s .
" suddenly , aby warburg appears and says , ' what are you doing there , mr drommert ? '
and i say : ' i 'm interested in the world war i era . '
warburg then bends over the desk and points to an advertisement offering flour and potatoes in exchange for a carpet .
and he says : ' naturally , you have the include things like this to get a good idea of the cultural and social life at the time . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for warburg , art was not just aesthetics , but the way people lived in warburg 's lifetime , the cultural studies library was considered to be an intellectual center in the weimar republic - and it remained that way till after his death on october 26 , 1929 .
many renowned scholars worked in the library 's reading room , including ernst cassirer , erwin panofsky and albert einstein .
according to charles hope , art historian and director of the warburg institute in london , what stands out is the prevalence of jewish scholars at the library .
" in my opinion , these people did not think that their jewishness had a large influence on their scholarliness , " said hope .
" their jewish background was of limited importance to them . "
second start in england this was until the rise of the nazi party threatened the library 's survival and forced it to move to london , which it did on december 12 , 1933 .
thanks to generous support on the british side , the library was preserved .
today , with 350,000 books , it is called the warburg institute and it is still one of the most significant humanities-oriented book collections in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cultural studies library is one of europe 's most important book collections the library gained its good reputation thanks to its unusual collection of books , as well as its interdisciplinary classification system , which links together very different subject areas : psychology and anthropology , theater , celebration and music , astrology and astronomy , chemistry and mathematics .
warburg himself had arranged the books in an interdisciplinary manner , and even the library 's architectural details reflected his educational motivations .
in the center was an oval reading and lecture room , because " warburg wanted an elliptical shape , as he believed that it helps people stay alert , whereas a circular room makes you sleepy , " according to hamburg art historian and warburg scholar martin warnke .
" also , it was because astronomer johannes kepler had proved that the earth and other planets followed an elliptical orbit , " said warnke .

party chief gregor gysi said berlin was about to embark on a path of " privatizing social risks , " with the majority shouldering the costs of the mistakes made by a few .

" in terms of environment , transport , energy , and climate protections , the coalition agreement is a worst case scenario , " the greens ' chief claudia roth said on saturday .
environment groups have equally condemned the deal which abandons earlier plans for germany to scrap nuclear power by the year 2020 .
greenpeace described the coalition 's plans as a " clear failure when it comes to protecting the environment . "
allowing a longer life span to older nuclear plants is a " fatal sign " according to greenpeace .
berlin 's decision to back genetically modified crops has also sparked an outcry among environmentalists .
applause from industry and employers german business and industry however , have applauded the new deal as a step in the right direction to help germany fight its way out of the financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundt , representing german employers , says the deal is a good compass the head of the confederation of german employers associations , dieter hundt , described it as a " good compass for the coming years , " criticizing only that the coalition did n't go far enough in making employment regulations more flexible .
hans-peter keil , president of the federation of german industries , said the deal was going into the right direction but expressed disappointment that there had n't been enough courage to push through further reforms .
especially research and innovation should have received more support , he said .

but it 's sparked mixed reactions in germany . the agreement , finalized in the early hours of saturday morning , come three weeks of bargaining and almost a month after merkel 's conservatives and the fdp won a parliamentary majority in federal elections .
the new coalition will look to extend the lifespans of nuclear power plants it judges safe , change banking supervision rules to give the bundesbank greater powers and ensure continuity in foreign policy , according to the 128-page coalition agreement .
the centerpiece of the agreement is a plan to slash income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- , in particular reducing the tax burden on families with children and reforms to corporate and inheritance tax .
the plans have met with praise from industry leaders but germany 's political opposition and environmental groups have slammed them as unrealistic and damaging .
steinmeier : " false start " the leading opposition party social democrats has slammed the coalition deal as a shift in the wrong direction .
the social democrats were part of an uneasy " grand coalition " with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives for the last four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier warns of a widening gap between rich and poor outgoing foreign minister and head of the social democrats ' parliamentary group , frank-walter steinmeier described the deal as a " grand false start . "
steinmeier ran as merkel 's main challenger in the bid for the chancellery .
" nothing will get better , but there will be less security and things will get a lot more expensive .
this coalition will widen the social divisions in this country instead of fighting them , " steinmeier told newspaper bild am sonntag . the head of the social democrats , siegmar gabriel criticized the coalition for embarking on a course against the common good with an unrealistic financial plan . several economists too have expressed scepticism about how the new government would finance its tax plans in light of the country 's ballooning deficit as germany struggles with its most severe recession since world war ii . the left party accused the incoming government of failing to handle the costs of the economic crisis in a fair way .
party chief gregor gysi said berlin was about to embark on a path of " privatizing social risks , " with the majority shouldering the costs of the mistakes made by a few .
criticism over pro-nuclear policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shut down those nuclear power plants , says roth the opposition green party has accused the incoming government of endangering social peace in germany . " in terms of environment , transport , energy , and climate protections , the coalition agreement is a worst case scenario , " the greens ' chief claudia roth said on saturday .
environment groups have equally condemned the deal which abandons earlier plans for germany to scrap nuclear power by the year 2020 .
greenpeace described the coalition 's plans as a " clear failure when it comes to protecting the environment . "
allowing a longer life span to older nuclear plants is a " fatal sign " according to greenpeace .
berlin 's decision to back genetically modified crops has also sparked an outcry among environmentalists .
applause from industry and employers german business and industry however , have applauded the new deal as a step in the right direction to help germany fight its way out of the financial crisis .

the evils of war are still so deeply embedded in the fabric of society that for many that three letter word reads as if it were one of four . against that backdrop , it is an unwelcome thought among germans that some of their fellow countrymen are willing to go to war in the name of money rather than in the name of their nation .
indeed the existence of german mercenaries is a claim that many civilians would be quick to refute , insisting instead that private military companies are the preserve of the americans . but , franz hutsch , ex-officer , war reporter and author of a new book on the growing numbers of german mercenaries says such thinking is downright wrong .

and therein , as far as franz hutsch is concerned , lies a big problem . " i object to the fact that the know-how soldiers have acquired from the german armed forces -lrb- bundeswehr -rrb- might later be used against the bundeswehr or against nato , " he said , citing the possibility of future wars in which german mercenaries are paid to shoot their former comrades . but the spokesman for the bundeswehr association , wilfried stolze , dismisses the suggestion out of hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experience abroad is a hot commodity among recruiters " unimaginable science fiction , " he told deutsche welle .

hutsch says it amounts to semantics .

" i object to the fact that the know-how soldiers have acquired from the german armed forces -lrb- bundeswehr -rrb- might later be used against the bundeswehr or against nato , " he said , citing the possibility of future wars in which german mercenaries are paid to shoot their former comrades . but the spokesman for the bundeswehr association , wilfried stolze , dismisses the suggestion out of hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experience abroad is a hot commodity among recruiters " unimaginable science fiction , " he told deutsche welle .
" we know there are mercenaries in other countries , but it is not something we are familiar with in germany . " preatoria spokesman marc tuernau , however , said his outfit receives applications from germans looking to get on to their files " on a fairly regular basis . " not a new phenomenon hutsch , who spent months in the company of mercenaries in the course of researching his book , says german mercenaries have been part of the military landscape since the bosnian war .
it is only now , however , that the secrecy in which they have long been shrouded , is beginning to fray around the edges . that , from the author 's point of view , is a good thing .
he says the very principle of soldiers of fortune is cockeyed .
" they arrive in a warzone and are supposed to put an end to the hostilities , but they love war because they live from it , so they do n't want it to stop . " and that living can amount to quite something .
us congress findings from last year revealed that western european mercenaries can expect to earn as much as $ 1,357 -lrb- 954 euros -rrb- each day . so what exactly do they have to do for their money ?
praetoria says the task list of their recruits is long and varied , ranging from personal and building protection to administrative and reconstruction work . but can those engaged in reconstruction - albeit through a private military firm - be referred to as mercenaries ?
hutsch says it amounts to semantics .
citing a study by ulrich petersohn for the german institute for international and security affairs , he said the german government has outsourced many tasks which would once have been done by soldiers to what it calls ' contractors ' . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many guns are put into contractors ' hands ?
" afghan militiamen armed with kalashnikovs guard camps of german soldiers , " he said , adding that logistics crews take care of vehicle repairs and cooking in a bid to free up the inadequate number of german troops to patrol and fight . a step in the wrong direction ? when asked to comment on the nature and extent of work done by ' contractors ' , the minsitry of defense in berlin said it does not collect or keep on file any information regarding the engagement of private security enterprises .
yet wilfried stolze says the bundeswehr has certainly been known to hire local people to take on non-combative work , paid for " out of the ministry of defense budget . "
he stressed that it was a good thing , as it enabled indigenous populations to earn some money . franz hutsch , however , says it is anything but a good thing .
he describes it as a step toward " close cooperation " with mercenaries and a step which could lead to situations 10 to 15 years from now in which smaller conflicts are fought out entirely by soldiers of fortune . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the body of a german soldier arrives back on home ground " mercenaries are always used to keep a war out of the public eye , " the writer said .
" a soldier in afghanistan comes home with a flag on his coffin whereas a mercenary who dies , does n't even get a mention . " whatever the nametag reads , there is no denying that private capabilities are a part of contemporary combat .
and that , stresses hutsch , has to be regulated . " we need tighter control over private military companies , " he said , " and greater parliamentary supervision over defense spending in order to see where mercenaries are being used . " franz hutsch 's book " exportschlager tod " is published by econ . author : tamsin walker editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 24.10.2009 german coalition deal draws praise and criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans of the parties to dominate the bundestag are loved by some , disliked by others the coalition deal between chancellor merkel 's conservatives and the business-friendly fdp based on major tax cut plans paves the way for a new center-right government .
but it 's sparked mixed reactions in germany . the agreement , finalized in the early hours of saturday morning , come three weeks of bargaining and almost a month after merkel 's conservatives and the fdp won a parliamentary majority in federal elections .
the new coalition will look to extend the lifespans of nuclear power plants it judges safe , change banking supervision rules to give the bundesbank greater powers and ensure continuity in foreign policy , according to the 128-page coalition agreement .
the centerpiece of the agreement is a plan to slash income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- , in particular reducing the tax burden on families with children and reforms to corporate and inheritance tax .
the plans have met with praise from industry leaders but germany 's political opposition and environmental groups have slammed them as unrealistic and damaging .
steinmeier : " false start " the leading opposition party social democrats has slammed the coalition deal as a shift in the wrong direction .
the social democrats were part of an uneasy " grand coalition " with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives for the last four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier warns of a widening gap between rich and poor outgoing foreign minister and head of the social democrats ' parliamentary group , frank-walter steinmeier described the deal as a " grand false start . "
steinmeier ran as merkel 's main challenger in the bid for the chancellery .
" nothing will get better , but there will be less security and things will get a lot more expensive .
this coalition will widen the social divisions in this country instead of fighting them , " steinmeier told newspaper bild am sonntag . the head of the social democrats , siegmar gabriel criticized the coalition for embarking on a course against the common good with an unrealistic financial plan . several economists too have expressed scepticism about how the new government would finance its tax plans in light of the country 's ballooning deficit as germany struggles with its most severe recession since world war ii . the left party accused the incoming government of failing to handle the costs of the economic crisis in a fair way .
party chief gregor gysi said berlin was about to embark on a path of " privatizing social risks , " with the majority shouldering the costs of the mistakes made by a few .
criticism over pro-nuclear policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shut down those nuclear power plants , says roth the opposition green party has accused the incoming government of endangering social peace in germany . " in terms of environment , transport , energy , and climate protections , the coalition agreement is a worst case scenario , " the greens ' chief claudia roth said on saturday .
environment groups have equally condemned the deal which abandons earlier plans for germany to scrap nuclear power by the year 2020 .
greenpeace described the coalition 's plans as a " clear failure when it comes to protecting the environment . "

but with no ministerial or foreign affairs experience , what does he bring to the table ? guido westerwelle , 47 , led the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to their best-ever result in the september 27 election , with the party taking just under 15 percent of the vote .
that ended an 11-year spell in opposition for the fdp and paved the way for it to become the junior coalition partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
it has also handed westerwelle a chance to move on from his role as leader of the opposition and on to greener pastures .
the roles of foreign minister and vice-chancellor are traditionally awarded to the leader of the junior party in federal coalition governments .
westerwelle assumes these positions from social democrat frank-walter steinmeier , who was also the spd 's chancellor candidate in the recent election .
political freshman but with only experience outside of government , and a political career that has barely , if ever , involved foreign relations , some are asking what westerwelle can bring to the position .
he has little direct experience of foreign policy but has recently made some visits abroad , including to russia .
his party is pro-american and westerwelle is not expected to deviate from the approach of his predecessors , nor from the " basic tenets " of post-war german foreign policy .
on saturday , oct .
24 , westerwelle said nuclear non-proliferation and the removal of us atomic warheads from german soil would be a priority for his ministry .
merkel has said this would be achieved through dialog with germany 's partners in the nato forum .
westerwelle is also known to be a supporter of stronger trans-atlantic ties , and is a member of the non-partisan atlantik bruecke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization , dedicated to achieving this goal .
but that wo n't necessarily mean that germany will give in to us wishes to commit more troops to afghanistan .
while westerwelle has been vague on many foreign-policy points , he has stated clearly his aversion to any expansion in german army operations under nato .
questions over effectiveness but westerwelle is bound to make waves for being europe 's first openly gay foreign minister , having publicly " come out " at merkel 's 50th birthday party .
the trained lawyer has dismissed any notion that this could pose problems in his role as foreign minister .
" some other countries may have had a problem with the fact that angela merkel became the first female chancellor of germany .
of course she does not wear a veil on the red carpet when she visits certain arab states , " he has been quoted as saying .

westerwelle 's seeming reluctance to speak english has raised some questions about his suitability for the post of germany 's top diplomat .
westerwelle declined to answer a question in english that had been put to him by a bbc reporter during his first news conference after last month 's elections . " in great britain it is expected that people speak english , and it is the same in germany - people are expected to speak german , " westerwelle said at the time , prompting heated debate on the internet .

the free democrats had promised voters 35 billion euros worth of cuts in the recent election , but merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wanted only 15 billion euros .

but with no ministerial or foreign affairs experience , what does he bring to the table ? guido westerwelle , 47 , led the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to their best-ever result in the september 27 election , with the party taking just under 15 percent of the vote .
that ended an 11-year spell in opposition for the fdp and paved the way for it to become the junior coalition partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
it has also handed westerwelle a chance to move on from his role as leader of the opposition and on to greener pastures .
the roles of foreign minister and vice-chancellor are traditionally awarded to the leader of the junior party in federal coalition governments .
westerwelle assumes these positions from social democrat frank-walter steinmeier , who was also the spd 's chancellor candidate in the recent election .
political freshman but with only experience outside of government , and a political career that has barely , if ever , involved foreign relations , some are asking what westerwelle can bring to the position .
he has little direct experience of foreign policy but has recently made some visits abroad , including to russia .
his party is pro-american and westerwelle is not expected to deviate from the approach of his predecessors , nor from the " basic tenets " of post-war german foreign policy .
on saturday , oct .
24 , westerwelle said nuclear non-proliferation and the removal of us atomic warheads from german soil would be a priority for his ministry .
merkel has said this would be achieved through dialog with germany 's partners in the nato forum .
westerwelle is also known to be a supporter of stronger trans-atlantic ties , and is a member of the non-partisan atlantik bruecke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization , dedicated to achieving this goal .
but that wo n't necessarily mean that germany will give in to us wishes to commit more troops to afghanistan .
while westerwelle has been vague on many foreign-policy points , he has stated clearly his aversion to any expansion in german army operations under nato .
questions over effectiveness but westerwelle is bound to make waves for being europe 's first openly gay foreign minister , having publicly " come out " at merkel 's 50th birthday party .
the trained lawyer has dismissed any notion that this could pose problems in his role as foreign minister .
" some other countries may have had a problem with the fact that angela merkel became the first female chancellor of germany .
of course she does not wear a veil on the red carpet when she visits certain arab states , " he has been quoted as saying .
" the decision as to whom we send as a government representative rests solely with us germans , based on our political and moral standards . "

westerwelle 's seeming reluctance to speak english has raised some questions about his suitability for the post of germany 's top diplomat .
westerwelle declined to answer a question in english that had been put to him by a bbc reporter during his first news conference after last month 's elections . " in great britain it is expected that people speak english , and it is the same in germany - people are expected to speak german , " westerwelle said at the time , prompting heated debate on the internet .
on the domestic front , the thorniest issue for westerwelle has been over tax cuts .
the free democrats had promised voters 35 billion euros worth of cuts in the recent election , but merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wanted only 15 billion euros .
on saturday , the coalition partners put this issue to bed , agreeing on 24 billion euros in cuts. dfm / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 24.10.2009 new german government to shorten military conscription großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandatory service to be reduced germany 's new coalition government plans to reduce the time that young men must serve in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr .
the reaction from all sides has been swift and not all of it is positive . a deal to reduce the period of compulsory military service in germany was worked out between chancellor angela merkel 's incoming government coalition of the conservative union parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
as of january 1 , 2011 , military service will be reduced from nine months to six .
in its election platform , the fdp had called for an abolishment of conscription , however chancellor merkel prefers to keep some form of military service .
as it now stands , young men are obliged to do a compulsory tour of duty in the german military .
they can opt out or refuse , but then must perform " civilian service , " such as working in a hospital , nursing home or other civil organization .
under the new proposal , military service will consist of three months of basic training , two months of specialized training and one month of duty in specialist service units .
the reactions to the deal have been swift and varied .
while werner hoyer , a member of the fdp , called it a reasonable compromise , johannes kahrs , a leader in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the proposal pure nonsense .
" for military service to have any value at all , it should take at least nine months , " said kahrs in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper .

the reaction from all sides has been swift and not all of it is positive . a deal to reduce the period of compulsory military service in germany was worked out between chancellor angela merkel 's incoming government coalition of the conservative union parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
as of january 1 , 2011 , military service will be reduced from nine months to six .
in its election platform , the fdp had called for an abolishment of conscription , however chancellor merkel prefers to keep some form of military service .
as it now stands , young men are obliged to do a compulsory tour of duty in the german military .
they can opt out or refuse , but then must perform " civilian service , " such as working in a hospital , nursing home or other civil organization .
under the new proposal , military service will consist of three months of basic training , two months of specialized training and one month of duty in specialist service units .
the reactions to the deal have been swift and varied .
while werner hoyer , a member of the fdp , called it a reasonable compromise , johannes kahrs , a leader in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the proposal pure nonsense .
" for military service to have any value at all , it should take at least nine months , " said kahrs in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper .

the agreement came after the parties struck a compromise on thorny financial issues . the late-night agreement paves the way for a new center-right government to take office next week , nearly a month after merkel 's conservatives and the free democrats won a parliamentary majority in the september 27 federal election .
just hours after reaching consensus , the coalition partners announced plans to cut taxes from january 1 next year . " the burden on families has to be lessened , the burden on companies and inheritance tax has to be reformed , " chancellor merkel said during a press conference in berlin on saturday . " we are aiming for growth , " she said , adding that the new government would focus on education and social cohesion .
" we have agreed a coalition program showing that we want to advance courageously into the future . " at the joint news conference with merkel , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , described the coalition agreement as " a great compass for our country . " sharing key cabinet posts the parties divided up key cabinet posts , with current interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the cdu being chosen to head the finance ministry , while the fdp 's westerwelle is to become foreign minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has earned a reputation as a hardliner when it comes to security policy the 67-year-old schaeuble , who has been bound to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 and has the reputation of being a hardliner on domestic security policy , was a surprise choice for the post of finance minister .
ahead of the september election , he indirectly criticized merkel 's pledge to pursue billions of euros in tax cuts , saying there was little room for them given germany 's strained finances .
now schaeuble will be charged with implementing those cuts against the backdrop of a deficit that is poised to rise to double european union limits next year .
news of his likely appointment sparked mixed reactions in germany on friday .
“ he 's an unknown entity when it comes to financial issues , " dennis snower , head of the kiel-based institute for economic research , told the reuters news agency .
" you ca n't make any predictions about his future financial policy based on what he 's done so far . "
" i think he 's a tough cookie and this is what will be needed , " carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing financial markets said .
" he is someone who would not be afraid of ruining his public image due to unpopular decision-making . "
thomas de maiziere , merkel 's trusted lieutenant as chief of staff , is set to take over schaeble 's job at the interior ministry .
free democrats bag prominent posts as widely expected , the post of foreign minister goes to fdp leader guido westerwelle .
the 47-year-old is the first openly gay leader of a mainstream political party in germany .
he has no foreign policy or government experience .
rainer bruederle , the fdp 's economics spokesman in the parliament for a decade , is set to replace karl-theodor zu guttenberg as economy minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the asian-born free democrat is a surprise pick the media-savvy guttenberg is set to head the defense ministry .
the 37-year-old , who is a member of the csu party , will be in charge of tackling the afghanistan mission which is deeply unpopular in germany .
the free democrats ' phillip roesler is a surprise pick for the post of health minister .
the 36-year-old , a rising star in the fdp , is currently the economy minister in the state of lower saxony and is reported to have led coalition negotiations on healthcare .
born in vietnam , roesler will germany 's first asian-born cabinet minister , also replacing guttenberg as the youngest member of the cabinet .
compromise on tax cuts the deal over the new government came after the conservative bloc and the free democrats managed to reconcile their promise of billions of euros in tax cuts with a separate pledge to get germany 's deficit – swollen by massive stimulus packages – back under control .

on friday , the staunch eurosceptic accepted a proposal by the swedish eu presidency to handle an opt-out from the treaty which he demands .
" this proposal corresponds to the president 's expectations and he can continue to work with it , " said klaus 's office .
critics of the czech president regard the demand as another attempt to delay the ratification .
however , friday 's statement by klaus 's office is the second glimmer of hope for the eu in a week , after the president suggested just days ago that he would ultimately sign .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , no matter how much some of us would want that , " he said last saturday , fueling hopes that the treaty might take effect soon .
exemption clause on property two weeks ago , klaus asked for an exemption from the treaty that would prevent ethnic germans forced out of his country after world war ii from reclaiming their property .
britain and poland won similar exemptions during the treaty negotiations in 2007 – catholic poland was assured it would not be forced to allow gay marriages , and britain promised that eu laws and courts would not prevail over its own judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso is unable to set up a new commission due to delays to the lisbon treaty stefan fule , czech minister for eu affairs , said the czech exemption would be a general one , comprising a comma and the words " czech republic " attached to " great britain " and " poland " in the treaty 's protocol .
recognizing that the chances that klaus might yield were slim , sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the czech cabinet set out to work on the wording of the exemption , which they hope to submit to the eu for approval at a summit next week .
european commission held up the eu has been waiting in suspense for klaus ' signature , the last step in the czech ratification process after local lawmakers approved the treaty earlier this year .
the impasse means that european commission chief jose manuel barroso , who was last month granted a second five-year term , is unable to nominate a new commission , because it is unclear what legal basis he should use .
the mandate of the current commission – the eu 's executive arm – expires at the end of october .
the body that draws up legislation impacting the lives of about half a billion europeans and policing the application of eu laws is likely to remain a lame duck until the future becomes clearer .
this may take some time as klaus has also linked his signature to a go-ahead from the top czech court , which is currently assessing the treaty 's compliance with the country 's constitution following a complaint filed by a group of eurosceptic senators .
like president klaus , the senators fear the treaty will give too much power to brussels and threaten czech sovereignty .
the court has said it will discuss the complaint in a public hearing on tuesday , but it is unclear how long the process might take .
concerns over further hurdles the president of the european parliament , jerzy buzek , said on friday he expected the lisbon reform treaty to come into force before the end of the year while admitting that challenges persisted .
" it 's my personal opinion : i can say that it 's a very high probability that we will have our lisbon treaty in place at the end of this year , " he said in an interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus recently conceded that the lisbon treaty is inevitable however , buzek voiced concerns an opt-out deal with the czechs could " bring problems in other member states " .
" we would like to have a solution proper for the czech republic and for president klaus to sign the lisbon treaty .
but of course we would n't like to have problems in other member states , " he said .

on friday , the staunch eurosceptic accepted a proposal by the swedish eu presidency to handle an opt-out from the treaty which he demands .
" this proposal corresponds to the president 's expectations and he can continue to work with it , " said klaus 's office .
critics of the czech president regard the demand as another attempt to delay the ratification .
however , friday 's statement by klaus 's office is the second glimmer of hope for the eu in a week , after the president suggested just days ago that he would ultimately sign .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , no matter how much some of us would want that , " he said last saturday , fueling hopes that the treaty might take effect soon .
exemption clause on property two weeks ago , klaus asked for an exemption from the treaty that would prevent ethnic germans forced out of his country after world war ii from reclaiming their property .
britain and poland won similar exemptions during the treaty negotiations in 2007 – catholic poland was assured it would not be forced to allow gay marriages , and britain promised that eu laws and courts would not prevail over its own judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso is unable to set up a new commission due to delays to the lisbon treaty stefan fule , czech minister for eu affairs , said the czech exemption would be a general one , comprising a comma and the words " czech republic " attached to " great britain " and " poland " in the treaty 's protocol .
recognizing that the chances that klaus might yield were slim , sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the czech cabinet set out to work on the wording of the exemption , which they hope to submit to the eu for approval at a summit next week .
european commission held up the eu has been waiting in suspense for klaus ' signature , the last step in the czech ratification process after local lawmakers approved the treaty earlier this year .
the impasse means that european commission chief jose manuel barroso , who was last month granted a second five-year term , is unable to nominate a new commission , because it is unclear what legal basis he should use .
the mandate of the current commission – the eu 's executive arm – expires at the end of october .
the body that draws up legislation impacting the lives of about half a billion europeans and policing the application of eu laws is likely to remain a lame duck until the future becomes clearer .
this may take some time as klaus has also linked his signature to a go-ahead from the top czech court , which is currently assessing the treaty 's compliance with the country 's constitution following a complaint filed by a group of eurosceptic senators .
like president klaus , the senators fear the treaty will give too much power to brussels and threaten czech sovereignty .
the court has said it will discuss the complaint in a public hearing on tuesday , but it is unclear how long the process might take .
concerns over further hurdles the president of the european parliament , jerzy buzek , said on friday he expected the lisbon reform treaty to come into force before the end of the year while admitting that challenges persisted .
" it 's my personal opinion : i can say that it 's a very high probability that we will have our lisbon treaty in place at the end of this year , " he said in an interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus recently conceded that the lisbon treaty is inevitable however , buzek voiced concerns an opt-out deal with the czechs could " bring problems in other member states " .
" we would like to have a solution proper for the czech republic and for president klaus to sign the lisbon treaty .
but of course we would n't like to have problems in other member states , " he said .
concerns that more countries may try to negotiate footnotes to the charter intensified last week after slovak prime minister robert fico said he may ask for an opt-out clause for his country if the czechs succeed. rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the agreement came after the parties struck a compromise on thorny financial issues . the late-night agreement paves the way for a new center-right government to take office next week , nearly a month after merkel 's conservatives and the free democrats won a parliamentary majority in the september 27 federal election .
just hours after reaching consensus , the coalition partners announced plans to cut taxes from january 1 next year . " the burden on families has to be lessened , the burden on companies and inheritance tax has to be reformed , " chancellor merkel said during a press conference in berlin on saturday . " we are aiming for growth , " she said , adding that the new government would focus on education and social cohesion .
" we have agreed a coalition program showing that we want to advance courageously into the future . " at the joint news conference with merkel , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , described the coalition agreement as " a great compass for our country . " sharing key cabinet posts the parties divided up key cabinet posts , with current interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the cdu being chosen to head the finance ministry , while the fdp 's westerwelle is to become foreign minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has earned a reputation as a hardliner when it comes to security policy the 67-year-old schaeuble , who has been bound to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 and has the reputation of being a hardliner on domestic security policy , was a surprise choice for the post of finance minister .
ahead of the september election , he indirectly criticized merkel 's pledge to pursue billions of euros in tax cuts , saying there was little room for them given germany 's strained finances .
now schaeuble will be charged with implementing those cuts against the backdrop of a deficit that is poised to rise to double european union limits next year .
news of his likely appointment sparked mixed reactions in germany on friday .
“ he 's an unknown entity when it comes to financial issues , " dennis snower , head of the kiel-based institute for economic research , told the reuters news agency .
" you ca n't make any predictions about his future financial policy based on what he 's done so far . "
" i think he 's a tough cookie and this is what will be needed , " carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing financial markets said .
" he is someone who would not be afraid of ruining his public image due to unpopular decision-making . "
thomas de maiziere , merkel 's trusted lieutenant as chief of staff , is set to take over schaeble 's job at the interior ministry .
free democrats bag prominent posts as widely expected , the post of foreign minister goes to fdp leader guido westerwelle .
the 47-year-old is the first openly gay leader of a mainstream political party in germany .
he has no foreign policy or government experience .
rainer bruederle , the fdp 's economics spokesman in the parliament for a decade , is set to replace karl-theodor zu guttenberg as economy minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the asian-born free democrat is a surprise pick the media-savvy guttenberg is set to head the defense ministry .
the 37-year-old , who is a member of the csu party , will be in charge of tackling the afghanistan mission which is deeply unpopular in germany .
the free democrats ' phillip roesler is a surprise pick for the post of health minister .
the 36-year-old , a rising star in the fdp , is currently the economy minister in the state of lower saxony and is reported to have led coalition negotiations on healthcare .
born in vietnam , roesler will germany 's first asian-born cabinet minister , also replacing guttenberg as the youngest member of the cabinet .
compromise on tax cuts the deal over the new government came after the conservative bloc and the free democrats managed to reconcile their promise of billions of euros in tax cuts with a separate pledge to get germany 's deficit – swollen by massive stimulus packages – back under control .
horst seehofer , head of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , admitted the final round of negotiations had been bogged down by financial issues .
" the financial issues at the end are always the most difficult and most exciting and you have to do that with great care , " he said , explaining why the talks stretched into the night .

that is more than the 20 billion euros merkel wanted but far less than 35 billion euros the fdp sought .
" that number is right – even if you did n't hear it from me first , " seehofer said .
" i 'm very pleased with this result , " he added , referring to the coalition agreement after the protracted talks .

according to the website of the daily telegraph newspaper , this included four percent who said they would " definitely " consider voting for the party , three percent who would " probably " consider it , and 15 percent who said they were " possible " bnp voters .
two-thirds of those polled said they would not consider voting for the party " under any circumstances , " while the rest were undecided .
more than half of those surveyed agreed with the bnp or thought the party " had a point " in wishing to " speak up for the interests of the indigenous , white british people ... which successive governments have done far too little to protect . "
griffin , who was a guest on bbc 's " question time , " was asked about his views on the holocaust , immigration , islam and homosexuality by a panel and members of the audience .
he has accused the broadcaster of setting a lynch mob on him in a controversial edition of the show , which was watched by a record 8.2 million people – almost three times the average number of viewers .
he demanded that the bbc give him a " second chance " to get his views across , and insisted that " the british people are aghast at the display of bias from the bbc . "
recruitment flood the far-right , anti-immigration party claimed friday that 3,000 people registered to sign up as members after the show in what it described as its " single biggest recruitment night . "
in addition , the bbc said it had received more than 350 complaints from viewers following the screening , the bulk of which accused the broadcaster of bias against the bnp and its leader . among those watching was jean-marie le pen , the leader of france 's far-right national front party , who in 1984 saw his support double overnight after appearing on a high-profile tv political discussion show .
in an interview with london 's evening standard newspaper on friday , le pen suggested that the bnp would receive a boost from the program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demonstrated outside bbc studios on the day of show " small fish will become big so long as god gives them life .
all political groups have started as marginal before becoming important , " he said . downing street said prime minister gordon brown did not watch question time but thanked justice secretary jack straw for appearing as the representative of the ruling labour party .
straw said the program had been " catastrophic " for griffin who had been " exposed as a fantasizing conspiracy theorist with some very unpleasant views and no moral compass . "
cabinet minister peter hain , a veteran anti-apartheid campaigner who fought unsuccessfully to try to stop griffin 's appearance , said : " this is exactly what i feared and warned about . " the bbc has handed the bnp the gift of the century on a plate and now we see the consequences , " he added .
" i 'm very angry about this . " mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 24.10.2009 new german government to shorten military conscription großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandatory service to be reduced germany 's new coalition government plans to reduce the time that young men must serve in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr .
the reaction from all sides has been swift and not all of it is positive . a deal to reduce the period of compulsory military service in germany was worked out between chancellor angela merkel 's incoming government coalition of the conservative union parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
as of january 1 , 2011 , military service will be reduced from nine months to six .
in its election platform , the fdp had called for an abolishment of conscription , however chancellor merkel prefers to keep some form of military service .
as it now stands , young men are obliged to do a compulsory tour of duty in the german military .
they can opt out or refuse , but then must perform " civilian service , " such as working in a hospital , nursing home or other civil organization .
under the new proposal , military service will consist of three months of basic training , two months of specialized training and one month of duty in specialist service units .
the reactions to the deal have been swift and varied .
while werner hoyer , a member of the fdp , called it a reasonable compromise , johannes kahrs , a leader in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the proposal pure nonsense .
" for military service to have any value at all , it should take at least nine months , " said kahrs in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper .
spd defense expert rainer arnold said that lowering the time from nine months to six relegated military service to " an introductory course " instead of a full meal .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mutual distrust kept conscription alive one of the main reasons for conscription and maintaining an army in readiness in the past was the deep mistrust that existed between the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and west germany .
service in the military for all men over the age of 18 became compulsory in 1956 .
the option of doing civil service instead of military service was introduced in 1961 .
over the years , the amount of time one had to serve in the military has been reduced .
in the 1960s it was 18 months .
after january 2002 that number had fallen to nine months .
in the former gdr , compulsory military service was introduced in 1962 .
there are currently about 250,000 men in the german army .
of that amount , 68,270 are conscripts and of those , 25,270 are soldiers who volunteered to remain a few months longer after their mandatory service was up .
future possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association another concern of reducing military service is the concomitant effect on civil service positions that have been filled by men who chose not to serve in the military .
some have said this loss of manpower to civil organizations would be harmful .
but peter tobiassen , the head of an organization that represents conscientious objectors , has said that there are three times as many applicants for those positions than there are jobs available .
while the cdu and csu want to maintain some sort of military conscription in the future , the idea of an all-voluntary military continues to circulate .
in an interview in july , germany 's incoming foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said that while conscription had its merits , it was a thing of the past .
ulrich kirsch , the chairman of the federal armed forces association said that the german army was " open to " the idea of an all voluntary force , but more research was needed .
in any event , kirsch noted that changing to an all voluntary army would require amending the constitution , which would take a two-thirds majority , and that that was not going to happen in the near future. av / dpa / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this remains the dream of three stars who left germany in search of the big prize . whatever a player may tell you about his priorities , the champions league is the holy grail .
to hold the hugely iconic trophy known fondly as " old big ears " aloft tells the world that you have reached the pinnacle of the european game , that you have battled and beaten some of the best clubs in the world . domestic success bestows great honor on a player but being crowned european champion is not only in a different league , it ’ s in a completely different kingdom . reaching the top in your domestic league does n't always guarantee that you can make that leap to the next stage .
you can be playing for the very best , have league titles and cups threatening to collapse your trophy cabinet , and yet still have that grecian urn on steroids missing from your collection . just ask michael ballack .
in may of 2002 , a fresh-faced ballack was 90 minutes away from lifting " old big ears " as the rising star of a hugely over-achieving bayer leverkusen team .
while bayer went on to blow a league title which was theirs to lose , they were probably the best team in the bundesliga that season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's move to bayern failed to bring him the cup he covets it was with that knowledge that ballack and co. faced real madrid in the european cup final . however , a stroke of zinedine zidane genius added a dose of reality to bayer 's pretensions , snatched the title away from ballack and imploded leverkusen 's season in one fierce volley . maybe ballack left for bayern munich later that year in search of the bundesliga title that so cruelly eluded him at bayer leverkusen .
it 's more likely , however , that he joined bayern – a team that lifted the champions league trophy only a year before – because of what he saw as a better chance to win the european cup . ironically , bayer leverkusen went further in europe than bayern in ballack 's first season in bavaria , as munich failed to make it past the first group stage .
ballack got closer the following year when bayern reached the last 16 , again losing to real madrid . he went even closer in 2005 when bayern lost to chelsea in the quarter-final .
but by 2006 , when bayern started to take backwards steps in europe , it became clear that ballack had to leave if he wanted to become a european champion . to the island in joining chelsea , a team which had just secured back-to-back english premiership titles and reached european semi-finals in the previous two seasons , ballack saw a real chance to make his dream a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and chelsea were one spot-kick away from glory chelsea were on the cusp of european glory – everyone believed it was only a matter of time -lrb- not to mention money -rrb- .
in his first season with the blues , however , chelsea again stuttered at the semi-final stage .
the following year , however , presented ballack with another chance to come out on top in a final .
again , he ended up on the losing side but as it came after a cruel penalty shoot-out , an optimist could say it was closest he 'd come to date . last season , it was disappointment again at the semi-final stage as chelsea lost to eventual champions barcelona . this year , even at this early stage , chelsea again look like they will be contenders , winning three games out of three in their group stage , despite not playing their best .
ballack seems to fit into new coach carlo ancelotti 's team plan and so if things progress and chelsea advance , ballack 's move to london in search of european success may yet bear fruit . bremen to juventus but ballack is not the only star to leave the bundesliga in search of europe 's biggest prize . despite being an integral part of a werder bremen team which played exciting soccer and looked as though they had the future potential to capture silverware at home and abroad , brazilian playmaker diego left the german club for juventus in may this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's move has improved his chances of euro success becoming a serie a champion has as much cache as winning any domestic league but it remains unlikely that diego purely had designs on the scudetto when he joined the blanconeri .
diego may have increased his chances of becoming a league champion by joining juventus , with werder bremen seemingly stalled as exciting also-rans , but his chances of winning the champions league rose exponentially when he put pen to paper in turin in may . bremen had qualified for the champions league in each of the three seasons that diego featured but their shortcomings were frequently exposed .
in the three champions league campaigns of diego ’ s werder career , bremen managed to finish third in their qualifying group in the first two , dropping into the uefa cup as a result , but failed to qualify through their disappointing bundesliga placing in his final season . this year , as a juventus player , diego is performing in a team which has ambitions in the champions league way beyond that which the brazilian achieved with werder . two draws and one win from three games may not be form to set the heart a flutter but juve sit in second place sandwiched between bayern munich in third and group leaders bordeaux .
last-placed club maccabi haifa aside , group a looks like a tough ride .
should juventus qualify , diego ’ s dream may yet live on a little longer . off in search of silver one other player who left the bundesliga with " old big ears " in mind is christoph metzelder . in the german defender 's seven year stint at borussia dortmund , a solitary bundesliga title won in his second season with the club was as good as it was ever going to get and although it may have been a surprise that he ended up at real madrid , it was no shock that metzelder decided to move on after so many barren years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzelder may have signed on to win but will he play ?
again , joining a club with the standing of real madrid certainly raised metzelder 's chances of domestic silverware – which he achieved with a spanish league title and supercup medal in his first season – but signing for the record holders for the most european cup wins must have figured in the defender 's reasoning for swapping the ruhrgebiet for the spanish capital . since leaving for madrid in 2007 , however los blancos have failed to live up to those famous sides which fill the pages of the record books .
in his first season , real were undone by as roma in the first knock-out round and were hammered at the same stage by liverpool the following year .
this year , however , despite losing to ac milan , real madrid have looked like a tasty proposition with the embarrassment of riches coach manuel pelligrini has at his disposal . this , however , may be a hindrance to metzelder personally .
while the hugely talented squad may win the 2009/10 champions league , whether metzelder plays in the team is another matter . moving to a club capable of winning the champions league is one thing .
actually playing for that team is another . author : nick amies editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this remains the dream of three stars who left germany in search of the big prize . whatever a player may tell you about his priorities , the champions league is the holy grail .
to hold the hugely iconic trophy known fondly as " old big ears " aloft tells the world that you have reached the pinnacle of the european game , that you have battled and beaten some of the best clubs in the world . domestic success bestows great honor on a player but being crowned european champion is not only in a different league , it ’ s in a completely different kingdom . reaching the top in your domestic league does n't always guarantee that you can make that leap to the next stage .
you can be playing for the very best , have league titles and cups threatening to collapse your trophy cabinet , and yet still have that grecian urn on steroids missing from your collection . just ask michael ballack .
in may of 2002 , a fresh-faced ballack was 90 minutes away from lifting " old big ears " as the rising star of a hugely over-achieving bayer leverkusen team .
while bayer went on to blow a league title which was theirs to lose , they were probably the best team in the bundesliga that season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's move to bayern failed to bring him the cup he covets it was with that knowledge that ballack and co. faced real madrid in the european cup final . however , a stroke of zinedine zidane genius added a dose of reality to bayer 's pretensions , snatched the title away from ballack and imploded leverkusen 's season in one fierce volley . maybe ballack left for bayern munich later that year in search of the bundesliga title that so cruelly eluded him at bayer leverkusen .
it 's more likely , however , that he joined bayern – a team that lifted the champions league trophy only a year before – because of what he saw as a better chance to win the european cup . ironically , bayer leverkusen went further in europe than bayern in ballack 's first season in bavaria , as munich failed to make it past the first group stage .
ballack got closer the following year when bayern reached the last 16 , again losing to real madrid . he went even closer in 2005 when bayern lost to chelsea in the quarter-final .
but by 2006 , when bayern started to take backwards steps in europe , it became clear that ballack had to leave if he wanted to become a european champion . to the island in joining chelsea , a team which had just secured back-to-back english premiership titles and reached european semi-finals in the previous two seasons , ballack saw a real chance to make his dream a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and chelsea were one spot-kick away from glory chelsea were on the cusp of european glory – everyone believed it was only a matter of time -lrb- not to mention money -rrb- .
in his first season with the blues , however , chelsea again stuttered at the semi-final stage .
the following year , however , presented ballack with another chance to come out on top in a final .
again , he ended up on the losing side but as it came after a cruel penalty shoot-out , an optimist could say it was closest he 'd come to date . last season , it was disappointment again at the semi-final stage as chelsea lost to eventual champions barcelona . this year , even at this early stage , chelsea again look like they will be contenders , winning three games out of three in their group stage , despite not playing their best .

this remains the dream of three stars who left germany in search of the big prize . whatever a player may tell you about his priorities , the champions league is the holy grail .
to hold the hugely iconic trophy known fondly as " old big ears " aloft tells the world that you have reached the pinnacle of the european game , that you have battled and beaten some of the best clubs in the world . domestic success bestows great honor on a player but being crowned european champion is not only in a different league , it ’ s in a completely different kingdom . reaching the top in your domestic league does n't always guarantee that you can make that leap to the next stage .
you can be playing for the very best , have league titles and cups threatening to collapse your trophy cabinet , and yet still have that grecian urn on steroids missing from your collection . just ask michael ballack .
in may of 2002 , a fresh-faced ballack was 90 minutes away from lifting " old big ears " as the rising star of a hugely over-achieving bayer leverkusen team .
while bayer went on to blow a league title which was theirs to lose , they were probably the best team in the bundesliga that season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's move to bayern failed to bring him the cup he covets it was with that knowledge that ballack and co. faced real madrid in the european cup final . however , a stroke of zinedine zidane genius added a dose of reality to bayer 's pretensions , snatched the title away from ballack and imploded leverkusen 's season in one fierce volley . maybe ballack left for bayern munich later that year in search of the bundesliga title that so cruelly eluded him at bayer leverkusen .
it 's more likely , however , that he joined bayern – a team that lifted the champions league trophy only a year before – because of what he saw as a better chance to win the european cup . ironically , bayer leverkusen went further in europe than bayern in ballack 's first season in bavaria , as munich failed to make it past the first group stage .
ballack got closer the following year when bayern reached the last 16 , again losing to real madrid . he went even closer in 2005 when bayern lost to chelsea in the quarter-final .
but by 2006 , when bayern started to take backwards steps in europe , it became clear that ballack had to leave if he wanted to become a european champion . to the island in joining chelsea , a team which had just secured back-to-back english premiership titles and reached european semi-finals in the previous two seasons , ballack saw a real chance to make his dream a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and chelsea were one spot-kick away from glory chelsea were on the cusp of european glory – everyone believed it was only a matter of time -lrb- not to mention money -rrb- .
in his first season with the blues , however , chelsea again stuttered at the semi-final stage .
the following year , however , presented ballack with another chance to come out on top in a final .
again , he ended up on the losing side but as it came after a cruel penalty shoot-out , an optimist could say it was closest he 'd come to date . last season , it was disappointment again at the semi-final stage as chelsea lost to eventual champions barcelona . this year , even at this early stage , chelsea again look like they will be contenders , winning three games out of three in their group stage , despite not playing their best .
ballack seems to fit into new coach carlo ancelotti 's team plan and so if things progress and chelsea advance , ballack 's move to london in search of european success may yet bear fruit . bremen to juventus but ballack is not the only star to leave the bundesliga in search of europe 's biggest prize . despite being an integral part of a werder bremen team which played exciting soccer and looked as though they had the future potential to capture silverware at home and abroad , brazilian playmaker diego left the german club for juventus in may this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's move has improved his chances of euro success becoming a serie a champion has as much cache as winning any domestic league but it remains unlikely that diego purely had designs on the scudetto when he joined the blanconeri .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 24.10.2009 jewish scholar challenged tradition with creation of unique library großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warburg examined the influence of the antiquity on later works a library established by hamburg-born jewish art historian aby m. warburg narrowly escaped destruction by the nazis to become one of the most significant book collections in europe to this day . he was " a jew by birth , a florentine in spirit , and a hamburger at heart . " that 's how art historian aby warburg saw himself in his own words . one of his most outstanding achievements was the founding of the warburg cultural studies library , which was officially opened in 1926 .
with four levels , the library was not exactly small , but it was designed in a space-saving manner .
narrow corridors and low doors awaited the visitors behind a red-brick facade .
the library 's infrastructure included the most modern technology of the time for transporting the books from one place to another , including special conveyor belts .
there were 26 telephone connections , a pneumatic tube , and an elevator for books and for staff .
a costly blank check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warburg was a great achiever , though plagued by mental instability warburg financed his library through his father 's banking firm , and later through that of his brother 's , who had moved to the united states .
" when aby was 13 years old , he offered me his firstborn rights , " said warburg 's brother , max .
" since he was the oldest , he was meant to go into the family business .
i was 12 at the time and agreed to buy his firstborn rights .
but he asked me to promise that i would always buy him all the books that he needed .
and , after short consideration , i agreed . "
in this way , warburg 's brother closed the deal - without realizing that this " exchange " involved writing out what was probably the most expensive blank check of his life .
behind the achievement of the library , there was a fragile human being .
with his poor health and bouts of depression , warburg from time to time underwent psychotherapy .
in 1918 , at the end of world war i , he suffered a mental breakdown - a culmination of his phobias , obsessions and delusions .
at the same time , however , he managed to gain widespread acclaim as an art historian , private scholar and researcher .
a non-traditional approach warburg was not interested in a purely aesthetic approach to art history .
his personal focus was the debate over the legacy of antiquity , which he approached with his portrayal of sandro botticelli 's works , the art of florentine painter , works by albrecht duerer and ancient pagan prophecies in written and visual representations .
" one day , i 'm sitting in the library 's lecture room with a newspaper from 1915 , " said rene drommert , a student librarian at the warburg house in the 1920s .
" suddenly , aby warburg appears and says , ' what are you doing there , mr drommert ? '
and i say : ' i 'm interested in the world war i era . '
warburg then bends over the desk and points to an advertisement offering flour and potatoes in exchange for a carpet .
and he says : ' naturally , you have the include things like this to get a good idea of the cultural and social life at the time . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for warburg , art was not just aesthetics , but the way people lived in warburg 's lifetime , the cultural studies library was considered to be an intellectual center in the weimar republic - and it remained that way till after his death on october 26 , 1929 .
many renowned scholars worked in the library 's reading room , including ernst cassirer , erwin panofsky and albert einstein .
according to charles hope , art historian and director of the warburg institute in london , what stands out is the prevalence of jewish scholars at the library .
" in my opinion , these people did not think that their jewishness had a large influence on their scholarliness , " said hope .
" their jewish background was of limited importance to them . "
second start in england this was until the rise of the nazi party threatened the library 's survival and forced it to move to london , which it did on december 12 , 1933 .
thanks to generous support on the british side , the library was preserved .
today , with 350,000 books , it is called the warburg institute and it is still one of the most significant humanities-oriented book collections in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cultural studies library is one of europe 's most important book collections the library gained its good reputation thanks to its unusual collection of books , as well as its interdisciplinary classification system , which links together very different subject areas : psychology and anthropology , theater , celebration and music , astrology and astronomy , chemistry and mathematics .
warburg himself had arranged the books in an interdisciplinary manner , and even the library 's architectural details reflected his educational motivations .
in the center was an oval reading and lecture room , because " warburg wanted an elliptical shape , as he believed that it helps people stay alert , whereas a circular room makes you sleepy , " according to hamburg art historian and warburg scholar martin warnke .
" also , it was because astronomer johannes kepler had proved that the earth and other planets followed an elliptical orbit , " said warnke .

" that 's how art historian aby warburg saw himself in his own words . one of his most outstanding achievements was the founding of the warburg cultural studies library , which was officially opened in 1926 .
with four levels , the library was not exactly small , but it was designed in a space-saving manner .
narrow corridors and low doors awaited the visitors behind a red-brick facade .
the library 's infrastructure included the most modern technology of the time for transporting the books from one place to another , including special conveyor belts .
there were 26 telephone connections , a pneumatic tube , and an elevator for books and for staff .

in this way , warburg 's brother closed the deal - without realizing that this " exchange " involved writing out what was probably the most expensive blank check of his life .
behind the achievement of the library , there was a fragile human being .
with his poor health and bouts of depression , warburg from time to time underwent psychotherapy .

at the same time , however , he managed to gain widespread acclaim as an art historian , private scholar and researcher .
a non-traditional approach warburg was not interested in a purely aesthetic approach to art history .
his personal focus was the debate over the legacy of antiquity , which he approached with his portrayal of sandro botticelli 's works , the art of florentine painter , works by albrecht duerer and ancient pagan prophecies in written and visual representations .
" one day , i 'm sitting in the library 's lecture room with a newspaper from 1915 , " said rene drommert , a student librarian at the warburg house in the 1920s .

this remains the dream of three stars who left germany in search of the big prize . whatever a player may tell you about his priorities , the champions league is the holy grail .
to hold the hugely iconic trophy known fondly as " old big ears " aloft tells the world that you have reached the pinnacle of the european game , that you have battled and beaten some of the best clubs in the world . domestic success bestows great honor on a player but being crowned european champion is not only in a different league , it ’ s in a completely different kingdom . reaching the top in your domestic league does n't always guarantee that you can make that leap to the next stage .
you can be playing for the very best , have league titles and cups threatening to collapse your trophy cabinet , and yet still have that grecian urn on steroids missing from your collection . just ask michael ballack .
in may of 2002 , a fresh-faced ballack was 90 minutes away from lifting " old big ears " as the rising star of a hugely over-achieving bayer leverkusen team .
while bayer went on to blow a league title which was theirs to lose , they were probably the best team in the bundesliga that season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's move to bayern failed to bring him the cup he covets it was with that knowledge that ballack and co. faced real madrid in the european cup final . however , a stroke of zinedine zidane genius added a dose of reality to bayer 's pretensions , snatched the title away from ballack and imploded leverkusen 's season in one fierce volley . maybe ballack left for bayern munich later that year in search of the bundesliga title that so cruelly eluded him at bayer leverkusen .
it 's more likely , however , that he joined bayern – a team that lifted the champions league trophy only a year before – because of what he saw as a better chance to win the european cup . ironically , bayer leverkusen went further in europe than bayern in ballack 's first season in bavaria , as munich failed to make it past the first group stage .
ballack got closer the following year when bayern reached the last 16 , again losing to real madrid . he went even closer in 2005 when bayern lost to chelsea in the quarter-final .
but by 2006 , when bayern started to take backwards steps in europe , it became clear that ballack had to leave if he wanted to become a european champion . to the island in joining chelsea , a team which had just secured back-to-back english premiership titles and reached european semi-finals in the previous two seasons , ballack saw a real chance to make his dream a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and chelsea were one spot-kick away from glory chelsea were on the cusp of european glory – everyone believed it was only a matter of time -lrb- not to mention money -rrb- .
in his first season with the blues , however , chelsea again stuttered at the semi-final stage .
the following year , however , presented ballack with another chance to come out on top in a final .
again , he ended up on the losing side but as it came after a cruel penalty shoot-out , an optimist could say it was closest he 'd come to date . last season , it was disappointment again at the semi-final stage as chelsea lost to eventual champions barcelona . this year , even at this early stage , chelsea again look like they will be contenders , winning three games out of three in their group stage , despite not playing their best .
ballack seems to fit into new coach carlo ancelotti 's team plan and so if things progress and chelsea advance , ballack 's move to london in search of european success may yet bear fruit . bremen to juventus but ballack is not the only star to leave the bundesliga in search of europe 's biggest prize . despite being an integral part of a werder bremen team which played exciting soccer and looked as though they had the future potential to capture silverware at home and abroad , brazilian playmaker diego left the german club for juventus in may this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's move has improved his chances of euro success becoming a serie a champion has as much cache as winning any domestic league but it remains unlikely that diego purely had designs on the scudetto when he joined the blanconeri .
diego may have increased his chances of becoming a league champion by joining juventus , with werder bremen seemingly stalled as exciting also-rans , but his chances of winning the champions league rose exponentially when he put pen to paper in turin in may . bremen had qualified for the champions league in each of the three seasons that diego featured but their shortcomings were frequently exposed .
in the three champions league campaigns of diego ’ s werder career , bremen managed to finish third in their qualifying group in the first two , dropping into the uefa cup as a result , but failed to qualify through their disappointing bundesliga placing in his final season . this year , as a juventus player , diego is performing in a team which has ambitions in the champions league way beyond that which the brazilian achieved with werder . two draws and one win from three games may not be form to set the heart a flutter but juve sit in second place sandwiched between bayern munich in third and group leaders bordeaux .
last-placed club maccabi haifa aside , group a looks like a tough ride .
should juventus qualify , diego ’ s dream may yet live on a little longer . off in search of silver one other player who left the bundesliga with " old big ears " in mind is christoph metzelder . in the german defender 's seven year stint at borussia dortmund , a solitary bundesliga title won in his second season with the club was as good as it was ever going to get and although it may have been a surprise that he ended up at real madrid , it was no shock that metzelder decided to move on after so many barren years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzelder may have signed on to win but will he play ?
again , joining a club with the standing of real madrid certainly raised metzelder 's chances of domestic silverware – which he achieved with a spanish league title and supercup medal in his first season – but signing for the record holders for the most european cup wins must have figured in the defender 's reasoning for swapping the ruhrgebiet for the spanish capital . since leaving for madrid in 2007 , however los blancos have failed to live up to those famous sides which fill the pages of the record books .
in his first season , real were undone by as roma in the first knock-out round and were hammered at the same stage by liverpool the following year .
this year , however , despite losing to ac milan , real madrid have looked like a tasty proposition with the embarrassment of riches coach manuel pelligrini has at his disposal . this , however , may be a hindrance to metzelder personally .
while the hugely talented squad may win the 2009/10 champions league , whether metzelder plays in the team is another matter . moving to a club capable of winning the champions league is one thing .
actually playing for that team is another . author : nick amies editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a non-traditional approach warburg was not interested in a purely aesthetic approach to art history .
his personal focus was the debate over the legacy of antiquity , which he approached with his portrayal of sandro botticelli 's works , the art of florentine painter , works by albrecht duerer and ancient pagan prophecies in written and visual representations .
" one day , i 'm sitting in the library 's lecture room with a newspaper from 1915 , " said rene drommert , a student librarian at the warburg house in the 1920s .
" suddenly , aby warburg appears and says , ' what are you doing there , mr drommert ? '
and i say : ' i 'm interested in the world war i era . '
warburg then bends over the desk and points to an advertisement offering flour and potatoes in exchange for a carpet .
and he says : ' naturally , you have the include things like this to get a good idea of the cultural and social life at the time . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for warburg , art was not just aesthetics , but the way people lived in warburg 's lifetime , the cultural studies library was considered to be an intellectual center in the weimar republic - and it remained that way till after his death on october 26 , 1929 .
many renowned scholars worked in the library 's reading room , including ernst cassirer , erwin panofsky and albert einstein .
according to charles hope , art historian and director of the warburg institute in london , what stands out is the prevalence of jewish scholars at the library .
" in my opinion , these people did not think that their jewishness had a large influence on their scholarliness , " said hope .
" their jewish background was of limited importance to them . "
second start in england this was until the rise of the nazi party threatened the library 's survival and forced it to move to london , which it did on december 12 , 1933 .
thanks to generous support on the british side , the library was preserved .
today , with 350,000 books , it is called the warburg institute and it is still one of the most significant humanities-oriented book collections in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cultural studies library is one of europe 's most important book collections the library gained its good reputation thanks to its unusual collection of books , as well as its interdisciplinary classification system , which links together very different subject areas : psychology and anthropology , theater , celebration and music , astrology and astronomy , chemistry and mathematics .
warburg himself had arranged the books in an interdisciplinary manner , and even the library 's architectural details reflected his educational motivations .
in the center was an oval reading and lecture room , because " warburg wanted an elliptical shape , as he believed that it helps people stay alert , whereas a circular room makes you sleepy , " according to hamburg art historian and warburg scholar martin warnke .
" also , it was because astronomer johannes kepler had proved that the earth and other planets followed an elliptical orbit , " said warnke .

this remains the dream of three stars who left germany in search of the big prize . whatever a player may tell you about his priorities , the champions league is the holy grail .
to hold the hugely iconic trophy known fondly as " old big ears " aloft tells the world that you have reached the pinnacle of the european game , that you have battled and beaten some of the best clubs in the world . domestic success bestows great honor on a player but being crowned european champion is not only in a different league , it ’ s in a completely different kingdom . reaching the top in your domestic league does n't always guarantee that you can make that leap to the next stage .
you can be playing for the very best , have league titles and cups threatening to collapse your trophy cabinet , and yet still have that grecian urn on steroids missing from your collection . just ask michael ballack .
in may of 2002 , a fresh-faced ballack was 90 minutes away from lifting " old big ears " as the rising star of a hugely over-achieving bayer leverkusen team .
while bayer went on to blow a league title which was theirs to lose , they were probably the best team in the bundesliga that season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's move to bayern failed to bring him the cup he covets it was with that knowledge that ballack and co. faced real madrid in the european cup final . however , a stroke of zinedine zidane genius added a dose of reality to bayer 's pretensions , snatched the title away from ballack and imploded leverkusen 's season in one fierce volley . maybe ballack left for bayern munich later that year in search of the bundesliga title that so cruelly eluded him at bayer leverkusen .
it 's more likely , however , that he joined bayern – a team that lifted the champions league trophy only a year before – because of what he saw as a better chance to win the european cup . ironically , bayer leverkusen went further in europe than bayern in ballack 's first season in bavaria , as munich failed to make it past the first group stage .
ballack got closer the following year when bayern reached the last 16 , again losing to real madrid . he went even closer in 2005 when bayern lost to chelsea in the quarter-final .
but by 2006 , when bayern started to take backwards steps in europe , it became clear that ballack had to leave if he wanted to become a european champion . to the island in joining chelsea , a team which had just secured back-to-back english premiership titles and reached european semi-finals in the previous two seasons , ballack saw a real chance to make his dream a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and chelsea were one spot-kick away from glory chelsea were on the cusp of european glory – everyone believed it was only a matter of time -lrb- not to mention money -rrb- .
in his first season with the blues , however , chelsea again stuttered at the semi-final stage .
the following year , however , presented ballack with another chance to come out on top in a final .
again , he ended up on the losing side but as it came after a cruel penalty shoot-out , an optimist could say it was closest he 'd come to date . last season , it was disappointment again at the semi-final stage as chelsea lost to eventual champions barcelona . this year , even at this early stage , chelsea again look like they will be contenders , winning three games out of three in their group stage , despite not playing their best .
ballack seems to fit into new coach carlo ancelotti 's team plan and so if things progress and chelsea advance , ballack 's move to london in search of european success may yet bear fruit . bremen to juventus but ballack is not the only star to leave the bundesliga in search of europe 's biggest prize . despite being an integral part of a werder bremen team which played exciting soccer and looked as though they had the future potential to capture silverware at home and abroad , brazilian playmaker diego left the german club for juventus in may this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's move has improved his chances of euro success becoming a serie a champion has as much cache as winning any domestic league but it remains unlikely that diego purely had designs on the scudetto when he joined the blanconeri .
diego may have increased his chances of becoming a league champion by joining juventus , with werder bremen seemingly stalled as exciting also-rans , but his chances of winning the champions league rose exponentially when he put pen to paper in turin in may . bremen had qualified for the champions league in each of the three seasons that diego featured but their shortcomings were frequently exposed .
in the three champions league campaigns of diego ’ s werder career , bremen managed to finish third in their qualifying group in the first two , dropping into the uefa cup as a result , but failed to qualify through their disappointing bundesliga placing in his final season . this year , as a juventus player , diego is performing in a team which has ambitions in the champions league way beyond that which the brazilian achieved with werder . two draws and one win from three games may not be form to set the heart a flutter but juve sit in second place sandwiched between bayern munich in third and group leaders bordeaux .
last-placed club maccabi haifa aside , group a looks like a tough ride .
should juventus qualify , diego ’ s dream may yet live on a little longer . off in search of silver one other player who left the bundesliga with " old big ears " in mind is christoph metzelder . in the german defender 's seven year stint at borussia dortmund , a solitary bundesliga title won in his second season with the club was as good as it was ever going to get and although it may have been a surprise that he ended up at real madrid , it was no shock that metzelder decided to move on after so many barren years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzelder may have signed on to win but will he play ?
again , joining a club with the standing of real madrid certainly raised metzelder 's chances of domestic silverware – which he achieved with a spanish league title and supercup medal in his first season – but signing for the record holders for the most european cup wins must have figured in the defender 's reasoning for swapping the ruhrgebiet for the spanish capital . since leaving for madrid in 2007 , however los blancos have failed to live up to those famous sides which fill the pages of the record books .
in his first season , real were undone by as roma in the first knock-out round and were hammered at the same stage by liverpool the following year .
this year , however , despite losing to ac milan , real madrid have looked like a tasty proposition with the embarrassment of riches coach manuel pelligrini has at his disposal . this , however , may be a hindrance to metzelder personally .
while the hugely talented squad may win the 2009/10 champions league , whether metzelder plays in the team is another matter . moving to a club capable of winning the champions league is one thing .
actually playing for that team is another . author : nick amies editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this remains the dream of three stars who left germany in search of the big prize . whatever a player may tell you about his priorities , the champions league is the holy grail .
to hold the hugely iconic trophy known fondly as " old big ears " aloft tells the world that you have reached the pinnacle of the european game , that you have battled and beaten some of the best clubs in the world . domestic success bestows great honor on a player but being crowned european champion is not only in a different league , it ’ s in a completely different kingdom . reaching the top in your domestic league does n't always guarantee that you can make that leap to the next stage .
you can be playing for the very best , have league titles and cups threatening to collapse your trophy cabinet , and yet still have that grecian urn on steroids missing from your collection . just ask michael ballack .
in may of 2002 , a fresh-faced ballack was 90 minutes away from lifting " old big ears " as the rising star of a hugely over-achieving bayer leverkusen team .
while bayer went on to blow a league title which was theirs to lose , they were probably the best team in the bundesliga that season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's move to bayern failed to bring him the cup he covets it was with that knowledge that ballack and co. faced real madrid in the european cup final . however , a stroke of zinedine zidane genius added a dose of reality to bayer 's pretensions , snatched the title away from ballack and imploded leverkusen 's season in one fierce volley . maybe ballack left for bayern munich later that year in search of the bundesliga title that so cruelly eluded him at bayer leverkusen .
it 's more likely , however , that he joined bayern – a team that lifted the champions league trophy only a year before – because of what he saw as a better chance to win the european cup . ironically , bayer leverkusen went further in europe than bayern in ballack 's first season in bavaria , as munich failed to make it past the first group stage .
ballack got closer the following year when bayern reached the last 16 , again losing to real madrid . he went even closer in 2005 when bayern lost to chelsea in the quarter-final .
but by 2006 , when bayern started to take backwards steps in europe , it became clear that ballack had to leave if he wanted to become a european champion . to the island in joining chelsea , a team which had just secured back-to-back english premiership titles and reached european semi-finals in the previous two seasons , ballack saw a real chance to make his dream a reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack and chelsea were one spot-kick away from glory chelsea were on the cusp of european glory – everyone believed it was only a matter of time -lrb- not to mention money -rrb- .
in his first season with the blues , however , chelsea again stuttered at the semi-final stage .
the following year , however , presented ballack with another chance to come out on top in a final .
again , he ended up on the losing side but as it came after a cruel penalty shoot-out , an optimist could say it was closest he 'd come to date . last season , it was disappointment again at the semi-final stage as chelsea lost to eventual champions barcelona . this year , even at this early stage , chelsea again look like they will be contenders , winning three games out of three in their group stage , despite not playing their best .
ballack seems to fit into new coach carlo ancelotti 's team plan and so if things progress and chelsea advance , ballack 's move to london in search of european success may yet bear fruit . bremen to juventus but ballack is not the only star to leave the bundesliga in search of europe 's biggest prize . despite being an integral part of a werder bremen team which played exciting soccer and looked as though they had the future potential to capture silverware at home and abroad , brazilian playmaker diego left the german club for juventus in may this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's move has improved his chances of euro success becoming a serie a champion has as much cache as winning any domestic league but it remains unlikely that diego purely had designs on the scudetto when he joined the blanconeri .
diego may have increased his chances of becoming a league champion by joining juventus , with werder bremen seemingly stalled as exciting also-rans , but his chances of winning the champions league rose exponentially when he put pen to paper in turin in may . bremen had qualified for the champions league in each of the three seasons that diego featured but their shortcomings were frequently exposed .
in the three champions league campaigns of diego ’ s werder career , bremen managed to finish third in their qualifying group in the first two , dropping into the uefa cup as a result , but failed to qualify through their disappointing bundesliga placing in his final season . this year , as a juventus player , diego is performing in a team which has ambitions in the champions league way beyond that which the brazilian achieved with werder . two draws and one win from three games may not be form to set the heart a flutter but juve sit in second place sandwiched between bayern munich in third and group leaders bordeaux .
last-placed club maccabi haifa aside , group a looks like a tough ride .
should juventus qualify , diego ’ s dream may yet live on a little longer . off in search of silver one other player who left the bundesliga with " old big ears " in mind is christoph metzelder . in the german defender 's seven year stint at borussia dortmund , a solitary bundesliga title won in his second season with the club was as good as it was ever going to get and although it may have been a surprise that he ended up at real madrid , it was no shock that metzelder decided to move on after so many barren years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzelder may have signed on to win but will he play ?

" that 's how art historian aby warburg saw himself in his own words . one of his most outstanding achievements was the founding of the warburg cultural studies library , which was officially opened in 1926 .
with four levels , the library was not exactly small , but it was designed in a space-saving manner .
narrow corridors and low doors awaited the visitors behind a red-brick facade .
the library 's infrastructure included the most modern technology of the time for transporting the books from one place to another , including special conveyor belts .
there were 26 telephone connections , a pneumatic tube , and an elevator for books and for staff .
a costly blank check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warburg was a great achiever , though plagued by mental instability warburg financed his library through his father 's banking firm , and later through that of his brother 's , who had moved to the united states .
" when aby was 13 years old , he offered me his firstborn rights , " said warburg 's brother , max .
" since he was the oldest , he was meant to go into the family business .
i was 12 at the time and agreed to buy his firstborn rights .
but he asked me to promise that i would always buy him all the books that he needed .
and , after short consideration , i agreed . "
in this way , warburg 's brother closed the deal - without realizing that this " exchange " involved writing out what was probably the most expensive blank check of his life .
behind the achievement of the library , there was a fragile human being .
with his poor health and bouts of depression , warburg from time to time underwent psychotherapy .
in 1918 , at the end of world war i , he suffered a mental breakdown - a culmination of his phobias , obsessions and delusions .
at the same time , however , he managed to gain widespread acclaim as an art historian , private scholar and researcher .
a non-traditional approach warburg was not interested in a purely aesthetic approach to art history .
his personal focus was the debate over the legacy of antiquity , which he approached with his portrayal of sandro botticelli 's works , the art of florentine painter , works by albrecht duerer and ancient pagan prophecies in written and visual representations .
" one day , i 'm sitting in the library 's lecture room with a newspaper from 1915 , " said rene drommert , a student librarian at the warburg house in the 1920s .
" suddenly , aby warburg appears and says , ' what are you doing there , mr drommert ? '
and i say : ' i 'm interested in the world war i era . '
warburg then bends over the desk and points to an advertisement offering flour and potatoes in exchange for a carpet .
and he says : ' naturally , you have the include things like this to get a good idea of the cultural and social life at the time . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for warburg , art was not just aesthetics , but the way people lived in warburg 's lifetime , the cultural studies library was considered to be an intellectual center in the weimar republic - and it remained that way till after his death on october 26 , 1929 .
many renowned scholars worked in the library 's reading room , including ernst cassirer , erwin panofsky and albert einstein .
according to charles hope , art historian and director of the warburg institute in london , what stands out is the prevalence of jewish scholars at the library .

the reaction from all sides has been swift and not all of it is positive . a deal to reduce the period of compulsory military service in germany was worked out between chancellor angela merkel 's incoming government coalition of the conservative union parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
as of january 1 , 2011 , military service will be reduced from nine months to six .
in its election platform , the fdp had called for an abolishment of conscription , however chancellor merkel prefers to keep some form of military service .
as it now stands , young men are obliged to do a compulsory tour of duty in the german military .
they can opt out or refuse , but then must perform " civilian service , " such as working in a hospital , nursing home or other civil organization .
under the new proposal , military service will consist of three months of basic training , two months of specialized training and one month of duty in specialist service units .
the reactions to the deal have been swift and varied .
while werner hoyer , a member of the fdp , called it a reasonable compromise , johannes kahrs , a leader in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the proposal pure nonsense .
" for military service to have any value at all , it should take at least nine months , " said kahrs in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper .
spd defense expert rainer arnold said that lowering the time from nine months to six relegated military service to " an introductory course " instead of a full meal .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mutual distrust kept conscription alive one of the main reasons for conscription and maintaining an army in readiness in the past was the deep mistrust that existed between the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and west germany .
service in the military for all men over the age of 18 became compulsory in 1956 .
the option of doing civil service instead of military service was introduced in 1961 .
over the years , the amount of time one had to serve in the military has been reduced .
in the 1960s it was 18 months .
after january 2002 that number had fallen to nine months .
in the former gdr , compulsory military service was introduced in 1962 .
there are currently about 250,000 men in the german army .
of that amount , 68,270 are conscripts and of those , 25,270 are soldiers who volunteered to remain a few months longer after their mandatory service was up .
future possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association another concern of reducing military service is the concomitant effect on civil service positions that have been filled by men who chose not to serve in the military .
some have said this loss of manpower to civil organizations would be harmful .
but peter tobiassen , the head of an organization that represents conscientious objectors , has said that there are three times as many applicants for those positions than there are jobs available .
while the cdu and csu want to maintain some sort of military conscription in the future , the idea of an all-voluntary military continues to circulate .
in an interview in july , germany 's incoming foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said that while conscription had its merits , it was a thing of the past .
ulrich kirsch , the chairman of the federal armed forces association said that the german army was " open to " the idea of an all voluntary force , but more research was needed .
in any event , kirsch noted that changing to an all voluntary army would require amending the constitution , which would take a two-thirds majority , and that that was not going to happen in the near future. av / dpa / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the cdu and csu want to maintain some sort of military conscription in the future , the idea of an all-voluntary military continues to circulate .
in an interview in july , germany 's incoming foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said that while conscription had its merits , it was a thing of the past .
ulrich kirsch , the chairman of the federal armed forces association said that the german army was " open to " the idea of an all voluntary force , but more research was needed .
in any event , kirsch noted that changing to an all voluntary army would require amending the constitution , which would take a two-thirds majority , and that that was not going to happen in the near future. av / dpa / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 24.10.2009 jewish scholar challenged tradition with creation of unique library großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warburg examined the influence of the antiquity on later works a library established by hamburg-born jewish art historian aby m. warburg narrowly escaped destruction by the nazis to become one of the most significant book collections in europe to this day . he was " a jew by birth , a florentine in spirit , and a hamburger at heart . " that 's how art historian aby warburg saw himself in his own words . one of his most outstanding achievements was the founding of the warburg cultural studies library , which was officially opened in 1926 .
with four levels , the library was not exactly small , but it was designed in a space-saving manner .
narrow corridors and low doors awaited the visitors behind a red-brick facade .
the library 's infrastructure included the most modern technology of the time for transporting the books from one place to another , including special conveyor belts .
there were 26 telephone connections , a pneumatic tube , and an elevator for books and for staff .
a costly blank check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warburg was a great achiever , though plagued by mental instability warburg financed his library through his father 's banking firm , and later through that of his brother 's , who had moved to the united states .
" when aby was 13 years old , he offered me his firstborn rights , " said warburg 's brother , max .
" since he was the oldest , he was meant to go into the family business .
i was 12 at the time and agreed to buy his firstborn rights .
but he asked me to promise that i would always buy him all the books that he needed .
and , after short consideration , i agreed . "
in this way , warburg 's brother closed the deal - without realizing that this " exchange " involved writing out what was probably the most expensive blank check of his life .
behind the achievement of the library , there was a fragile human being .
with his poor health and bouts of depression , warburg from time to time underwent psychotherapy .
in 1918 , at the end of world war i , he suffered a mental breakdown - a culmination of his phobias , obsessions and delusions .
at the same time , however , he managed to gain widespread acclaim as an art historian , private scholar and researcher .
a non-traditional approach warburg was not interested in a purely aesthetic approach to art history .
his personal focus was the debate over the legacy of antiquity , which he approached with his portrayal of sandro botticelli 's works , the art of florentine painter , works by albrecht duerer and ancient pagan prophecies in written and visual representations .
" one day , i 'm sitting in the library 's lecture room with a newspaper from 1915 , " said rene drommert , a student librarian at the warburg house in the 1920s .
" suddenly , aby warburg appears and says , ' what are you doing there , mr drommert ? '
and i say : ' i 'm interested in the world war i era . '
warburg then bends over the desk and points to an advertisement offering flour and potatoes in exchange for a carpet .
and he says : ' naturally , you have the include things like this to get a good idea of the cultural and social life at the time . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for warburg , art was not just aesthetics , but the way people lived in warburg 's lifetime , the cultural studies library was considered to be an intellectual center in the weimar republic - and it remained that way till after his death on october 26 , 1929 .
many renowned scholars worked in the library 's reading room , including ernst cassirer , erwin panofsky and albert einstein .
according to charles hope , art historian and director of the warburg institute in london , what stands out is the prevalence of jewish scholars at the library .
" in my opinion , these people did not think that their jewishness had a large influence on their scholarliness , " said hope .
" their jewish background was of limited importance to them . "
second start in england this was until the rise of the nazi party threatened the library 's survival and forced it to move to london , which it did on december 12 , 1933 .
thanks to generous support on the british side , the library was preserved .
today , with 350,000 books , it is called the warburg institute and it is still one of the most significant humanities-oriented book collections in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cultural studies library is one of europe 's most important book collections the library gained its good reputation thanks to its unusual collection of books , as well as its interdisciplinary classification system , which links together very different subject areas : psychology and anthropology , theater , celebration and music , astrology and astronomy , chemistry and mathematics .
warburg himself had arranged the books in an interdisciplinary manner , and even the library 's architectural details reflected his educational motivations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 24.10.2009 germany 's new top diplomat untested in foreign affairs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle has little direct experience of foreign policy guido westerwelle is to become germany 's foreign minister when chancellor merkel 's new government takes office next week .
but with no ministerial or foreign affairs experience , what does he bring to the table ? guido westerwelle , 47 , led the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to their best-ever result in the september 27 election , with the party taking just under 15 percent of the vote .
that ended an 11-year spell in opposition for the fdp and paved the way for it to become the junior coalition partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
it has also handed westerwelle a chance to move on from his role as leader of the opposition and on to greener pastures .
the roles of foreign minister and vice-chancellor are traditionally awarded to the leader of the junior party in federal coalition governments .
westerwelle assumes these positions from social democrat frank-walter steinmeier , who was also the spd 's chancellor candidate in the recent election .
political freshman but with only experience outside of government , and a political career that has barely , if ever , involved foreign relations , some are asking what westerwelle can bring to the position .
he has little direct experience of foreign policy but has recently made some visits abroad , including to russia .
his party is pro-american and westerwelle is not expected to deviate from the approach of his predecessors , nor from the " basic tenets " of post-war german foreign policy .
on saturday , oct .
24 , westerwelle said nuclear non-proliferation and the removal of us atomic warheads from german soil would be a priority for his ministry .
merkel has said this would be achieved through dialog with germany 's partners in the nato forum .
westerwelle is also known to be a supporter of stronger trans-atlantic ties , and is a member of the non-partisan atlantik bruecke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization , dedicated to achieving this goal .
but that wo n't necessarily mean that germany will give in to us wishes to commit more troops to afghanistan .
while westerwelle has been vague on many foreign-policy points , he has stated clearly his aversion to any expansion in german army operations under nato .
questions over effectiveness but westerwelle is bound to make waves for being europe 's first openly gay foreign minister , having publicly " come out " at merkel 's 50th birthday party .
the trained lawyer has dismissed any notion that this could pose problems in his role as foreign minister .
" some other countries may have had a problem with the fact that angela merkel became the first female chancellor of germany .
of course she does not wear a veil on the red carpet when she visits certain arab states , " he has been quoted as saying .
" the decision as to whom we send as a government representative rests solely with us germans , based on our political and moral standards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle introduced his partner michael mronz , right , some five years ago born in bad honnef , near bonn in western germany , westerwelle was elected to the german parliament in 1996 and became head of the fdp in 2001 .
westerwelle 's seeming reluctance to speak english has raised some questions about his suitability for the post of germany 's top diplomat .
westerwelle declined to answer a question in english that had been put to him by a bbc reporter during his first news conference after last month 's elections . " in great britain it is expected that people speak english , and it is the same in germany - people are expected to speak german , " westerwelle said at the time , prompting heated debate on the internet .
on the domestic front , the thorniest issue for westerwelle has been over tax cuts .
the free democrats had promised voters 35 billion euros worth of cuts in the recent election , but merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wanted only 15 billion euros .
on saturday , the coalition partners put this issue to bed , agreeing on 24 billion euros in cuts. dfm / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german parties reach coalition deal chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives are set to form a coalition government after sealing a deal with the free democrats .
the agreement came after the parties struck a compromise on thorny financial issues .
-lrb- 24.10.2009 -rrb- new german government to shorten military conscription germany 's new coalition government plans to reduce the time that young men must serve in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr .
the reaction from all sides has been swift and not all of it is positive .
-lrb- 24.10.2009 -rrb- experts support westerwelle 's quest to rid germany of us nuclear arms the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .
could this signal a shake-up in german foreign policy ? -lrb- 04.10.2009 -rrb- feedback is it worrisome that westerwelle has been so vague on the foreign policy front ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 24.10.2009 germany 's new top diplomat untested in foreign affairs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle has little direct experience of foreign policy guido westerwelle is to become germany 's foreign minister when chancellor merkel 's new government takes office next week .
but with no ministerial or foreign affairs experience , what does he bring to the table ? guido westerwelle , 47 , led the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to their best-ever result in the september 27 election , with the party taking just under 15 percent of the vote .
that ended an 11-year spell in opposition for the fdp and paved the way for it to become the junior coalition partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
it has also handed westerwelle a chance to move on from his role as leader of the opposition and on to greener pastures .
the roles of foreign minister and vice-chancellor are traditionally awarded to the leader of the junior party in federal coalition governments .
westerwelle assumes these positions from social democrat frank-walter steinmeier , who was also the spd 's chancellor candidate in the recent election .
political freshman but with only experience outside of government , and a political career that has barely , if ever , involved foreign relations , some are asking what westerwelle can bring to the position .
he has little direct experience of foreign policy but has recently made some visits abroad , including to russia .
his party is pro-american and westerwelle is not expected to deviate from the approach of his predecessors , nor from the " basic tenets " of post-war german foreign policy .
on saturday , oct .
24 , westerwelle said nuclear non-proliferation and the removal of us atomic warheads from german soil would be a priority for his ministry .
merkel has said this would be achieved through dialog with germany 's partners in the nato forum .
westerwelle is also known to be a supporter of stronger trans-atlantic ties , and is a member of the non-partisan atlantik bruecke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization , dedicated to achieving this goal .
but that wo n't necessarily mean that germany will give in to us wishes to commit more troops to afghanistan .
while westerwelle has been vague on many foreign-policy points , he has stated clearly his aversion to any expansion in german army operations under nato .
questions over effectiveness but westerwelle is bound to make waves for being europe 's first openly gay foreign minister , having publicly " come out " at merkel 's 50th birthday party .
the trained lawyer has dismissed any notion that this could pose problems in his role as foreign minister .
" some other countries may have had a problem with the fact that angela merkel became the first female chancellor of germany .
of course she does not wear a veil on the red carpet when she visits certain arab states , " he has been quoted as saying .
" the decision as to whom we send as a government representative rests solely with us germans , based on our political and moral standards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle introduced his partner michael mronz , right , some five years ago born in bad honnef , near bonn in western germany , westerwelle was elected to the german parliament in 1996 and became head of the fdp in 2001 .
westerwelle 's seeming reluctance to speak english has raised some questions about his suitability for the post of germany 's top diplomat .
westerwelle declined to answer a question in english that had been put to him by a bbc reporter during his first news conference after last month 's elections . " in great britain it is expected that people speak english , and it is the same in germany - people are expected to speak german , " westerwelle said at the time , prompting heated debate on the internet .
on the domestic front , the thorniest issue for westerwelle has been over tax cuts .
the free democrats had promised voters 35 billion euros worth of cuts in the recent election , but merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wanted only 15 billion euros .
on saturday , the coalition partners put this issue to bed , agreeing on 24 billion euros in cuts. dfm / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 24.10.2009 czech nod raises new hope for eu treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorny obstacles have delayed the treaty and the creation of a new european commission the european union 's lisbon treaty looks set to emerge from a limbo as the last hurdle to its ratification , czech president vaclav klaus , accepted a concession offered by the 27-nation bloc . vaclav klaus is the last eu leader holding out on signing the treaty , which aims to streamline eu decision-making and must be ratified by all members to take effect .
on friday , the staunch eurosceptic accepted a proposal by the swedish eu presidency to handle an opt-out from the treaty which he demands .
" this proposal corresponds to the president 's expectations and he can continue to work with it , " said klaus 's office .
critics of the czech president regard the demand as another attempt to delay the ratification .
however , friday 's statement by klaus 's office is the second glimmer of hope for the eu in a week , after the president suggested just days ago that he would ultimately sign .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , no matter how much some of us would want that , " he said last saturday , fueling hopes that the treaty might take effect soon .
exemption clause on property two weeks ago , klaus asked for an exemption from the treaty that would prevent ethnic germans forced out of his country after world war ii from reclaiming their property .
britain and poland won similar exemptions during the treaty negotiations in 2007 – catholic poland was assured it would not be forced to allow gay marriages , and britain promised that eu laws and courts would not prevail over its own judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso is unable to set up a new commission due to delays to the lisbon treaty stefan fule , czech minister for eu affairs , said the czech exemption would be a general one , comprising a comma and the words " czech republic " attached to " great britain " and " poland " in the treaty 's protocol .
recognizing that the chances that klaus might yield were slim , sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the czech cabinet set out to work on the wording of the exemption , which they hope to submit to the eu for approval at a summit next week .
european commission held up the eu has been waiting in suspense for klaus ' signature , the last step in the czech ratification process after local lawmakers approved the treaty earlier this year .
the impasse means that european commission chief jose manuel barroso , who was last month granted a second five-year term , is unable to nominate a new commission , because it is unclear what legal basis he should use .
the mandate of the current commission – the eu 's executive arm – expires at the end of october .
the body that draws up legislation impacting the lives of about half a billion europeans and policing the application of eu laws is likely to remain a lame duck until the future becomes clearer .
this may take some time as klaus has also linked his signature to a go-ahead from the top czech court , which is currently assessing the treaty 's compliance with the country 's constitution following a complaint filed by a group of eurosceptic senators .
like president klaus , the senators fear the treaty will give too much power to brussels and threaten czech sovereignty .
the court has said it will discuss the complaint in a public hearing on tuesday , but it is unclear how long the process might take .
concerns over further hurdles the president of the european parliament , jerzy buzek , said on friday he expected the lisbon reform treaty to come into force before the end of the year while admitting that challenges persisted .
" it 's my personal opinion : i can say that it 's a very high probability that we will have our lisbon treaty in place at the end of this year , " he said in an interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus recently conceded that the lisbon treaty is inevitable however , buzek voiced concerns an opt-out deal with the czechs could " bring problems in other member states " .
" we would like to have a solution proper for the czech republic and for president klaus to sign the lisbon treaty .
but of course we would n't like to have problems in other member states , " he said .
concerns that more countries may try to negotiate footnotes to the charter intensified last week after slovak prime minister robert fico said he may ask for an opt-out clause for his country if the czechs succeed. rb / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on friday , the staunch eurosceptic accepted a proposal by the swedish eu presidency to handle an opt-out from the treaty which he demands .
" this proposal corresponds to the president 's expectations and he can continue to work with it , " said klaus 's office .
critics of the czech president regard the demand as another attempt to delay the ratification .
however , friday 's statement by klaus 's office is the second glimmer of hope for the eu in a week , after the president suggested just days ago that he would ultimately sign .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , no matter how much some of us would want that , " he said last saturday , fueling hopes that the treaty might take effect soon .
exemption clause on property two weeks ago , klaus asked for an exemption from the treaty that would prevent ethnic germans forced out of his country after world war ii from reclaiming their property .
britain and poland won similar exemptions during the treaty negotiations in 2007 – catholic poland was assured it would not be forced to allow gay marriages , and britain promised that eu laws and courts would not prevail over its own judicial system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso is unable to set up a new commission due to delays to the lisbon treaty stefan fule , czech minister for eu affairs , said the czech exemption would be a general one , comprising a comma and the words " czech republic " attached to " great britain " and " poland " in the treaty 's protocol .
recognizing that the chances that klaus might yield were slim , sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the czech cabinet set out to work on the wording of the exemption , which they hope to submit to the eu for approval at a summit next week .
european commission held up the eu has been waiting in suspense for klaus ' signature , the last step in the czech ratification process after local lawmakers approved the treaty earlier this year .
the impasse means that european commission chief jose manuel barroso , who was last month granted a second five-year term , is unable to nominate a new commission , because it is unclear what legal basis he should use .
the mandate of the current commission – the eu 's executive arm – expires at the end of october .
the body that draws up legislation impacting the lives of about half a billion europeans and policing the application of eu laws is likely to remain a lame duck until the future becomes clearer .
this may take some time as klaus has also linked his signature to a go-ahead from the top czech court , which is currently assessing the treaty 's compliance with the country 's constitution following a complaint filed by a group of eurosceptic senators .
like president klaus , the senators fear the treaty will give too much power to brussels and threaten czech sovereignty .
the court has said it will discuss the complaint in a public hearing on tuesday , but it is unclear how long the process might take .
concerns over further hurdles the president of the european parliament , jerzy buzek , said on friday he expected the lisbon reform treaty to come into force before the end of the year while admitting that challenges persisted .
" it 's my personal opinion : i can say that it 's a very high probability that we will have our lisbon treaty in place at the end of this year , " he said in an interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus recently conceded that the lisbon treaty is inevitable however , buzek voiced concerns an opt-out deal with the czechs could " bring problems in other member states " .
" we would like to have a solution proper for the czech republic and for president klaus to sign the lisbon treaty .
but of course we would n't like to have problems in other member states , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 24.10.2009 germany 's new top diplomat untested in foreign affairs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle has little direct experience of foreign policy guido westerwelle is to become germany 's foreign minister when chancellor merkel 's new government takes office next week .
but with no ministerial or foreign affairs experience , what does he bring to the table ? guido westerwelle , 47 , led the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to their best-ever result in the september 27 election , with the party taking just under 15 percent of the vote .
that ended an 11-year spell in opposition for the fdp and paved the way for it to become the junior coalition partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
it has also handed westerwelle a chance to move on from his role as leader of the opposition and on to greener pastures .
the roles of foreign minister and vice-chancellor are traditionally awarded to the leader of the junior party in federal coalition governments .
westerwelle assumes these positions from social democrat frank-walter steinmeier , who was also the spd 's chancellor candidate in the recent election .
political freshman but with only experience outside of government , and a political career that has barely , if ever , involved foreign relations , some are asking what westerwelle can bring to the position .
he has little direct experience of foreign policy but has recently made some visits abroad , including to russia .
his party is pro-american and westerwelle is not expected to deviate from the approach of his predecessors , nor from the " basic tenets " of post-war german foreign policy .
on saturday , oct .
24 , westerwelle said nuclear non-proliferation and the removal of us atomic warheads from german soil would be a priority for his ministry .
merkel has said this would be achieved through dialog with germany 's partners in the nato forum .
westerwelle is also known to be a supporter of stronger trans-atlantic ties , and is a member of the non-partisan atlantik bruecke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization , dedicated to achieving this goal .
but that wo n't necessarily mean that germany will give in to us wishes to commit more troops to afghanistan .
while westerwelle has been vague on many foreign-policy points , he has stated clearly his aversion to any expansion in german army operations under nato .
questions over effectiveness but westerwelle is bound to make waves for being europe 's first openly gay foreign minister , having publicly " come out " at merkel 's 50th birthday party .
the trained lawyer has dismissed any notion that this could pose problems in his role as foreign minister .
" some other countries may have had a problem with the fact that angela merkel became the first female chancellor of germany .
of course she does not wear a veil on the red carpet when she visits certain arab states , " he has been quoted as saying .
" the decision as to whom we send as a government representative rests solely with us germans , based on our political and moral standards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle introduced his partner michael mronz , right , some five years ago born in bad honnef , near bonn in western germany , westerwelle was elected to the german parliament in 1996 and became head of the fdp in 2001 .
westerwelle 's seeming reluctance to speak english has raised some questions about his suitability for the post of germany 's top diplomat .
westerwelle declined to answer a question in english that had been put to him by a bbc reporter during his first news conference after last month 's elections . " in great britain it is expected that people speak english , and it is the same in germany - people are expected to speak german , " westerwelle said at the time , prompting heated debate on the internet .
on the domestic front , the thorniest issue for westerwelle has been over tax cuts .
the free democrats had promised voters 35 billion euros worth of cuts in the recent election , but merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wanted only 15 billion euros .
on saturday , the coalition partners put this issue to bed , agreeing on 24 billion euros in cuts. dfm / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 24.10.2009 german parties reach coalition deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal came after marathon talks that stretched into the wee hours of saturday chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives are set to form a coalition government after sealing a deal with the free democrats .
the agreement came after the parties struck a compromise on thorny financial issues . the late-night agreement paves the way for a new center-right government to take office next week , nearly a month after merkel 's conservatives and the free democrats won a parliamentary majority in the september 27 federal election .
just hours after reaching consensus , the coalition partners announced plans to cut taxes from january 1 next year . " the burden on families has to be lessened , the burden on companies and inheritance tax has to be reformed , " chancellor merkel said during a press conference in berlin on saturday . " we are aiming for growth , " she said , adding that the new government would focus on education and social cohesion .
" we have agreed a coalition program showing that we want to advance courageously into the future . " at the joint news conference with merkel , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , described the coalition agreement as " a great compass for our country . " sharing key cabinet posts the parties divided up key cabinet posts , with current interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the cdu being chosen to head the finance ministry , while the fdp 's westerwelle is to become foreign minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has earned a reputation as a hardliner when it comes to security policy the 67-year-old schaeuble , who has been bound to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 and has the reputation of being a hardliner on domestic security policy , was a surprise choice for the post of finance minister .
ahead of the september election , he indirectly criticized merkel 's pledge to pursue billions of euros in tax cuts , saying there was little room for them given germany 's strained finances .
now schaeuble will be charged with implementing those cuts against the backdrop of a deficit that is poised to rise to double european union limits next year .
news of his likely appointment sparked mixed reactions in germany on friday .
“ he 's an unknown entity when it comes to financial issues , " dennis snower , head of the kiel-based institute for economic research , told the reuters news agency .
" you ca n't make any predictions about his future financial policy based on what he 's done so far . "
" i think he 's a tough cookie and this is what will be needed , " carsten brzeski , senior economist at ing financial markets said .
" he is someone who would not be afraid of ruining his public image due to unpopular decision-making . "
thomas de maiziere , merkel 's trusted lieutenant as chief of staff , is set to take over schaeble 's job at the interior ministry .
free democrats bag prominent posts as widely expected , the post of foreign minister goes to fdp leader guido westerwelle .

the reaction from all sides has been swift and not all of it is positive . a deal to reduce the period of compulsory military service in germany was worked out between chancellor angela merkel 's incoming government coalition of the conservative union parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
as of january 1 , 2011 , military service will be reduced from nine months to six .
in its election platform , the fdp had called for an abolishment of conscription , however chancellor merkel prefers to keep some form of military service .
as it now stands , young men are obliged to do a compulsory tour of duty in the german military .
they can opt out or refuse , but then must perform " civilian service , " such as working in a hospital , nursing home or other civil organization .
under the new proposal , military service will consist of three months of basic training , two months of specialized training and one month of duty in specialist service units .
the reactions to the deal have been swift and varied .
while werner hoyer , a member of the fdp , called it a reasonable compromise , johannes kahrs , a leader in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the proposal pure nonsense .
" for military service to have any value at all , it should take at least nine months , " said kahrs in an interview with the hamburg abendblatt newspaper .
spd defense expert rainer arnold said that lowering the time from nine months to six relegated military service to " an introductory course " instead of a full meal .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mutual distrust kept conscription alive one of the main reasons for conscription and maintaining an army in readiness in the past was the deep mistrust that existed between the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- and west germany .
service in the military for all men over the age of 18 became compulsory in 1956 .
the option of doing civil service instead of military service was introduced in 1961 .
over the years , the amount of time one had to serve in the military has been reduced .
in the 1960s it was 18 months .
after january 2002 that number had fallen to nine months .
in the former gdr , compulsory military service was introduced in 1962 .
there are currently about 250,000 men in the german army .
of that amount , 68,270 are conscripts and of those , 25,270 are soldiers who volunteered to remain a few months longer after their mandatory service was up .
future possibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association another concern of reducing military service is the concomitant effect on civil service positions that have been filled by men who chose not to serve in the military .
some have said this loss of manpower to civil organizations would be harmful .
but peter tobiassen , the head of an organization that represents conscientious objectors , has said that there are three times as many applicants for those positions than there are jobs available .
while the cdu and csu want to maintain some sort of military conscription in the future , the idea of an all-voluntary military continues to circulate .
in an interview in july , germany 's incoming foreign minister , guido westerwelle , said that while conscription had its merits , it was a thing of the past .
ulrich kirsch , the chairman of the federal armed forces association said that the german army was " open to " the idea of an all voluntary force , but more research was needed .
in any event , kirsch noted that changing to an all voluntary army would require amending the constitution , which would take a two-thirds majority , and that that was not going to happen in the near future. av / dpa / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ i suggest that we lock in the determination to act already by copenhagen and seek political commitment for immediate implementation , ” lars lokke rasmussen said on saturday .
he added that it was possible to outline the main components of an agreement to replace that which was forged in kyoto in 1997 , and to implement it early next year .
" in this way , copenhagen could provide for immediate action based on a comprehensive set of binding political commitments from world leaders , " rasmussen said .
the current european development days meetings in stockholm are aimed at forming european union policy ahead of the copenhagen talks december 7-18 . environment and climate ministers are set to meet in barcelona next week , and another ministerial summit in copenhagen is scheduled for mid-november .

but there is no agreement on some of the most important questions , including the commitment of industrialized and developing nations to abide by goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , and the quantity of aid to be given to poor nations to reduce emissions .
" the right funding package " oxfam international executive director jeremy hobbs was less than optimistic about the chances for new climate standards if rich countries refuse to help bear the developing countries ' costs for meeting them .
“ we do n't think there will be a deal without the right funding package , ” hobbs told afp .

the priests , from catholic-minded anglican group forward in faith , are unhappy about the way women bishops are being introduced into the coe .
they will decide how to respond to pope benedict 's invitation which could allow them to retain some anglican practices .
critics say it may harm the coe 's role in uniting catholics and protestants .
clergy on the " high church " wing of anglicanism , known for their use of more elaborate ritual in services , are alarmed that the church of england 's historic role in uniting catholic and protestant in the same church may now be in jeopardy .
' inexcusable ' father geoffrey kirk , one of the leaders of forward in faith , said : " it will be my intention whatever happens to become a roman catholic .
" i am close to retirement , and i may well choose to defer my retirement in order to see that my parish transfers itself to the roman jurisdiction , as well as myself . "
" i think in this day and age this was inexcusable that rome decided to do this without consultation " lord carey rome fishes in anglican pond as the dispute in the coe about women bishops has intensified , many " anglo-catholics " have warned they will transfer to the roman catholic church unless they are given guaranteed access to male alternatives .
in the spectacular setting of st james ' roman catholic church in london 's spanish place , father christopher colven celebrates mass .
only 13 years ago he was an anglican priest and says he was brought up to see the coe as part of a wider " universal " catholic church .
serving in a church that had preserved its catholic traditions for more than five centuries was central to his faith .
clerical celibacy but after the coe ordained woman priests , he felt those traditions had finally been abandoned and says converting to catholicism was liberating .
" for me there has always been a tremendous sense of relief .
living as an anglican - honestly trying to live as a catholic priest within anglicanism - involved for me all kinds of compromises , " he said .
" becoming a catholic .. .it 's a very freeing experience . "
a few miles across london at st stephen 's and all hallows in hampstead , mass is celebrated with exactly the same ritual , ceremony and attention to detail .
st stephen 's is anglican , but although mass here on the catholic wing of the coe is virtually identical to that at st james ' , its priest , father david houlding , has a different goal .
he is desperate to preserve the historic character of the coe inherited from the days of elizabeth i 500 years ago , as both catholic and protestant .
fr houlding fears the pope 's invitation could draw away people like him , before a settlement over women bishops is reached and leave behind a more protestant church .
he said : " that is my concern of course .
i do n't want to see that happening .
i fear it might .
it 's not my agenda but it could happen .
" -lsb- the catholic tradition -rsb- is important to the identity of the coe .
that 's what we are fighting for ... we are fighting for the identity of the coe " .
evangelical anglicans have also criticised the vatican 's initiative , some even accusing it of capitalising on anglican disputes to try to poach the church 's clergy .
others have questioned the way anglican leaders were informed about it little more than two weeks ago .
in saturday 's times , former archbishop of canterbury lord carey says he is appalled that his successor rowan williams may have had only a fortnight 's notice .
" i think , in this day and age , this was inexcusable that rome decided to do this without consultation , " he says .
stephen trott , a member of the catholic group on the church of england 's ruling body , the synod , told the bbc the announcement had been mistimed , coming just as negotiations over women bishops reached a critical stage and the church sensed compromise .
" i think it 's come as a surprise and even a shock to those most closely involved in the discussions because these have been proceeding and making progress , " he said .
" this announcement seems rather untimely given our discussions . "
the vatican said it was simply responding to approaches by anglicans in search of a spiritual home .
however , the roman catholic church might not be quite the haven they expect .
coe clergy would probably lose their houses and church buildings , and it is unlikely many would take their entire congregations with them .
' anglican identity ' mr trott said former anglicans were likely to be able to use a revised edition of the anglican prayer book , with services such as evensong and matins .
but he said it was doubtful how far they could preserve a genuinely " anglican identity " in the catholic church .
" i think that when people look at the offer , it is n't really very different from what is already available to someone wanting to become a catholic , " he said .
" already the terms of the offer as published on the vatican website indicate ... that it would really be limited to some parts of the forms of worship that the coe uses - the book of common prayer - and i do n't know whether that would be enough to persuade many people to leave the coe . "
there could be implications for the roman catholic church too .
an influx of highly-educated , relatively conservative priests with a tradition of warm and lively relations with parishioners could create an enclave able to compete powerfully with existing catholic parishes .
fr kirk says married newcomers might also make catholics question whether their priests need to be celibate .
" many married clergy coming in from the anglican church to the roman church with their wives will raise yet again the issue of clerical celibacy in the roman church , " he said .
some are wondering whether the arrival of new catholic-anglicans could yet turn out to be a trojan horse , bringing as much change to the roman catholic church in england and wales , as their departure causes to the coe .

the priests , from catholic-minded anglican group forward in faith , are unhappy about the way women bishops are being introduced into the coe .
they will decide how to respond to pope benedict 's invitation which could allow them to retain some anglican practices .
critics say it may harm the coe 's role in uniting catholics and protestants .
clergy on the " high church " wing of anglicanism , known for their use of more elaborate ritual in services , are alarmed that the church of england 's historic role in uniting catholic and protestant in the same church may now be in jeopardy .
' inexcusable ' father geoffrey kirk , one of the leaders of forward in faith , said : " it will be my intention whatever happens to become a roman catholic .
" i am close to retirement , and i may well choose to defer my retirement in order to see that my parish transfers itself to the roman jurisdiction , as well as myself . "

in the spectacular setting of st james ' roman catholic church in london 's spanish place , father christopher colven celebrates mass .
only 13 years ago he was an anglican priest and says he was brought up to see the coe as part of a wider " universal " catholic church .
serving in a church that had preserved its catholic traditions for more than five centuries was central to his faith .
clerical celibacy but after the coe ordained woman priests , he felt those traditions had finally been abandoned and says converting to catholicism was liberating .
" for me there has always been a tremendous sense of relief .
living as an anglican - honestly trying to live as a catholic priest within anglicanism - involved for me all kinds of compromises , " he said .
" becoming a catholic .. .it 's a very freeing experience . "
a few miles across london at st stephen 's and all hallows in hampstead , mass is celebrated with exactly the same ritual , ceremony and attention to detail .
st stephen 's is anglican , but although mass here on the catholic wing of the coe is virtually identical to that at st james ' , its priest , father david houlding , has a different goal .
he is desperate to preserve the historic character of the coe inherited from the days of elizabeth i 500 years ago , as both catholic and protestant .
fr houlding fears the pope 's invitation could draw away people like him , before a settlement over women bishops is reached and leave behind a more protestant church .
he said : " that is my concern of course .
i do n't want to see that happening .
i fear it might .
it 's not my agenda but it could happen .
" -lsb- the catholic tradition -rsb- is important to the identity of the coe .
that 's what we are fighting for ... we are fighting for the identity of the coe " .
evangelical anglicans have also criticised the vatican 's initiative , some even accusing it of capitalising on anglican disputes to try to poach the church 's clergy .
others have questioned the way anglican leaders were informed about it little more than two weeks ago .
rowan williams was reportedly only told of the initiative two weeks ago in saturday 's times , former archbishop of canterbury lord carey says he is appalled that his successor rowan williams may have had only a fortnight 's notice .
" i think , in this day and age , this was inexcusable that rome decided to do this without consultation , " he says .
stephen trott , a member of the catholic group on the church of england 's ruling body , the synod , told the bbc the announcement had been mistimed , coming just as negotiations over women bishops reached a critical stage and the church sensed compromise .
" i think it 's come as a surprise and even a shock to those most closely involved in the discussions because these have been proceeding and making progress , " he said .
" this announcement seems rather untimely given our discussions . "
the vatican said it was simply responding to approaches by anglicans in search of a spiritual home .
however , the roman catholic church might not be quite the haven they expect .
coe clergy would probably lose their houses and church buildings , and it is unlikely many would take their entire congregations with them .
' anglican identity ' mr trott said former anglicans were likely to be able to use a revised edition of the anglican prayer book , with services such as evensong and matins .
but he said it was doubtful how far they could preserve a genuinely " anglican identity " in the catholic church .
" i think that when people look at the offer , it is n't really very different from what is already available to someone wanting to become a catholic , " he said .
" already the terms of the offer as published on the vatican website indicate ... that it would really be limited to some parts of the forms of worship that the coe uses - the book of common prayer - and i do n't know whether that would be enough to persuade many people to leave the coe . "
there could be implications for the roman catholic church too .
an influx of highly-educated , relatively conservative priests with a tradition of warm and lively relations with parishioners could create an enclave able to compete powerfully with existing catholic parishes .
fr kirk says married newcomers might also make catholics question whether their priests need to be celibate .
" many married clergy coming in from the anglican church to the roman church with their wives will raise yet again the issue of clerical celibacy in the roman church , " he said .
some are wondering whether the arrival of new catholic-anglicans could yet turn out to be a trojan horse , bringing as much change to the roman catholic church in england and wales , as their departure causes to the coe .

the priests , from catholic-minded anglican group forward in faith , are unhappy about the way women bishops are being introduced into the coe .
they will decide how to respond to pope benedict 's invitation which could allow them to retain some anglican practices .
critics say it may harm the coe 's role in uniting catholics and protestants .
clergy on the " high church " wing of anglicanism , known for their use of more elaborate ritual in services , are alarmed that the church of england 's historic role in uniting catholic and protestant in the same church may now be in jeopardy .
' inexcusable ' father geoffrey kirk , one of the leaders of forward in faith , said : " it will be my intention whatever happens to become a roman catholic .
" i am close to retirement , and i may well choose to defer my retirement in order to see that my parish transfers itself to the roman jurisdiction , as well as myself . "
i think in this day and age this was inexcusable that rome decided to do this without consultation lord carey rome fishes in anglican pond as the dispute in the coe about women bishops has intensified , many " anglo-catholics " have warned they will transfer to the roman catholic church unless they are given guaranteed access to male alternatives .
in the spectacular setting of st james ' roman catholic church in london 's spanish place , father christopher colven celebrates mass .
only 13 years ago he was an anglican priest and says he was brought up to see the coe as part of a wider " universal " catholic church .
serving in a church that had preserved its catholic traditions for more than five centuries was central to his faith .
clerical celibacy but after the coe ordained woman priests , he felt those traditions had finally been abandoned and says converting to catholicism was liberating .
" for me there has always been a tremendous sense of relief .
living as an anglican - honestly trying to live as a catholic priest within anglicanism - involved for me all kinds of compromises , " he said .
" becoming a catholic .. .it 's a very freeing experience . "
a few miles across london at st stephen 's and all hallows in hampstead , mass is celebrated with exactly the same ritual , ceremony and attention to detail .
st stephen 's is anglican , but although mass here on the catholic wing of the coe is virtually identical to that at st james ' , its priest , father david houlding , has a different goal .
he is desperate to preserve the historic character of the coe inherited from the days of elizabeth i 500 years ago , as both catholic and protestant .
fr houlding fears the pope 's invitation could draw away people like him , before a settlement over women bishops is reached and leave behind a more protestant church .
he said : " that is my concern of course .
i do n't want to see that happening .
i fear it might .
it 's not my agenda but it could happen .
" -lsb- the catholic tradition -rsb- is important to the identity of the coe .
that 's what we are fighting for ... we are fighting for the identity of the coe " .
evangelical anglicans have also criticised the vatican 's initiative , some even accusing it of capitalising on anglican disputes to try to poach the church 's clergy .
others have questioned the way anglican leaders were informed about it little more than two weeks ago .
rowan williams was reportedly only told of the initiative two weeks ago in saturday 's times , former archbishop of canterbury lord carey says he is appalled that his successor rowan williams may have had only a fortnight 's notice .
" i think , in this day and age , this was inexcusable that rome decided to do this without consultation , " he says .
stephen trott , a member of the catholic group on the church of england 's ruling body , the synod , told the bbc the announcement had been mistimed , coming just as negotiations over women bishops reached a critical stage and the church sensed compromise .
" i think it 's come as a surprise and even a shock to those most closely involved in the discussions because these have been proceeding and making progress , " he said .
" this announcement seems rather untimely given our discussions . "
the vatican said it was simply responding to approaches by anglicans in search of a spiritual home .
however , the roman catholic church might not be quite the haven they expect .
coe clergy would probably lose their houses and church buildings , and it is unlikely many would take their entire congregations with them .
' anglican identity ' mr trott said former anglicans were likely to be able to use a revised edition of the anglican prayer book , with services such as evensong and matins .
but he said it was doubtful how far they could preserve a genuinely " anglican identity " in the catholic church .
" i think that when people look at the offer , it is n't really very different from what is already available to someone wanting to become a catholic , " he said .
" already the terms of the offer as published on the vatican website indicate ... that it would really be limited to some parts of the forms of worship that the coe uses - the book of common prayer - and i do n't know whether that would be enough to persuade many people to leave the coe . "
there could be implications for the roman catholic church too .
an influx of highly-educated , relatively conservative priests with a tradition of warm and lively relations with parishioners could create an enclave able to compete powerfully with existing catholic parishes .
fr kirk says married newcomers might also make catholics question whether their priests need to be celibate .
" many married clergy coming in from the anglican church to the roman church with their wives will raise yet again the issue of clerical celibacy in the roman church , " he said .
some are wondering whether the arrival of new catholic-anglicans could yet turn out to be a trojan horse , bringing as much change to the roman catholic church in england and wales , as their departure causes to the coe .

" already the terms of the offer as published on the vatican website indicate ... that it would really be limited to some parts of the forms of worship that the coe uses - the book of common prayer - and i do n't know whether that would be enough to persuade many people to leave the coe . "
there could be implications for the roman catholic church too .
an influx of highly-educated , relatively conservative priests with a tradition of warm and lively relations with parishioners could create an enclave able to compete powerfully with existing catholic parishes .

the priests , from catholic-minded anglican group forward in faith , are unhappy about the way women bishops are being introduced into the coe .
they will decide how to respond to pope benedict 's invitation which could allow them to retain some anglican practices .
critics say it may harm the coe 's role in uniting catholics and protestants .
clergy on the " high church " wing of anglicanism , known for their use of more elaborate ritual in services , are alarmed that the church of england 's historic role in uniting catholic and protestant in the same church may now be in jeopardy .
' inexcusable ' father geoffrey kirk , one of the leaders of forward in faith , said : " it will be my intention whatever happens to become a roman catholic .
" i am close to retirement , and i may well choose to defer my retirement in order to see that my parish transfers itself to the roman jurisdiction , as well as myself . "
i think in this day and age this was inexcusable that rome decided to do this without consultation lord carey rome fishes in anglican pond as the dispute in the coe about women bishops has intensified , many " anglo-catholics " have warned they will transfer to the roman catholic church unless they are given guaranteed access to male alternatives .
in the spectacular setting of st james ' roman catholic church in london 's spanish place , father christopher colven celebrates mass .
only 13 years ago he was an anglican priest and says he was brought up to see the coe as part of a wider " universal " catholic church .
serving in a church that had preserved its catholic traditions for more than five centuries was central to his faith .
clerical celibacy but after the coe ordained woman priests , he felt those traditions had finally been abandoned and says converting to catholicism was liberating .
" for me there has always been a tremendous sense of relief .
living as an anglican - honestly trying to live as a catholic priest within anglicanism - involved for me all kinds of compromises , " he said .
" becoming a catholic .. .it 's a very freeing experience . "
a few miles across london at st stephen 's and all hallows in hampstead , mass is celebrated with exactly the same ritual , ceremony and attention to detail .
st stephen 's is anglican , but although mass here on the catholic wing of the coe is virtually identical to that at st james ' , its priest , father david houlding , has a different goal .
he is desperate to preserve the historic character of the coe inherited from the days of elizabeth i 500 years ago , as both catholic and protestant .
fr houlding fears the pope 's invitation could draw away people like him , before a settlement over women bishops is reached and leave behind a more protestant church .
he said : " that is my concern of course .
i do n't want to see that happening .
i fear it might .
it 's not my agenda but it could happen .
" -lsb- the catholic tradition -rsb- is important to the identity of the coe .
that 's what we are fighting for ... we are fighting for the identity of the coe " .
evangelical anglicans have also criticised the vatican 's initiative , some even accusing it of capitalising on anglican disputes to try to poach the church 's clergy .
others have questioned the way anglican leaders were informed about it little more than two weeks ago .
rowan williams was reportedly only told of the initiative two weeks ago in saturday 's times , former archbishop of canterbury lord carey says he is appalled that his successor rowan williams may have had only a fortnight 's notice .
" i think , in this day and age , this was inexcusable that rome decided to do this without consultation , " he says .
stephen trott , a member of the catholic group on the church of england 's ruling body , the synod , told the bbc the announcement had been mistimed , coming just as negotiations over women bishops reached a critical stage and the church sensed compromise .
" i think it 's come as a surprise and even a shock to those most closely involved in the discussions because these have been proceeding and making progress , " he said .
" this announcement seems rather untimely given our discussions . "
the vatican said it was simply responding to approaches by anglicans in search of a spiritual home .
however , the roman catholic church might not be quite the haven they expect .
coe clergy would probably lose their houses and church buildings , and it is unlikely many would take their entire congregations with them .
' anglican identity ' mr trott said former anglicans were likely to be able to use a revised edition of the anglican prayer book , with services such as evensong and matins .
but he said it was doubtful how far they could preserve a genuinely " anglican identity " in the catholic church .
