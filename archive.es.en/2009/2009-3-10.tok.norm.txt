as a major oil transit route , somalia 's coast is prone to pirate attacks . germany turned over nine pirates , arrested for attacking a merchant vessel in the gulf of aden off the somali coast last week , to kenya on tuesday , march 10 . the german navy frigate rheinland pfalz had seized the alleged pirates when they used bazookas and firearms to attack a german-owned merchant vessel .
since there were no german crew members and the vessel was sailing under an antiguan flag , prosecutors in berlin stated that national interests were not sufficiently at stake to try the captives in germany . although most pirates operating in the gulf of aden are from somalia , a former italian colony located in the horn of africa , the nation lacks a functioning legal system to stage a proper trial . handover possible after eu-kenyan deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since last year 24 pirates in all were handed over to kenya but kenya , which borders somalia to the southwest , has a justice system that meets the requirements set by germany , although human rights advocates have been critical of prison conditions there . human rights watch has said that inmates could be held in detention for months without any charges being pressed and are often denied legal counsel . tuesday 's handover was only possible after an agreement between the european union and kenya had paved the way for somali nationals to be prosecuted in kenya . the eu had specified in a deal last week that the captives can not be subjected to torture or the death sentence .
they would have the right to appear before a judge in a short period of time , would be entitled to legal representation and would be provided with an interpreter if needed . gulf of aden vulnerable to attack kenya 's marine police commander stanley lenamai told the associated press that the suspected pirates , who had arrived in the port city mombasa on tuesday , will be taken to court as soon as interpreters for them are found . the nine suspects bring the total number of people delivered to kenyan courts by foreign navies to 24 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirates demanded $ 25 million for super-tanker sirius star and crew more than 100 ships were attacked last year by pirates off the coast of somalia .
the gulf of aden is a vital transit route leading to the suez canal , where roughly 30 percent of the world 's oil is transported . nato , the eu and other countries , including russia and china , have deployed warships to fight piracy and protect the lucrative multi-billion dollar shipping lanes from the heavily armed pirates who use high-powered speedboats to launch their attacks and kidnap crew members . the german frigate that apprehended the nine men is part of the eu 's anti-piracy mission atalanta . df / sms / dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 're not planning on any additional measures , " steinbrueck told journalists as he arrived for a meeting with his eurozone counterparts in brussels on monday , march 9 .
" we should concentrate on measures that have already been decided . "
german lawmakers this year passed an stimulus package worth 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 63 billion -rrb- to haul europe 's largest economy out of its worst recession in decades .
it includes investments in infrastructure , tax relief , reductions in health care contributions and money for families with children .
it also provides 2,500-euro bonuses to people who junk old cars to buy new vehicles .
the package follows an earlier 23 billion-euro plan , criticized in germany and abroad as too cautious .
lawrence summers , a top economics advisor to us president barack obama , this week urged governments worldwide to pump more public money into their economies to revive falling global demand .
" no rift " with europe on tackling crisis the white house has been trying in recent days to steer clear of an out-and-out confrontation with europe over how to best handle a deep global recession .
while the united states would like to see more stimulus plans , europe has insisted on more financial regulations .
but white house spokesman robert gibbs said on monday president obama believes that regulation is needed to prevent a repeat of the present crisis in the future , and stimulus is required to get the economy moving now . " so i do n't think there 's any rift -lrb- with europe -rrb- at all , " gibbs told reporters .
world leaders are counting on a group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit in london next month to come up with global solutions for dealing with the financial crisis .
the us will use the london meeting to discuss " a number of subjects , both financial regulation and economic stimulus , largely because there is n't one single solution to those problems , " gibbs said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us would like to see more stimulus measures in europe the united states has a stimulus plan of nearly $ 790 billion -lrb- 626 billion euros -rrb- which it hopes will drag it out of what has shaped up to be the deepest recession in decades .
in the european union , countries have agreed to stimulus measures worth about 400 billion euros , the equivalent of 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic process , according to afp news agency .
europe wo n't see much improvement in 2009 economic recovery for the 16 countries which share the euro will not happen this year , eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said monday .
previous forecasts had predicted that the economies would pick up in late 2009 .
" the recovery will take longer than we were expecting only a few months ago , " almunia told journalists after a meeting with euro zone finance ministers in brussels .
the european commission forecast in january that the euro zone would contract 1.9 percent for the whole of 2009 before growing a measly 0.5 percent in 2010 .
" we 'll present a new forecast in may but taking into account the downside risks that have appeared and started to materialize after we presented the january forecasts , i tend to think that this scenario or gradual recovery will be -lrb- postponed -rrb- to 2010 , " almunia said . th / sp / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new data shows the country 's trade surplus for january was only half of the amount of a year ago . german exports dived 20.7 percent in january 2009 compared to a year ago , its biggest drop in the last 16 years . the world 's leading export nation exported 66.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 85 billion -rrb- worth of goods in january 2009 compared to 84 billion euros reported the previous year , according to preliminary figures released from the federal statistics office in wiesbaden on tuesday , march 10 . germany has been especially hard hit by the global recession , with a steep decline in its key export markets in europe and asia . " the growth engine of the german economy is out of fuel , " said ing economist carsten brzeski .
" any stabilization of the economy of the economy in 2007 will have to come from domestic demand , " he told the dpa news agency . sharper export decline in non-eu countries the decline marked germany 's fourth consecutive monthly drop in exports as europe 's largest economy faces its worst recession since the end of world war ii .
german exports to its partners in the euro zone fell by 18.7 percent from 2008 .
exports to non-eu countries plunged by 24.5 percent of 2008 levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's trade surplus dived to half in january from a year ago the sharp contraction in key industries such as engineering goods and the auto industry contributed significantly to the fall in exports . january 2009 imports also fell by 12.9 percent from 67 billion euros in 2008 to 58 billion euros .
the drop represents a 4.4 percent drop from december alone , making it the fourth consecutive monthly decline as well . commerzbank analyst simon junker told the afp news agency that " foreign trade is expected to have a sharp negative impact on growth again in the first quarter " of 2009 . german exports hard hit in eastern europe germany 's trade surplus was down to 8.5 billion euros , compared with double the amount - 17 billion euros - in january 2008 . a current account surplus , which is the broadest measure of trade activity that includes services and financial transfers , plunged more than three-fold to 4.2 billion euros from 15.6 billion euros , according to the federal statistics office . the german government expects output to shrink 2.25 percent this year . " so far , there are no visible signs of a fast recovery : the economies in industrial countries remain weak and the current crisis in eastern europe is a further strain , " commerzbank 's junker said . since a large proportion of germany 's european trade comes from countries in the former eastern bloc , which are not euro-zone members , a sharp depreciation of their currencies against the euro has hurt their purchasing power . df / sms / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but she said the g20 needs to include african nations more in the debate on financial reforms . nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma has been south africa 's minister of foreign affairs since 1999 .
she met with her german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier in berlin on monday , march 9 , as part of a four-nation european tour aimed at consolidating bilateral political , economic and trade relations between south africa and european countries . deutsche welle : what are the main common interests between germany and south africa ? nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma : we 're here at the invitation of the foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to strengthen our bilateral relations , which are already good .
but we want to be sure they remain so and grow : in economic cooperation , trade , science and technology and many other areas .

have you noticed this ? yes , we have noticed this growing interest and have been working very closely with germany .
in some instances , we work together in a third country in africa to strengthen peace and in programs of reconstruction , like in southern sudan and the democratic republic of congo .
we are very happy that germany is taking this particular interest because africa does need this support and also germany has been very supportive to the african union itself . the current economic crisis is challenging not only the african countries , but also the united states and european countries .
what are you expecting the g20 to do ? i think the g20 should reflect on the fact that africa will be very hard hit by this economic depression .
as they look at packages to salvage their own economies , g20 countries must be thinking about the economies of developing countries , particularly in africa .
also , regarding the millennium development goals , which were already a big challenge , if western countries do not continue giving development aid , those may be undermined and africa may be left out in terms of reaching those goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's development agency gtz is supporting a solar cooker project in south africa we also think that this is an opportunity for the transformation and reform of the bretton woods institutions -lrb- eds. note : the bretton woods system established the international bank for reconstruction and development and the international monetary fund -rrb- .
but we think that needs a broader discussion , not just within the g20 . we also think we need to look at opportunities that may arise from this depression .
if we look at alternative sources of energy , this may be an area of growth that countries like germany and others could invest in in developing countries .
there may be opportunities that we should be able to jointly explore that come from this unfortunate economic depression . you mention the reform of the bretton woods institutions .
do you think africa should have more voice in those institutions ? yes , i think so .
i think that developing countries , particularly in africa , should have a greater voice .
i think there 's a whole range of issues that would need to be looked at if we look at reforming the bretton woods institutions . the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- announced a warrant of arrest against sudanese president omar al-bashir last week .
south africa and others in africa said they regretted the court 's decision because of the indictment 's timing and because the warrant targets a sitting president .
in what way is this icc decision problematic to you ? if you look at sudan , particularly darfur , the african union has been grappling with that situation to try and find a peaceful settlement of that conflict .
of course , the sudanese government is crucial in the finding of that peaceful settlement .
at this point in time , when we are busy with that , there 's an indictment of a sitting president .
it does create problems because it may undermine the peace efforts . what are important for us are the millions of lives of those people in darfur - that they can get peace and begin rebuilding their lives .
we thought that this was really the wrong time and we tried to say , let the court defer it , even for a year .
it is provided for in the rome statutes -lrb- eds. note : the treaty that established the icc -rrb- .
we thought if this was deferred for a year - and to just give peace a chance - that would have been better . do you think the icc decision could provoke a new confrontation between international institutions like the icc and africa ? we just think it 's a pity that they took this decision at this point in time , which is undermining the work that the african union is trying to do . ute schaeffer interviewed nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

also , regarding the millennium development goals , which were already a big challenge , if western countries do not continue giving development aid , those may be undermined and africa may be left out in terms of reaching those goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's development agency gtz is supporting a solar cooker project in south africa we also think that this is an opportunity for the transformation and reform of the bretton woods institutions -lrb- eds. note : the bretton woods system established the international bank for reconstruction and development and the international monetary fund -rrb- .
but we think that needs a broader discussion , not just within the g20 . we also think we need to look at opportunities that may arise from this depression .
if we look at alternative sources of energy , this may be an area of growth that countries like germany and others could invest in in developing countries .
there may be opportunities that we should be able to jointly explore that come from this unfortunate economic depression . you mention the reform of the bretton woods institutions .
do you think africa should have more voice in those institutions ? yes , i think so .
i think that developing countries , particularly in africa , should have a greater voice .
i think there 's a whole range of issues that would need to be looked at if we look at reforming the bretton woods institutions . the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- announced a warrant of arrest against sudanese president omar al-bashir last week .
south africa and others in africa said they regretted the court 's decision because of the indictment 's timing and because the warrant targets a sitting president .
in what way is this icc decision problematic to you ? if you look at sudan , particularly darfur , the african union has been grappling with that situation to try and find a peaceful settlement of that conflict .
of course , the sudanese government is crucial in the finding of that peaceful settlement .
at this point in time , when we are busy with that , there 's an indictment of a sitting president .
it does create problems because it may undermine the peace efforts . what are important for us are the millions of lives of those people in darfur - that they can get peace and begin rebuilding their lives .
we thought that this was really the wrong time and we tried to say , let the court defer it , even for a year .
it is provided for in the rome statutes -lrb- eds. note : the treaty that established the icc -rrb- .
we thought if this was deferred for a year - and to just give peace a chance - that would have been better . do you think the icc decision could provoke a new confrontation between international institutions like the icc and africa ? we just think it 's a pity that they took this decision at this point in time , which is undermining the work that the african union is trying to do . ute schaeffer interviewed nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are not now winning the war , but the war is far from lost , " biden told a news conference after three hours of talks . afghan president hamid karzai said his government had long supported dialogue with those members of the taliban , who are not connected with " terrorists .

" the deteriorating situation in the region poses a security threat not just to the united states but to every single nation round this table , " biden told representatives of the 26-nation military alliance during a visit to brussels on tuesday , march 10 . " it was from the very same mountains that the attacks of 9/11 were planned , " he said , adding that nato should seek " pragmatic solutions " to its war in afghanistan . biden said options included direct talks with moderate factions of the taliban , most of whom are only involved in the insurgency for the money . " we are not now winning the war , but the war is far from lost , " biden told a news conference after three hours of talks . afghan president hamid karzai said his government had long supported dialogue with those members of the taliban , who are not connected with " terrorists . " election security boost needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security has worsened in afghanistan as the taliban regroups nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called on nato to boost efforts before afghan elections due in august .

" biden 's visit comes as us president barack obama pushes for a fresh strategy to fight the insurgency in afghanistan with more international support .
the us vice president stressed that the purpose of his trip was to listen to washington 's european allies . " when we consult , we get the type of consensus that our political leadership needs , " biden said .
" absent that kind of cohesion , it will be incredibly more difficult to meet the common threats we are going to face . " biden will be meeting with senior european union officials at eu headquarters in brussels later on tuesday . biden looking for concrete help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has boosted the number of troops in afghanistan the visit of obama 's second in command comes less than a week after a trip by us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton , who attended a nato foreign ministers ' meeting last thursday and met the european union 's foreign policy heads on friday . " this is not just lip service , the idea of consultation , we mean it , and in return we want concrete ideas and concrete assistance , " a senior obama administration official told afp news agency on condition of anonymity . violence in afghanistan was at its worst level in 2008 since the ouster of the taliban regime seven years ago . obama is reviewing how nato 's mission in afghanistan can turn the tide in the volatile south of the country , which has seen a steady rise in fighting and losses for us and allied countries . obama has ordered an interagency review to examine us policy on afghanistan and pakistan before a nato summit in april .
former cia official bruce riedel , now a senior fellow at the brookings institution think tank in washington , is heading the review . in addition to vowing to end us combat operations in iraq by august 2010 , he has also ordered the deployment of 17,000 troops to afghanistan , saying they were needed to stabilize a deteriorating security situation . call for more troops will fall on deaf ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is one of the nations under pressure to send more troops to afghanistan european allies expect the us to demand more troops for the war in afghanistan , and urge allies to remove restrictions on where their soldiers can fight . but some major nato partners have made clear that they are not in a position to send more soldiers into afghanistan , so top us officials have recently been stressing the need to boost political and development components of the afghan mission . " the united states recognizes that not all of our allies can contribute troops but we appreciate other forms of assistance equally , " the senior official , quoted by afp , said .

net profit for 2008 was 1.6 billion euros .
" we made significant headway in reshaping the company , " louis gallois , chief executive of eads said .
although 2009 would be " challenging " due to an expected overall slump in aircraft orders amid the global economic recession , gallois said that " 2009 deliveries should remain at high levels . "
better results than forecast last year airbus delivered a record 483 aircraft , surpassing its chief competitor , the us-based boeing .
eads said cost cutting measures at its airbus division was largely responsible for its robust profits . the net profits also turned out to be better than expected .
industry analysts polled by dow jones newswires , had forecast a net profit of only 1.3 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads military aircraft will be integrated into its airbus division in addition to airbus passenger jets , eads also manufactures military aircraft , rockets , satellites and defense communications systems .
setback in eads military division the company admitted that its new a400m military transport aircraft has been beset with technical problems , forcing it to delay its first flight .
but gallois remained optimistic about the company 's prospects .
" even if the a400m program required enormous attention , the group has regained stability in 2008 and is proving to be resilient in the face of the turbulent global economic environment , " he said .
last month , eads announced it would integrate the military transport aircraft division into its airbus commercial airliner operation , and named a spanish aeronautical engineer domingo urena-raso to head the separate airbus military unit .
on monday , the german defense ministry confirmed its order for the a400m transporter after a news report had suggested the contract would be cancelled .
besides germany , france and ten other nations have ordered the turbo-prop military plane , which resembles its us counterpart the lockheed martin c-130 hercules .
in berlin , a defense ministry spokesman said that in spite of production delays , germany needed the 60 planes on order , explaining that it was the final delivery date , rather than the test-flight date that mattered .
altogether eads has 192 a400m transporters worth 20 billion euros on order .
berlin , paris offer credit lines to aircraft buyers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin and paris have pledged financial support for eads the german government also joined france on tuesday in helping buyers of commercial airbus jets by offering credit lines amid fears international banks might restrict lending .
germany 's federal bank kfw and its export credit guarantees agency hermes will permit customers to continue buying airbus aircraft .
" the objective is to help reliable customers abroad to solve their financing problems , thus securing exports of our planes , " peter hintze the german government 's aerospace co-ordinator told dpa news agency .
paris is also launching a similar program to encourage sales of airbus jets . eads is a european consortium dominated by german and french shareholder interests .
the french business daily les echos said that five billion euros in credit from the french government would help cash-strapped airlines honor their commitments to airbus orders as well as other eads products . more than 40 percent of eads stock is publicly traded on several european stock exchanges . unlike many companies that cut dividends to shareholders because of the economic slump , eads said it would pay 20 cents per share for 2008 , up from 12 cents the previous year . df / sp / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are ways of honoring someone you admire , and then there are simply poor ideas .
two german discount food retailers have hit upon the latter by naming their new fried chicken product " obama fingers . " " haehnchenstueckchen paniert nach suedstaatenart " ... that 's the clumsy german translation for " southern fried chicken , " and two supermarket discounters have displayed a likewise maladroit understanding of american culture in bringing out a new frozen food delicacy . apparently unaware of the historically racist stereotypes connected this particular food item in the united states , the plus and netto food retailers have chosen to pay homage to everybody 's favorite leader of the free world by using his name for 500-gram packages of ready-to-be-reheated bird parts . the packaging features a picture of something remotely resembling the golden gate bridge - the statue of liberty was presumably unavailable for the photo shoot - and is part of a seven-day trial " america week " the supermarkets are conducting . bizarrely , the chicken snacks also come with curry sauce - not exactly a typical condiment south of the mason-dixon line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's he going to use now to make a point ?
a spokesperson for the manufacturer told ap news agency the company hoped to cash on obama 's charisma and boost sales on the back of the president 's popularity . admirable honesty , but charisma - as history teaches us - tends not to be transferrable to things that are hacked apart , stuffed inside a cardboard box and deep frozen . the fingers will probably be off the shelves by april 3 , when their namesake is scheduled to visit german chancellor angela merkel . but if they 're not , the chancellor should be wary causing utter befuddlement and potential offense to her guest - and simply serve him up some good old german sausage . jc / sms / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but she said the g20 needs to include african nations more in the debate on financial reforms . nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma has been south africa 's minister of foreign affairs since 1999 .
she met with her german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier in berlin on monday , march 9 , as part of a four-nation european tour aimed at consolidating bilateral political , economic and trade relations between south africa and european countries . deutsche welle : what are the main common interests between germany and south africa ? nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma : we 're here at the invitation of the foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to strengthen our bilateral relations , which are already good .
but we want to be sure they remain so and grow : in economic cooperation , trade , science and technology and many other areas .
we are very like-minded in many multi-lateral issues , so we share a lot of views in the un and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa is hosting the world cup in 2010 of course , with germany having hosted the fifa world cup , we 're also making use of their experience for our own 2010 world cup and germany has been sharing its experiences with us . foreign minister steinmeier has started many initiatives concerning africa , and there has really been an emphasis placed on african policy here in germany .
have you noticed this ? yes , we have noticed this growing interest and have been working very closely with germany .
in some instances , we work together in a third country in africa to strengthen peace and in programs of reconstruction , like in southern sudan and the democratic republic of congo .
we are very happy that germany is taking this particular interest because africa does need this support and also germany has been very supportive to the african union itself . the current economic crisis is challenging not only the african countries , but also the united states and european countries .
what are you expecting the g20 to do ? i think the g20 should reflect on the fact that africa will be very hard hit by this economic depression .
as they look at packages to salvage their own economies , g20 countries must be thinking about the economies of developing countries , particularly in africa .
also , regarding the millennium development goals , which were already a big challenge , if western countries do not continue giving development aid , those may be undermined and africa may be left out in terms of reaching those goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's development agency gtz is supporting a solar cooker project in south africa we also think that this is an opportunity for the transformation and reform of the bretton woods institutions -lrb- eds. note : the bretton woods system established the international bank for reconstruction and development and the international monetary fund -rrb- .
but we think that needs a broader discussion , not just within the g20 . we also think we need to look at opportunities that may arise from this depression .
if we look at alternative sources of energy , this may be an area of growth that countries like germany and others could invest in in developing countries .
there may be opportunities that we should be able to jointly explore that come from this unfortunate economic depression . you mention the reform of the bretton woods institutions .
do you think africa should have more voice in those institutions ? yes , i think so .
i think that developing countries , particularly in africa , should have a greater voice .
i think there 's a whole range of issues that would need to be looked at if we look at reforming the bretton woods institutions . the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- announced a warrant of arrest against sudanese president omar al-bashir last week .
south africa and others in africa said they regretted the court 's decision because of the indictment 's timing and because the warrant targets a sitting president .
in what way is this icc decision problematic to you ? if you look at sudan , particularly darfur , the african union has been grappling with that situation to try and find a peaceful settlement of that conflict .
of course , the sudanese government is crucial in the finding of that peaceful settlement .
at this point in time , when we are busy with that , there 's an indictment of a sitting president .
it does create problems because it may undermine the peace efforts . what are important for us are the millions of lives of those people in darfur - that they can get peace and begin rebuilding their lives .
we thought that this was really the wrong time and we tried to say , let the court defer it , even for a year .
it is provided for in the rome statutes -lrb- eds. note : the treaty that established the icc -rrb- .
we thought if this was deferred for a year - and to just give peace a chance - that would have been better . do you think the icc decision could provoke a new confrontation between international institutions like the icc and africa ? we just think it 's a pity that they took this decision at this point in time , which is undermining the work that the african union is trying to do . ute schaeffer interviewed nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but she said the g20 needs to include african nations more in the debate on financial reforms . nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma has been south africa 's minister of foreign affairs since 1999 .
she met with her german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier in berlin on monday , march 9 , as part of a four-nation european tour aimed at consolidating bilateral political , economic and trade relations between south africa and european countries . deutsche welle : what are the main common interests between germany and south africa ? nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma : we 're here at the invitation of the foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to strengthen our bilateral relations , which are already good .
but we want to be sure they remain so and grow : in economic cooperation , trade , science and technology and many other areas .
we are very like-minded in many multi-lateral issues , so we share a lot of views in the un and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa is hosting the world cup in 2010 of course , with germany having hosted the fifa world cup , we 're also making use of their experience for our own 2010 world cup and germany has been sharing its experiences with us . foreign minister steinmeier has started many initiatives concerning africa , and there has really been an emphasis placed on african policy here in germany .
have you noticed this ? yes , we have noticed this growing interest and have been working very closely with germany .
in some instances , we work together in a third country in africa to strengthen peace and in programs of reconstruction , like in southern sudan and the democratic republic of congo .
we are very happy that germany is taking this particular interest because africa does need this support and also germany has been very supportive to the african union itself . the current economic crisis is challenging not only the african countries , but also the united states and european countries .
what are you expecting the g20 to do ? i think the g20 should reflect on the fact that africa will be very hard hit by this economic depression .
as they look at packages to salvage their own economies , g20 countries must be thinking about the economies of developing countries , particularly in africa .
also , regarding the millennium development goals , which were already a big challenge , if western countries do not continue giving development aid , those may be undermined and africa may be left out in terms of reaching those goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's development agency gtz is supporting a solar cooker project in south africa we also think that this is an opportunity for the transformation and reform of the bretton woods institutions -lrb- eds. note : the bretton woods system established the international bank for reconstruction and development and the international monetary fund -rrb- .
but we think that needs a broader discussion , not just within the g20 . we also think we need to look at opportunities that may arise from this depression .
if we look at alternative sources of energy , this may be an area of growth that countries like germany and others could invest in in developing countries .
there may be opportunities that we should be able to jointly explore that come from this unfortunate economic depression . you mention the reform of the bretton woods institutions .
do you think africa should have more voice in those institutions ? yes , i think so .
i think that developing countries , particularly in africa , should have a greater voice .
i think there 's a whole range of issues that would need to be looked at if we look at reforming the bretton woods institutions . the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- announced a warrant of arrest against sudanese president omar al-bashir last week .
south africa and others in africa said they regretted the court 's decision because of the indictment 's timing and because the warrant targets a sitting president .
in what way is this icc decision problematic to you ? if you look at sudan , particularly darfur , the african union has been grappling with that situation to try and find a peaceful settlement of that conflict .
of course , the sudanese government is crucial in the finding of that peaceful settlement .
at this point in time , when we are busy with that , there 's an indictment of a sitting president .
it does create problems because it may undermine the peace efforts . what are important for us are the millions of lives of those people in darfur - that they can get peace and begin rebuilding their lives .

that 's the question for the european central bank , which is pondering further cuts in interest rates .
but experts disagree on the benefits of bottoming out rates to stimulate growth . with the ecb 's prime lending rate currently at a record low of 1.5 percent , getting euros has never been so cheap .
but a host of leading bankers have said the rate will have to fall even further if the ecb wants to fight the effects of global economic and financial crisis . indeed , one member of the ecb 's executive board has broken a long-standing taboo and talking about the possibility of a 0 percent interest rate . " if the economic situation worsens , the ecb is ready for further interest rate cuts - even down to zero , " board member lorenzo bini smaghi told the german financial newspaper boersen-zeitung on tuesday , march 10 . smaghi stressed that such an option would only come in for consideration if the euro-zone economy was hit by deflation .
but the mere fact that he mentioned it as a possibility signals how nervous europe 's leading bankers are these days about the prospects for economic recovery . broad consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet has denied that zero is an option , but other experts say it might be still , interest rates are unlikely to hit rock-bottom in the immediate future .
the head of the ecb , jean-claude trichet , has said in the past that a 0 percent interest rate is not on the agenda , and the head of germany 's national bank , axel weber , was quick to reject the option . " i see 1 percent as the lower limit to which the primary refinancing rate can fall , " bundesbank president weber said at a press conference on tuesday . but weber , who is also an ecb director , seemed to indicate that he would support further , smaller cuts in the prime lending rate , as did his ecb colleague juergen stark . " of course , there 's still certain room for monetary-policy maneuvering , " stark , who is responsible for the ecb 's economic and monetary analysis , told reuters news agency on monday . the us federal reserve and the bank of japan has effectively set their main rates at zero . creativity needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb says it 's looking for other ways to boast the economy but at the same time as the experts were suggesting further cuts in rates , they also cautioned against seeing such a strategy as a cure-all for the euro zone 's economic woes . " it wo n't be able to fundamentally solve the problems caused by the financial crisis , " stark said , adding that interest rates that were too low could actually worsen the euro zone 's current difficulties . the european central bank is also looking to explore other avenues to stimulate the bloc 's economy . " we will continue to consult about how - above and beyond interest-rate cuts - we can provide monetary-policy impulses , " weber said . it 's unclear what those alternative measures could be , but they will not include buying government bonds .

since there were no german crew members and the vessel was sailing under an antiguan flag , prosecutors in berlin stated that national interests were not sufficiently at stake to try the captives in germany . although most pirates operating in the gulf of aden are from somalia , a former italian colony located in the horn of africa , the nation lacks a functioning legal system to stage a proper trial . handover possible after eu-kenyan deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since last year 24 pirates in all were handed over to kenya but kenya , which borders somalia to the southwest , has a justice system that meets the requirements set by germany , although human rights advocates have been critical of prison conditions there . human rights watch has said that inmates could be held in detention for months without any charges being pressed and are often denied legal counsel . tuesday 's handover was only possible after an agreement between the european union and kenya had paved the way for somali nationals to be prosecuted in kenya . the eu had specified in a deal last week that the captives can not be subjected to torture or the death sentence .
they would have the right to appear before a judge in a short period of time , would be entitled to legal representation and would be provided with an interpreter if needed . gulf of aden vulnerable to attack kenya 's marine police commander stanley lenamai told the associated press that the suspected pirates , who had arrived in the port city mombasa on tuesday , will be taken to court as soon as interpreters for them are found . the nine suspects bring the total number of people delivered to kenyan courts by foreign navies to 24 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirates demanded $ 25 million for super-tanker sirius star and crew more than 100 ships were attacked last year by pirates off the coast of somalia .

that 's after the bundesbank - the country 's national bank - posted 6.3 billion euros in profits for last year .
but falling interest rates could bring a downturn . bundesbank president axel weber announced the rise in profits at a news conference in frankfurt am main on tuesday , march 10 . the bank , he said , had earned the equivalent of $ 8 billion in 2008 - an increase of around 50 percent over the previous year . " despite the hefty increase in reserves , the bundesbank 's profits are markedly higher , " weber said . the entire sum earned is being transferred to the federal government - which is something of a novelty .
in previous years , portions of the bundesbank 's earnings have had to be used to pay off debt from the former east germany , but now that the debt is gone , the bank 's profits will flow into state coffers . the additional 6.3 billion euros will come as very welcome news to chancellor angela merkel 's government , which is looking for every spare euro it can find after agreeing to engage in deficit spending in an attempt to combat the effects of the global financial and economic crisis . the government has already promised billions in bail-outs to the banking industry and said it would consider loan guarantees and other rescue measures to other industries . prime rate key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesbank president weber had good news and bad news weber said most of the bank 's profits had been earned from lending money to banks . " the increase is above all due to profits on interest in euros , " weber explained at the press conference , adding that the increased value of the bank 's assets in us dollars and its gold reserves had also contributed to the positive figures . but that news is also cause for concern due to the current downward trend in european interest rates . the european central bank 's prime lending rate prior to the outbreak of the financial crisis in the second half of 2008 stood at 4.25 percent . the ecb has since slashed it to a mere 1.5 percent , and many commentators are saying further rate decreases , perhaps all the way down to zero , may be necessary . such a step could dramatically reduce the bundesbank 's profits for 2009 . no dancing in the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank probably ca n't expect the same results for 2009 despite the good coming his own institution , weber himself painted a gloomy picture of the economic future - both globally and for germany in particular . " because of declining demands for experts , the german economy is especially affected , " he said , referring to the economic crisis . weber said he expected the 2009 inflation rate in germany to be 0 percent - a figure that gives rise to fears of deflation and worries that the recession could turn into a full-scale economic depression . but weber said he did not think deflation was a serious danger . jc / sms / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

net profit for 2008 was 1.6 billion euros .
" we made significant headway in reshaping the company , " louis gallois , chief executive of eads said .
although 2009 would be " challenging " due to an expected overall slump in aircraft orders amid the global economic recession , gallois said that " 2009 deliveries should remain at high levels . "
better results than forecast last year airbus delivered a record 483 aircraft , surpassing its chief competitor , the us-based boeing .
eads said cost cutting measures at its airbus division was largely responsible for its robust profits . the net profits also turned out to be better than expected .

but gallois remained optimistic about the company 's prospects .
" even if the a400m program required enormous attention , the group has regained stability in 2008 and is proving to be resilient in the face of the turbulent global economic environment , " he said .
last month , eads announced it would integrate the military transport aircraft division into its airbus commercial airliner operation , and named a spanish aeronautical engineer domingo urena-raso to head the separate airbus military unit .
on monday , the german defense ministry confirmed its order for the a400m transporter after a news report had suggested the contract would be cancelled .
besides germany , france and ten other nations have ordered the turbo-prop military plane , which resembles its us counterpart the lockheed martin c-130 hercules .
in berlin , a defense ministry spokesman said that in spite of production delays , germany needed the 60 planes on order , explaining that it was the final delivery date , rather than the test-flight date that mattered .

paris is also launching a similar program to encourage sales of airbus jets . eads is a european consortium dominated by german and french shareholder interests .
the french business daily les echos said that five billion euros in credit from the french government would help cash-strapped airlines honor their commitments to airbus orders as well as other eads products . more than 40 percent of eads stock is publicly traded on several european stock exchanges . unlike many companies that cut dividends to shareholders because of the economic slump , eads said it would pay 20 cents per share for 2008 , up from 12 cents the previous year . df / sp / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's the question for the european central bank , which is pondering further cuts in interest rates .
but experts disagree on the benefits of bottoming out rates to stimulate growth . with the ecb 's prime lending rate currently at a record low of 1.5 percent , getting euros has never been so cheap .
but a host of leading bankers have said the rate will have to fall even further if the ecb wants to fight the effects of global economic and financial crisis . indeed , one member of the ecb 's executive board has broken a long-standing taboo and talking about the possibility of a 0 percent interest rate . " if the economic situation worsens , the ecb is ready for further interest rate cuts - even down to zero , " board member lorenzo bini smaghi told the german financial newspaper boersen-zeitung on tuesday , march 10 . smaghi stressed that such an option would only come in for consideration if the euro-zone economy was hit by deflation .
but the mere fact that he mentioned it as a possibility signals how nervous europe 's leading bankers are these days about the prospects for economic recovery . broad consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet has denied that zero is an option , but other experts say it might be still , interest rates are unlikely to hit rock-bottom in the immediate future .

" of course , there 's still certain room for monetary-policy maneuvering , " stark , who is responsible for the ecb 's economic and monetary analysis , told reuters news agency on monday . the us federal reserve and the bank of japan has effectively set their main rates at zero . creativity needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb says it 's looking for other ways to boast the economy but at the same time as the experts were suggesting further cuts in rates , they also cautioned against seeing such a strategy as a cure-all for the euro zone 's economic woes . " it wo n't be able to fundamentally solve the problems caused by the financial crisis , " stark said , adding that interest rates that were too low could actually worsen the euro zone 's current difficulties . the european central bank is also looking to explore other avenues to stimulate the bloc 's economy . " we will continue to consult about how - above and beyond interest-rate cuts - we can provide monetary-policy impulses , " weber said . it 's unclear what those alternative measures could be , but they will not include buying government bonds .

that 's the question for the european central bank , which is pondering further cuts in interest rates .
but experts disagree on the benefits of bottoming out rates to stimulate growth . with the ecb 's prime lending rate currently at a record low of 1.5 percent , getting euros has never been so cheap .
but a host of leading bankers have said the rate will have to fall even further if the ecb wants to fight the effects of global economic and financial crisis . indeed , one member of the ecb 's executive board has broken a long-standing taboo and talking about the possibility of a 0 percent interest rate . " if the economic situation worsens , the ecb is ready for further interest rate cuts - even down to zero , " board member lorenzo bini smaghi told the german financial newspaper boersen-zeitung on tuesday , march 10 . smaghi stressed that such an option would only come in for consideration if the euro-zone economy was hit by deflation .
but the mere fact that he mentioned it as a possibility signals how nervous europe 's leading bankers are these days about the prospects for economic recovery . broad consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet has denied that zero is an option , but other experts say it might be still , interest rates are unlikely to hit rock-bottom in the immediate future .
the head of the ecb , jean-claude trichet , has said in the past that a 0 percent interest rate is not on the agenda , and the head of germany 's national bank , axel weber , was quick to reject the option . " i see 1 percent as the lower limit to which the primary refinancing rate can fall , " bundesbank president weber said at a press conference on tuesday . but weber , who is also an ecb director , seemed to indicate that he would support further , smaller cuts in the prime lending rate , as did his ecb colleague juergen stark . " of course , there 's still certain room for monetary-policy maneuvering , " stark , who is responsible for the ecb 's economic and monetary analysis , told reuters news agency on monday . the us federal reserve and the bank of japan has effectively set their main rates at zero . creativity needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb says it 's looking for other ways to boast the economy but at the same time as the experts were suggesting further cuts in rates , they also cautioned against seeing such a strategy as a cure-all for the euro zone 's economic woes . " it wo n't be able to fundamentally solve the problems caused by the financial crisis , " stark said , adding that interest rates that were too low could actually worsen the euro zone 's current difficulties . the european central bank is also looking to explore other avenues to stimulate the bloc 's economy . " we will continue to consult about how - above and beyond interest-rate cuts - we can provide monetary-policy impulses , " weber said . it 's unclear what those alternative measures could be , but they will not include buying government bonds .
the experts reject that idea , which has been used , for example , in england , as being contrary to the spirit of fair competition with the euro zone . jc / sms / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german lawmakers this year passed an stimulus package worth 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 63 billion -rrb- to haul europe 's largest economy out of its worst recession in decades .
it includes investments in infrastructure , tax relief , reductions in health care contributions and money for families with children .

that 's after the bundesbank - the country 's national bank - posted 6.3 billion euros in profits for last year .
but falling interest rates could bring a downturn . bundesbank president axel weber announced the rise in profits at a news conference in frankfurt am main on tuesday , march 10 . the bank , he said , had earned the equivalent of $ 8 billion in 2008 - an increase of around 50 percent over the previous year . " despite the hefty increase in reserves , the bundesbank 's profits are markedly higher , " weber said . the entire sum earned is being transferred to the federal government - which is something of a novelty .
in previous years , portions of the bundesbank 's earnings have had to be used to pay off debt from the former east germany , but now that the debt is gone , the bank 's profits will flow into state coffers . the additional 6.3 billion euros will come as very welcome news to chancellor angela merkel 's government , which is looking for every spare euro it can find after agreeing to engage in deficit spending in an attempt to combat the effects of the global financial and economic crisis . the government has already promised billions in bail-outs to the banking industry and said it would consider loan guarantees and other rescue measures to other industries . prime rate key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesbank president weber had good news and bad news weber said most of the bank 's profits had been earned from lending money to banks . " the increase is above all due to profits on interest in euros , " weber explained at the press conference , adding that the increased value of the bank 's assets in us dollars and its gold reserves had also contributed to the positive figures . but that news is also cause for concern due to the current downward trend in european interest rates . the european central bank 's prime lending rate prior to the outbreak of the financial crisis in the second half of 2008 stood at 4.25 percent . the ecb has since slashed it to a mere 1.5 percent , and many commentators are saying further rate decreases , perhaps all the way down to zero , may be necessary . such a step could dramatically reduce the bundesbank 's profits for 2009 . no dancing in the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank probably ca n't expect the same results for 2009 despite the good coming his own institution , weber himself painted a gloomy picture of the economic future - both globally and for germany in particular . " because of declining demands for experts , the german economy is especially affected , " he said , referring to the economic crisis . weber said he expected the 2009 inflation rate in germany to be 0 percent - a figure that gives rise to fears of deflation and worries that the recession could turn into a full-scale economic depression . but weber said he did not think deflation was a serious danger . jc / sms / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they would have the right to appear before a judge in a short period of time , would be entitled to legal representation and would be provided with an interpreter if needed . gulf of aden vulnerable to attack kenya 's marine police commander stanley lenamai told the associated press that the suspected pirates , who had arrived in the port city mombasa on tuesday , will be taken to court as soon as interpreters for them are found . the nine suspects bring the total number of people delivered to kenyan courts by foreign navies to 24 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirates demanded $ 25 million for super-tanker sirius star and crew more than 100 ships were attacked last year by pirates off the coast of somalia .
the gulf of aden is a vital transit route leading to the suez canal , where roughly 30 percent of the world 's oil is transported . nato , the eu and other countries , including russia and china , have deployed warships to fight piracy and protect the lucrative multi-billion dollar shipping lanes from the heavily armed pirates who use high-powered speedboats to launch their attacks and kidnap crew members . the german frigate that apprehended the nine men is part of the eu 's anti-piracy mission atalanta . df / sms / dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are ways of honoring someone you admire , and then there are simply poor ideas .
two german discount food retailers have hit upon the latter by naming their new fried chicken product " obama fingers . " " haehnchenstueckchen paniert nach suedstaatenart " ... that 's the clumsy german translation for " southern fried chicken , " and two supermarket discounters have displayed a likewise maladroit understanding of american culture in bringing out a new frozen food delicacy . apparently unaware of the historically racist stereotypes connected this particular food item in the united states , the plus and netto food retailers have chosen to pay homage to everybody 's favorite leader of the free world by using his name for 500-gram packages of ready-to-be-reheated bird parts . the packaging features a picture of something remotely resembling the golden gate bridge - the statue of liberty was presumably unavailable for the photo shoot - and is part of a seven-day trial " america week " the supermarkets are conducting . bizarrely , the chicken snacks also come with curry sauce - not exactly a typical condiment south of the mason-dixon line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's he going to use now to make a point ?
a spokesperson for the manufacturer told ap news agency the company hoped to cash on obama 's charisma and boost sales on the back of the president 's popularity . admirable honesty , but charisma - as history teaches us - tends not to be transferrable to things that are hacked apart , stuffed inside a cardboard box and deep frozen . the fingers will probably be off the shelves by april 3 , when their namesake is scheduled to visit german chancellor angela merkel . but if they 're not , the chancellor should be wary causing utter befuddlement and potential offense to her guest - and simply serve him up some good old german sausage . jc / sms / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but she said the g20 needs to include african nations more in the debate on financial reforms . nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma has been south africa 's minister of foreign affairs since 1999 .
she met with her german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier in berlin on monday , march 9 , as part of a four-nation european tour aimed at consolidating bilateral political , economic and trade relations between south africa and european countries . deutsche welle : what are the main common interests between germany and south africa ? nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma : we 're here at the invitation of the foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to strengthen our bilateral relations , which are already good .

have you noticed this ? yes , we have noticed this growing interest and have been working very closely with germany .
in some instances , we work together in a third country in africa to strengthen peace and in programs of reconstruction , like in southern sudan and the democratic republic of congo .
we are very happy that germany is taking this particular interest because africa does need this support and also germany has been very supportive to the african union itself . the current economic crisis is challenging not only the african countries , but also the united states and european countries .
what are you expecting the g20 to do ? i think the g20 should reflect on the fact that africa will be very hard hit by this economic depression .
as they look at packages to salvage their own economies , g20 countries must be thinking about the economies of developing countries , particularly in africa .

i think that developing countries , particularly in africa , should have a greater voice .
i think there 's a whole range of issues that would need to be looked at if we look at reforming the bretton woods institutions . the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- announced a warrant of arrest against sudanese president omar al-bashir last week .
south africa and others in africa said they regretted the court 's decision because of the indictment 's timing and because the warrant targets a sitting president .

as a major oil transit route , somalia 's coast is prone to pirate attacks . germany turned over nine pirates , arrested for attacking a merchant vessel in the gulf of aden off the somali coast last week , to kenya on tuesday , march 10 . the german navy frigate rheinland pfalz had seized the alleged pirates when they used bazookas and firearms to attack a german-owned merchant vessel .
since there were no german crew members and the vessel was sailing under an antiguan flag , prosecutors in berlin stated that national interests were not sufficiently at stake to try the captives in germany . although most pirates operating in the gulf of aden are from somalia , a former italian colony located in the horn of africa , the nation lacks a functioning legal system to stage a proper trial . handover possible after eu-kenyan deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since last year 24 pirates in all were handed over to kenya but kenya , which borders somalia to the southwest , has a justice system that meets the requirements set by germany , although human rights advocates have been critical of prison conditions there . human rights watch has said that inmates could be held in detention for months without any charges being pressed and are often denied legal counsel . tuesday 's handover was only possible after an agreement between the european union and kenya had paved the way for somali nationals to be prosecuted in kenya . the eu had specified in a deal last week that the captives can not be subjected to torture or the death sentence .
they would have the right to appear before a judge in a short period of time , would be entitled to legal representation and would be provided with an interpreter if needed . gulf of aden vulnerable to attack kenya 's marine police commander stanley lenamai told the associated press that the suspected pirates , who had arrived in the port city mombasa on tuesday , will be taken to court as soon as interpreters for them are found . the nine suspects bring the total number of people delivered to kenyan courts by foreign navies to 24 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirates demanded $ 25 million for super-tanker sirius star and crew more than 100 ships were attacked last year by pirates off the coast of somalia .
the gulf of aden is a vital transit route leading to the suez canal , where roughly 30 percent of the world 's oil is transported . nato , the eu and other countries , including russia and china , have deployed warships to fight piracy and protect the lucrative multi-billion dollar shipping lanes from the heavily armed pirates who use high-powered speedboats to launch their attacks and kidnap crew members . the german frigate that apprehended the nine men is part of the eu 's anti-piracy mission atalanta . df / sms / dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but she said the g20 needs to include african nations more in the debate on financial reforms . nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma has been south africa 's minister of foreign affairs since 1999 .
she met with her german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier in berlin on monday , march 9 , as part of a four-nation european tour aimed at consolidating bilateral political , economic and trade relations between south africa and european countries . deutsche welle : what are the main common interests between germany and south africa ? nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma : we 're here at the invitation of the foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to strengthen our bilateral relations , which are already good .
but we want to be sure they remain so and grow : in economic cooperation , trade , science and technology and many other areas .
we are very like-minded in many multi-lateral issues , so we share a lot of views in the un and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa is hosting the world cup in 2010 of course , with germany having hosted the fifa world cup , we 're also making use of their experience for our own 2010 world cup and germany has been sharing its experiences with us . foreign minister steinmeier has started many initiatives concerning africa , and there has really been an emphasis placed on african policy here in germany .
have you noticed this ? yes , we have noticed this growing interest and have been working very closely with germany .
in some instances , we work together in a third country in africa to strengthen peace and in programs of reconstruction , like in southern sudan and the democratic republic of congo .
we are very happy that germany is taking this particular interest because africa does need this support and also germany has been very supportive to the african union itself . the current economic crisis is challenging not only the african countries , but also the united states and european countries .
what are you expecting the g20 to do ? i think the g20 should reflect on the fact that africa will be very hard hit by this economic depression .
as they look at packages to salvage their own economies , g20 countries must be thinking about the economies of developing countries , particularly in africa .
also , regarding the millennium development goals , which were already a big challenge , if western countries do not continue giving development aid , those may be undermined and africa may be left out in terms of reaching those goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's development agency gtz is supporting a solar cooker project in south africa we also think that this is an opportunity for the transformation and reform of the bretton woods institutions -lrb- eds. note : the bretton woods system established the international bank for reconstruction and development and the international monetary fund -rrb- .
but we think that needs a broader discussion , not just within the g20 . we also think we need to look at opportunities that may arise from this depression .
if we look at alternative sources of energy , this may be an area of growth that countries like germany and others could invest in in developing countries .
there may be opportunities that we should be able to jointly explore that come from this unfortunate economic depression . you mention the reform of the bretton woods institutions .
do you think africa should have more voice in those institutions ? yes , i think so .
i think that developing countries , particularly in africa , should have a greater voice .
i think there 's a whole range of issues that would need to be looked at if we look at reforming the bretton woods institutions . the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- announced a warrant of arrest against sudanese president omar al-bashir last week .
south africa and others in africa said they regretted the court 's decision because of the indictment 's timing and because the warrant targets a sitting president .
in what way is this icc decision problematic to you ? if you look at sudan , particularly darfur , the african union has been grappling with that situation to try and find a peaceful settlement of that conflict .
of course , the sudanese government is crucial in the finding of that peaceful settlement .
at this point in time , when we are busy with that , there 's an indictment of a sitting president .
it does create problems because it may undermine the peace efforts . what are important for us are the millions of lives of those people in darfur - that they can get peace and begin rebuilding their lives .
we thought that this was really the wrong time and we tried to say , let the court defer it , even for a year .
it is provided for in the rome statutes -lrb- eds. note : the treaty that established the icc -rrb- .
we thought if this was deferred for a year - and to just give peace a chance - that would have been better . do you think the icc decision could provoke a new confrontation between international institutions like the icc and africa ? we just think it 's a pity that they took this decision at this point in time , which is undermining the work that the african union is trying to do . ute schaeffer interviewed nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but she said the g20 needs to include african nations more in the debate on financial reforms . nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma has been south africa 's minister of foreign affairs since 1999 .
she met with her german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier in berlin on monday , march 9 , as part of a four-nation european tour aimed at consolidating bilateral political , economic and trade relations between south africa and european countries . deutsche welle : what are the main common interests between germany and south africa ? nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma : we 're here at the invitation of the foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to strengthen our bilateral relations , which are already good .
but we want to be sure they remain so and grow : in economic cooperation , trade , science and technology and many other areas .
we are very like-minded in many multi-lateral issues , so we share a lot of views in the un and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa is hosting the world cup in 2010 of course , with germany having hosted the fifa world cup , we 're also making use of their experience for our own 2010 world cup and germany has been sharing its experiences with us . foreign minister steinmeier has started many initiatives concerning africa , and there has really been an emphasis placed on african policy here in germany .
have you noticed this ? yes , we have noticed this growing interest and have been working very closely with germany .
in some instances , we work together in a third country in africa to strengthen peace and in programs of reconstruction , like in southern sudan and the democratic republic of congo .
we are very happy that germany is taking this particular interest because africa does need this support and also germany has been very supportive to the african union itself . the current economic crisis is challenging not only the african countries , but also the united states and european countries .
what are you expecting the g20 to do ? i think the g20 should reflect on the fact that africa will be very hard hit by this economic depression .
as they look at packages to salvage their own economies , g20 countries must be thinking about the economies of developing countries , particularly in africa .
also , regarding the millennium development goals , which were already a big challenge , if western countries do not continue giving development aid , those may be undermined and africa may be left out in terms of reaching those goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's development agency gtz is supporting a solar cooker project in south africa we also think that this is an opportunity for the transformation and reform of the bretton woods institutions -lrb- eds. note : the bretton woods system established the international bank for reconstruction and development and the international monetary fund -rrb- .
but we think that needs a broader discussion , not just within the g20 . we also think we need to look at opportunities that may arise from this depression .
if we look at alternative sources of energy , this may be an area of growth that countries like germany and others could invest in in developing countries .
there may be opportunities that we should be able to jointly explore that come from this unfortunate economic depression . you mention the reform of the bretton woods institutions .
do you think africa should have more voice in those institutions ? yes , i think so .
i think that developing countries , particularly in africa , should have a greater voice .
i think there 's a whole range of issues that would need to be looked at if we look at reforming the bretton woods institutions . the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- announced a warrant of arrest against sudanese president omar al-bashir last week .
south africa and others in africa said they regretted the court 's decision because of the indictment 's timing and because the warrant targets a sitting president .
in what way is this icc decision problematic to you ? if you look at sudan , particularly darfur , the african union has been grappling with that situation to try and find a peaceful settlement of that conflict .
of course , the sudanese government is crucial in the finding of that peaceful settlement .
at this point in time , when we are busy with that , there 's an indictment of a sitting president .
it does create problems because it may undermine the peace efforts . what are important for us are the millions of lives of those people in darfur - that they can get peace and begin rebuilding their lives .

net profit for 2008 was 1.6 billion euros .
" we made significant headway in reshaping the company , " louis gallois , chief executive of eads said .
although 2009 would be " challenging " due to an expected overall slump in aircraft orders amid the global economic recession , gallois said that " 2009 deliveries should remain at high levels . "
better results than forecast last year airbus delivered a record 483 aircraft , surpassing its chief competitor , the us-based boeing .
eads said cost cutting measures at its airbus division was largely responsible for its robust profits . the net profits also turned out to be better than expected .

but gallois remained optimistic about the company 's prospects .
" even if the a400m program required enormous attention , the group has regained stability in 2008 and is proving to be resilient in the face of the turbulent global economic environment , " he said .
last month , eads announced it would integrate the military transport aircraft division into its airbus commercial airliner operation , and named a spanish aeronautical engineer domingo urena-raso to head the separate airbus military unit .
on monday , the german defense ministry confirmed its order for the a400m transporter after a news report had suggested the contract would be cancelled .
besides germany , france and ten other nations have ordered the turbo-prop military plane , which resembles its us counterpart the lockheed martin c-130 hercules .
in berlin , a defense ministry spokesman said that in spite of production delays , germany needed the 60 planes on order , explaining that it was the final delivery date , rather than the test-flight date that mattered .

" the objective is to help reliable customers abroad to solve their financing problems , thus securing exports of our planes , " peter hintze the german government 's aerospace co-ordinator told dpa news agency .
paris is also launching a similar program to encourage sales of airbus jets . eads is a european consortium dominated by german and french shareholder interests .
the french business daily les echos said that five billion euros in credit from the french government would help cash-strapped airlines honor their commitments to airbus orders as well as other eads products . more than 40 percent of eads stock is publicly traded on several european stock exchanges . unlike many companies that cut dividends to shareholders because of the economic slump , eads said it would pay 20 cents per share for 2008 , up from 12 cents the previous year . df / sp / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we made significant headway in reshaping the company , " louis gallois , chief executive of eads said .
although 2009 would be " challenging " due to an expected overall slump in aircraft orders amid the global economic recession , gallois said that " 2009 deliveries should remain at high levels . "
better results than forecast last year airbus delivered a record 483 aircraft , surpassing its chief competitor , the us-based boeing .
eads said cost cutting measures at its airbus division was largely responsible for its robust profits . the net profits also turned out to be better than expected .
industry analysts polled by dow jones newswires , had forecast a net profit of only 1.3 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads military aircraft will be integrated into its airbus division in addition to airbus passenger jets , eads also manufactures military aircraft , rockets , satellites and defense communications systems .
setback in eads military division the company admitted that its new a400m military transport aircraft has been beset with technical problems , forcing it to delay its first flight .
but gallois remained optimistic about the company 's prospects .
" even if the a400m program required enormous attention , the group has regained stability in 2008 and is proving to be resilient in the face of the turbulent global economic environment , " he said .
last month , eads announced it would integrate the military transport aircraft division into its airbus commercial airliner operation , and named a spanish aeronautical engineer domingo urena-raso to head the separate airbus military unit .
on monday , the german defense ministry confirmed its order for the a400m transporter after a news report had suggested the contract would be cancelled .
besides germany , france and ten other nations have ordered the turbo-prop military plane , which resembles its us counterpart the lockheed martin c-130 hercules .
in berlin , a defense ministry spokesman said that in spite of production delays , germany needed the 60 planes on order , explaining that it was the final delivery date , rather than the test-flight date that mattered .
altogether eads has 192 a400m transporters worth 20 billion euros on order .
berlin , paris offer credit lines to aircraft buyers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin and paris have pledged financial support for eads the german government also joined france on tuesday in helping buyers of commercial airbus jets by offering credit lines amid fears international banks might restrict lending .
germany 's federal bank kfw and its export credit guarantees agency hermes will permit customers to continue buying airbus aircraft .
" the objective is to help reliable customers abroad to solve their financing problems , thus securing exports of our planes , " peter hintze the german government 's aerospace co-ordinator told dpa news agency .
paris is also launching a similar program to encourage sales of airbus jets . eads is a european consortium dominated by german and french shareholder interests .
the french business daily les echos said that five billion euros in credit from the french government would help cash-strapped airlines honor their commitments to airbus orders as well as other eads products . more than 40 percent of eads stock is publicly traded on several european stock exchanges . unlike many companies that cut dividends to shareholders because of the economic slump , eads said it would pay 20 cents per share for 2008 , up from 12 cents the previous year . df / sp / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's the question for the european central bank , which is pondering further cuts in interest rates .
but experts disagree on the benefits of bottoming out rates to stimulate growth . with the ecb 's prime lending rate currently at a record low of 1.5 percent , getting euros has never been so cheap .
but a host of leading bankers have said the rate will have to fall even further if the ecb wants to fight the effects of global economic and financial crisis . indeed , one member of the ecb 's executive board has broken a long-standing taboo and talking about the possibility of a 0 percent interest rate . " if the economic situation worsens , the ecb is ready for further interest rate cuts - even down to zero , " board member lorenzo bini smaghi told the german financial newspaper boersen-zeitung on tuesday , march 10 . smaghi stressed that such an option would only come in for consideration if the euro-zone economy was hit by deflation .
but the mere fact that he mentioned it as a possibility signals how nervous europe 's leading bankers are these days about the prospects for economic recovery . broad consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet has denied that zero is an option , but other experts say it might be still , interest rates are unlikely to hit rock-bottom in the immediate future .
the head of the ecb , jean-claude trichet , has said in the past that a 0 percent interest rate is not on the agenda , and the head of germany 's national bank , axel weber , was quick to reject the option . " i see 1 percent as the lower limit to which the primary refinancing rate can fall , " bundesbank president weber said at a press conference on tuesday . but weber , who is also an ecb director , seemed to indicate that he would support further , smaller cuts in the prime lending rate , as did his ecb colleague juergen stark . " of course , there 's still certain room for monetary-policy maneuvering , " stark , who is responsible for the ecb 's economic and monetary analysis , told reuters news agency on monday . the us federal reserve and the bank of japan has effectively set their main rates at zero . creativity needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb says it 's looking for other ways to boast the economy but at the same time as the experts were suggesting further cuts in rates , they also cautioned against seeing such a strategy as a cure-all for the euro zone 's economic woes . " it wo n't be able to fundamentally solve the problems caused by the financial crisis , " stark said , adding that interest rates that were too low could actually worsen the euro zone 's current difficulties . the european central bank is also looking to explore other avenues to stimulate the bloc 's economy . " we will continue to consult about how - above and beyond interest-rate cuts - we can provide monetary-policy impulses , " weber said . it 's unclear what those alternative measures could be , but they will not include buying government bonds .
the experts reject that idea , which has been used , for example , in england , as being contrary to the spirit of fair competition with the euro zone . jc / sms / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the deteriorating situation in the region poses a security threat not just to the united states but to every single nation round this table , " biden told representatives of the 26-nation military alliance during a visit to brussels on tuesday , march 10 .

" it was from the very same mountains that the attacks of 9/11 were planned , " he said , adding that nato should seek " pragmatic solutions " to its war in afghanistan . biden said options included direct talks with moderate factions of the taliban , most of whom are only involved in the insurgency for the money . " we are not now winning the war , but the war is far from lost , " biden told a news conference after three hours of talks . afghan president hamid karzai said his government had long supported dialogue with those members of the taliban , who are not connected with " terrorists .

we are very like-minded in many multi-lateral issues , so we share a lot of views in the un and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa is hosting the world cup in 2010 of course , with germany having hosted the fifa world cup , we 're also making use of their experience for our own 2010 world cup and germany has been sharing its experiences with us . foreign minister steinmeier has started many initiatives concerning africa , and there has really been an emphasis placed on african policy here in germany .
have you noticed this ? yes , we have noticed this growing interest and have been working very closely with germany .
in some instances , we work together in a third country in africa to strengthen peace and in programs of reconstruction , like in southern sudan and the democratic republic of congo .
we are very happy that germany is taking this particular interest because africa does need this support and also germany has been very supportive to the african union itself . the current economic crisis is challenging not only the african countries , but also the united states and european countries .
what are you expecting the g20 to do ? i think the g20 should reflect on the fact that africa will be very hard hit by this economic depression .
as they look at packages to salvage their own economies , g20 countries must be thinking about the economies of developing countries , particularly in africa .
also , regarding the millennium development goals , which were already a big challenge , if western countries do not continue giving development aid , those may be undermined and africa may be left out in terms of reaching those goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's development agency gtz is supporting a solar cooker project in south africa we also think that this is an opportunity for the transformation and reform of the bretton woods institutions -lrb- eds. note : the bretton woods system established the international bank for reconstruction and development and the international monetary fund -rrb- .

if we look at alternative sources of energy , this may be an area of growth that countries like germany and others could invest in in developing countries .
there may be opportunities that we should be able to jointly explore that come from this unfortunate economic depression . you mention the reform of the bretton woods institutions .
do you think africa should have more voice in those institutions ? yes , i think so .
i think that developing countries , particularly in africa , should have a greater voice .
i think there 's a whole range of issues that would need to be looked at if we look at reforming the bretton woods institutions . the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- announced a warrant of arrest against sudanese president omar al-bashir last week .
south africa and others in africa said they regretted the court 's decision because of the indictment 's timing and because the warrant targets a sitting president .
in what way is this icc decision problematic to you ? if you look at sudan , particularly darfur , the african union has been grappling with that situation to try and find a peaceful settlement of that conflict .
of course , the sudanese government is crucial in the finding of that peaceful settlement .
at this point in time , when we are busy with that , there 's an indictment of a sitting president .
it does create problems because it may undermine the peace efforts . what are important for us are the millions of lives of those people in darfur - that they can get peace and begin rebuilding their lives .
we thought that this was really the wrong time and we tried to say , let the court defer it , even for a year .

that 's after the bundesbank - the country 's national bank - posted 6.3 billion euros in profits for last year .
but falling interest rates could bring a downturn . bundesbank president axel weber announced the rise in profits at a news conference in frankfurt am main on tuesday , march 10 . the bank , he said , had earned the equivalent of $ 8 billion in 2008 - an increase of around 50 percent over the previous year . " despite the hefty increase in reserves , the bundesbank 's profits are markedly higher , " weber said . the entire sum earned is being transferred to the federal government - which is something of a novelty .
in previous years , portions of the bundesbank 's earnings have had to be used to pay off debt from the former east germany , but now that the debt is gone , the bank 's profits will flow into state coffers . the additional 6.3 billion euros will come as very welcome news to chancellor angela merkel 's government , which is looking for every spare euro it can find after agreeing to engage in deficit spending in an attempt to combat the effects of the global financial and economic crisis . the government has already promised billions in bail-outs to the banking industry and said it would consider loan guarantees and other rescue measures to other industries . prime rate key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesbank president weber had good news and bad news weber said most of the bank 's profits had been earned from lending money to banks .

" because of declining demands for experts , the german economy is especially affected , " he said , referring to the economic crisis . weber said he expected the 2009 inflation rate in germany to be 0 percent - a figure that gives rise to fears of deflation and worries that the recession could turn into a full-scale economic depression . but weber said he did not think deflation was a serious danger . jc / sms / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a major oil transit route , somalia 's coast is prone to pirate attacks . germany turned over nine pirates , arrested for attacking a merchant vessel in the gulf of aden off the somali coast last week , to kenya on tuesday , march 10 . the german navy frigate rheinland pfalz had seized the alleged pirates when they used bazookas and firearms to attack a german-owned merchant vessel .

that 's the question for the european central bank , which is pondering further cuts in interest rates .
but experts disagree on the benefits of bottoming out rates to stimulate growth . with the ecb 's prime lending rate currently at a record low of 1.5 percent , getting euros has never been so cheap .
but a host of leading bankers have said the rate will have to fall even further if the ecb wants to fight the effects of global economic and financial crisis . indeed , one member of the ecb 's executive board has broken a long-standing taboo and talking about the possibility of a 0 percent interest rate . " if the economic situation worsens , the ecb is ready for further interest rate cuts - even down to zero , " board member lorenzo bini smaghi told the german financial newspaper boersen-zeitung on tuesday , march 10 . smaghi stressed that such an option would only come in for consideration if the euro-zone economy was hit by deflation .
but the mere fact that he mentioned it as a possibility signals how nervous europe 's leading bankers are these days about the prospects for economic recovery . broad consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet has denied that zero is an option , but other experts say it might be still , interest rates are unlikely to hit rock-bottom in the immediate future .
the head of the ecb , jean-claude trichet , has said in the past that a 0 percent interest rate is not on the agenda , and the head of germany 's national bank , axel weber , was quick to reject the option . " i see 1 percent as the lower limit to which the primary refinancing rate can fall , " bundesbank president weber said at a press conference on tuesday . but weber , who is also an ecb director , seemed to indicate that he would support further , smaller cuts in the prime lending rate , as did his ecb colleague juergen stark . " of course , there 's still certain room for monetary-policy maneuvering , " stark , who is responsible for the ecb 's economic and monetary analysis , told reuters news agency on monday . the us federal reserve and the bank of japan has effectively set their main rates at zero . creativity needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb says it 's looking for other ways to boast the economy but at the same time as the experts were suggesting further cuts in rates , they also cautioned against seeing such a strategy as a cure-all for the euro zone 's economic woes . " it wo n't be able to fundamentally solve the problems caused by the financial crisis , " stark said , adding that interest rates that were too low could actually worsen the euro zone 's current difficulties . the european central bank is also looking to explore other avenues to stimulate the bloc 's economy . " we will continue to consult about how - above and beyond interest-rate cuts - we can provide monetary-policy impulses , " weber said . it 's unclear what those alternative measures could be , but they will not include buying government bonds .
the experts reject that idea , which has been used , for example , in england , as being contrary to the spirit of fair competition with the euro zone . jc / sms / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts disagree on the benefits of bottoming out rates to stimulate growth . with the ecb 's prime lending rate currently at a record low of 1.5 percent , getting euros has never been so cheap .
but a host of leading bankers have said the rate will have to fall even further if the ecb wants to fight the effects of global economic and financial crisis . indeed , one member of the ecb 's executive board has broken a long-standing taboo and talking about the possibility of a 0 percent interest rate . " if the economic situation worsens , the ecb is ready for further interest rate cuts - even down to zero , " board member lorenzo bini smaghi told the german financial newspaper boersen-zeitung on tuesday , march 10 . smaghi stressed that such an option would only come in for consideration if the euro-zone economy was hit by deflation .
but the mere fact that he mentioned it as a possibility signals how nervous europe 's leading bankers are these days about the prospects for economic recovery . broad consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet has denied that zero is an option , but other experts say it might be still , interest rates are unlikely to hit rock-bottom in the immediate future .
the head of the ecb , jean-claude trichet , has said in the past that a 0 percent interest rate is not on the agenda , and the head of germany 's national bank , axel weber , was quick to reject the option .

" of course , there 's still certain room for monetary-policy maneuvering , " stark , who is responsible for the ecb 's economic and monetary analysis , told reuters news agency on monday . the us federal reserve and the bank of japan has effectively set their main rates at zero . creativity needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb says it 's looking for other ways to boast the economy but at the same time as the experts were suggesting further cuts in rates , they also cautioned against seeing such a strategy as a cure-all for the euro zone 's economic woes . " it wo n't be able to fundamentally solve the problems caused by the financial crisis , " stark said , adding that interest rates that were too low could actually worsen the euro zone 's current difficulties . the european central bank is also looking to explore other avenues to stimulate the bloc 's economy . " we will continue to consult about how - above and beyond interest-rate cuts - we can provide monetary-policy impulses , " weber said . it 's unclear what those alternative measures could be , but they will not include buying government bonds .

" the deteriorating situation in the region poses a security threat not just to the united states but to every single nation round this table , " biden told representatives of the 26-nation military alliance during a visit to brussels on tuesday , march 10 . " it was from the very same mountains that the attacks of 9/11 were planned , " he said , adding that nato should seek " pragmatic solutions " to its war in afghanistan . biden said options included direct talks with moderate factions of the taliban , most of whom are only involved in the insurgency for the money . " we are not now winning the war , but the war is far from lost , " biden told a news conference after three hours of talks . afghan president hamid karzai said his government had long supported dialogue with those members of the taliban , who are not connected with " terrorists . " election security boost needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security has worsened in afghanistan as the taliban regroups nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called on nato to boost efforts before afghan elections due in august . " it is important that this alliance delivers in the short-term , " scheffer told reporters , saying that the meeting with biden had been " very productive . " biden 's visit comes as us president barack obama pushes for a fresh strategy to fight the insurgency in afghanistan with more international support .
the us vice president stressed that the purpose of his trip was to listen to washington 's european allies . " when we consult , we get the type of consensus that our political leadership needs , " biden said .
" absent that kind of cohesion , it will be incredibly more difficult to meet the common threats we are going to face . " biden will be meeting with senior european union officials at eu headquarters in brussels later on tuesday . biden looking for concrete help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has boosted the number of troops in afghanistan the visit of obama 's second in command comes less than a week after a trip by us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton , who attended a nato foreign ministers ' meeting last thursday and met the european union 's foreign policy heads on friday . " this is not just lip service , the idea of consultation , we mean it , and in return we want concrete ideas and concrete assistance , " a senior obama administration official told afp news agency on condition of anonymity . violence in afghanistan was at its worst level in 2008 since the ouster of the taliban regime seven years ago . obama is reviewing how nato 's mission in afghanistan can turn the tide in the volatile south of the country , which has seen a steady rise in fighting and losses for us and allied countries . obama has ordered an interagency review to examine us policy on afghanistan and pakistan before a nato summit in april .
former cia official bruce riedel , now a senior fellow at the brookings institution think tank in washington , is heading the review . in addition to vowing to end us combat operations in iraq by august 2010 , he has also ordered the deployment of 17,000 troops to afghanistan , saying they were needed to stabilize a deteriorating security situation . call for more troops will fall on deaf ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is one of the nations under pressure to send more troops to afghanistan european allies expect the us to demand more troops for the war in afghanistan , and urge allies to remove restrictions on where their soldiers can fight . but some major nato partners have made clear that they are not in a position to send more soldiers into afghanistan , so top us officials have recently been stressing the need to boost political and development components of the afghan mission . " the united states recognizes that not all of our allies can contribute troops but we appreciate other forms of assistance equally , " the senior official , quoted by afp , said . " if you do n't like us policies , and obviously that 's been an issue in the past , we will want your concrete ideas about what we should be doing in afghanistan , and not just criticism , " the official said . df / sac / sms / sp / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are ways of honoring someone you admire , and then there are simply poor ideas .
two german discount food retailers have hit upon the latter by naming their new fried chicken product " obama fingers . " " haehnchenstueckchen paniert nach suedstaatenart " ... that 's the clumsy german translation for " southern fried chicken , " and two supermarket discounters have displayed a likewise maladroit understanding of american culture in bringing out a new frozen food delicacy . apparently unaware of the historically racist stereotypes connected this particular food item in the united states , the plus and netto food retailers have chosen to pay homage to everybody 's favorite leader of the free world by using his name for 500-gram packages of ready-to-be-reheated bird parts . the packaging features a picture of something remotely resembling the golden gate bridge - the statue of liberty was presumably unavailable for the photo shoot - and is part of a seven-day trial " america week " the supermarkets are conducting . bizarrely , the chicken snacks also come with curry sauce - not exactly a typical condiment south of the mason-dixon line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's he going to use now to make a point ?
a spokesperson for the manufacturer told ap news agency the company hoped to cash on obama 's charisma and boost sales on the back of the president 's popularity . admirable honesty , but charisma - as history teaches us - tends not to be transferrable to things that are hacked apart , stuffed inside a cardboard box and deep frozen . the fingers will probably be off the shelves by april 3 , when their namesake is scheduled to visit german chancellor angela merkel . but if they 're not , the chancellor should be wary causing utter befuddlement and potential offense to her guest - and simply serve him up some good old german sausage . jc / sms / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 're not planning on any additional measures , " steinbrueck told journalists as he arrived for a meeting with his eurozone counterparts in brussels on monday , march 9 .
" we should concentrate on measures that have already been decided . "
german lawmakers this year passed an stimulus package worth 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 63 billion -rrb- to haul europe 's largest economy out of its worst recession in decades .
it includes investments in infrastructure , tax relief , reductions in health care contributions and money for families with children .
it also provides 2,500-euro bonuses to people who junk old cars to buy new vehicles .
the package follows an earlier 23 billion-euro plan , criticized in germany and abroad as too cautious .
lawrence summers , a top economics advisor to us president barack obama , this week urged governments worldwide to pump more public money into their economies to revive falling global demand .
" no rift " with europe on tackling crisis the white house has been trying in recent days to steer clear of an out-and-out confrontation with europe over how to best handle a deep global recession .
while the united states would like to see more stimulus plans , europe has insisted on more financial regulations .
but white house spokesman robert gibbs said on monday president obama believes that regulation is needed to prevent a repeat of the present crisis in the future , and stimulus is required to get the economy moving now . " so i do n't think there 's any rift -lrb- with europe -rrb- at all , " gibbs told reporters .
world leaders are counting on a group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit in london next month to come up with global solutions for dealing with the financial crisis .
the us will use the london meeting to discuss " a number of subjects , both financial regulation and economic stimulus , largely because there is n't one single solution to those problems , " gibbs said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us would like to see more stimulus measures in europe the united states has a stimulus plan of nearly $ 790 billion -lrb- 626 billion euros -rrb- which it hopes will drag it out of what has shaped up to be the deepest recession in decades .
in the european union , countries have agreed to stimulus measures worth about 400 billion euros , the equivalent of 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic process , according to afp news agency .
europe wo n't see much improvement in 2009 economic recovery for the 16 countries which share the euro will not happen this year , eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said monday .
previous forecasts had predicted that the economies would pick up in late 2009 .
" the recovery will take longer than we were expecting only a few months ago , " almunia told journalists after a meeting with euro zone finance ministers in brussels .
the european commission forecast in january that the euro zone would contract 1.9 percent for the whole of 2009 before growing a measly 0.5 percent in 2010 .
" we 'll present a new forecast in may but taking into account the downside risks that have appeared and started to materialize after we presented the january forecasts , i tend to think that this scenario or gradual recovery will be -lrb- postponed -rrb- to 2010 , " almunia said . th / sp / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's the question for the european central bank , which is pondering further cuts in interest rates .
but experts disagree on the benefits of bottoming out rates to stimulate growth . with the ecb 's prime lending rate currently at a record low of 1.5 percent , getting euros has never been so cheap .
but a host of leading bankers have said the rate will have to fall even further if the ecb wants to fight the effects of global economic and financial crisis . indeed , one member of the ecb 's executive board has broken a long-standing taboo and talking about the possibility of a 0 percent interest rate . " if the economic situation worsens , the ecb is ready for further interest rate cuts - even down to zero , " board member lorenzo bini smaghi told the german financial newspaper boersen-zeitung on tuesday , march 10 . smaghi stressed that such an option would only come in for consideration if the euro-zone economy was hit by deflation .

" it wo n't be able to fundamentally solve the problems caused by the financial crisis , " stark said , adding that interest rates that were too low could actually worsen the euro zone 's current difficulties . the european central bank is also looking to explore other avenues to stimulate the bloc 's economy . " we will continue to consult about how - above and beyond interest-rate cuts - we can provide monetary-policy impulses , " weber said . it 's unclear what those alternative measures could be , but they will not include buying government bonds .

two german discount food retailers have hit upon the latter by naming their new fried chicken product " obama fingers . " " haehnchenstueckchen paniert nach suedstaatenart " ... that 's the clumsy german translation for " southern fried chicken , " and two supermarket discounters have displayed a likewise maladroit understanding of american culture in bringing out a new frozen food delicacy . apparently unaware of the historically racist stereotypes connected this particular food item in the united states , the plus and netto food retailers have chosen to pay homage to everybody 's favorite leader of the free world by using his name for 500-gram packages of ready-to-be-reheated bird parts . the packaging features a picture of something remotely resembling the golden gate bridge - the statue of liberty was presumably unavailable for the photo shoot - and is part of a seven-day trial " america week " the supermarkets are conducting . bizarrely , the chicken snacks also come with curry sauce - not exactly a typical condiment south of the mason-dixon line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's he going to use now to make a point ?
a spokesperson for the manufacturer told ap news agency the company hoped to cash on obama 's charisma and boost sales on the back of the president 's popularity . admirable honesty , but charisma - as history teaches us - tends not to be transferrable to things that are hacked apart , stuffed inside a cardboard box and deep frozen . the fingers will probably be off the shelves by april 3 , when their namesake is scheduled to visit german chancellor angela merkel . but if they 're not , the chancellor should be wary causing utter befuddlement and potential offense to her guest - and simply serve him up some good old german sausage . jc / sms / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's after the bundesbank - the country 's national bank - posted 6.3 billion euros in profits for last year .
but falling interest rates could bring a downturn . bundesbank president axel weber announced the rise in profits at a news conference in frankfurt am main on tuesday , march 10 . the bank , he said , had earned the equivalent of $ 8 billion in 2008 - an increase of around 50 percent over the previous year . " despite the hefty increase in reserves , the bundesbank 's profits are markedly higher , " weber said . the entire sum earned is being transferred to the federal government - which is something of a novelty .
in previous years , portions of the bundesbank 's earnings have had to be used to pay off debt from the former east germany , but now that the debt is gone , the bank 's profits will flow into state coffers . the additional 6.3 billion euros will come as very welcome news to chancellor angela merkel 's government , which is looking for every spare euro it can find after agreeing to engage in deficit spending in an attempt to combat the effects of the global financial and economic crisis . the government has already promised billions in bail-outs to the banking industry and said it would consider loan guarantees and other rescue measures to other industries . prime rate key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesbank president weber had good news and bad news weber said most of the bank 's profits had been earned from lending money to banks . " the increase is above all due to profits on interest in euros , " weber explained at the press conference , adding that the increased value of the bank 's assets in us dollars and its gold reserves had also contributed to the positive figures . but that news is also cause for concern due to the current downward trend in european interest rates . the european central bank 's prime lending rate prior to the outbreak of the financial crisis in the second half of 2008 stood at 4.25 percent . the ecb has since slashed it to a mere 1.5 percent , and many commentators are saying further rate decreases , perhaps all the way down to zero , may be necessary . such a step could dramatically reduce the bundesbank 's profits for 2009 . no dancing in the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank probably ca n't expect the same results for 2009 despite the good coming his own institution , weber himself painted a gloomy picture of the economic future - both globally and for germany in particular . " because of declining demands for experts , the german economy is especially affected , " he said , referring to the economic crisis . weber said he expected the 2009 inflation rate in germany to be 0 percent - a figure that gives rise to fears of deflation and worries that the recession could turn into a full-scale economic depression . but weber said he did not think deflation was a serious danger . jc / sms / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.03.2009 germany 's bundesbank posts huge profits for 2008 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank profits are a windfall for the government there 's a check in the mail for the german government .
that 's after the bundesbank - the country 's national bank - posted 6.3 billion euros in profits for last year .
but falling interest rates could bring a downturn . bundesbank president axel weber announced the rise in profits at a news conference in frankfurt am main on tuesday , march 10 . the bank , he said , had earned the equivalent of $ 8 billion in 2008 - an increase of around 50 percent over the previous year . " despite the hefty increase in reserves , the bundesbank 's profits are markedly higher , " weber said . the entire sum earned is being transferred to the federal government - which is something of a novelty .
in previous years , portions of the bundesbank 's earnings have had to be used to pay off debt from the former east germany , but now that the debt is gone , the bank 's profits will flow into state coffers . the additional 6.3 billion euros will come as very welcome news to chancellor angela merkel 's government , which is looking for every spare euro it can find after agreeing to engage in deficit spending in an attempt to combat the effects of the global financial and economic crisis . the government has already promised billions in bail-outs to the banking industry and said it would consider loan guarantees and other rescue measures to other industries . prime rate key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesbank president weber had good news and bad news weber said most of the bank 's profits had been earned from lending money to banks . " the increase is above all due to profits on interest in euros , " weber explained at the press conference , adding that the increased value of the bank 's assets in us dollars and its gold reserves had also contributed to the positive figures . but that news is also cause for concern due to the current downward trend in european interest rates . the european central bank 's prime lending rate prior to the outbreak of the financial crisis in the second half of 2008 stood at 4.25 percent . the ecb has since slashed it to a mere 1.5 percent , and many commentators are saying further rate decreases , perhaps all the way down to zero , may be necessary . such a step could dramatically reduce the bundesbank 's profits for 2009 . no dancing in the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank probably ca n't expect the same results for 2009 despite the good coming his own institution , weber himself painted a gloomy picture of the economic future - both globally and for germany in particular . " because of declining demands for experts , the german economy is especially affected , " he said , referring to the economic crisis . weber said he expected the 2009 inflation rate in germany to be 0 percent - a figure that gives rise to fears of deflation and worries that the recession could turn into a full-scale economic depression . but weber said he did not think deflation was a serious danger . jc / sms / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the deteriorating situation in the region poses a security threat not just to the united states but to every single nation round this table , " biden told representatives of the 26-nation military alliance during a visit to brussels on tuesday , march 10 . " it was from the very same mountains that the attacks of 9/11 were planned , " he said , adding that nato should seek " pragmatic solutions " to its war in afghanistan . biden said options included direct talks with moderate factions of the taliban , most of whom are only involved in the insurgency for the money . " we are not now winning the war , but the war is far from lost , " biden told a news conference after three hours of talks . afghan president hamid karzai said his government had long supported dialogue with those members of the taliban , who are not connected with " terrorists .

the us vice president stressed that the purpose of his trip was to listen to washington 's european allies . " when we consult , we get the type of consensus that our political leadership needs , " biden said .

" this is not just lip service , the idea of consultation , we mean it , and in return we want concrete ideas and concrete assistance , " a senior obama administration official told afp news agency on condition of anonymity . violence in afghanistan was at its worst level in 2008 since the ouster of the taliban regime seven years ago . obama is reviewing how nato 's mission in afghanistan can turn the tide in the volatile south of the country , which has seen a steady rise in fighting and losses for us and allied countries . obama has ordered an interagency review to examine us policy on afghanistan and pakistan before a nato summit in april .
former cia official bruce riedel , now a senior fellow at the brookings institution think tank in washington , is heading the review . in addition to vowing to end us combat operations in iraq by august 2010 , he has also ordered the deployment of 17,000 troops to afghanistan , saying they were needed to stabilize a deteriorating security situation . call for more troops will fall on deaf ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is one of the nations under pressure to send more troops to afghanistan european allies expect the us to demand more troops for the war in afghanistan , and urge allies to remove restrictions on where their soldiers can fight . but some major nato partners have made clear that they are not in a position to send more soldiers into afghanistan , so top us officials have recently been stressing the need to boost political and development components of the afghan mission .

but she said the g20 needs to include african nations more in the debate on financial reforms . nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma has been south africa 's minister of foreign affairs since 1999 .
she met with her german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier in berlin on monday , march 9 , as part of a four-nation european tour aimed at consolidating bilateral political , economic and trade relations between south africa and european countries . deutsche welle : what are the main common interests between germany and south africa ? nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma : we 're here at the invitation of the foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to strengthen our bilateral relations , which are already good .
but we want to be sure they remain so and grow : in economic cooperation , trade , science and technology and many other areas .
we are very like-minded in many multi-lateral issues , so we share a lot of views in the un and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa is hosting the world cup in 2010 of course , with germany having hosted the fifa world cup , we 're also making use of their experience for our own 2010 world cup and germany has been sharing its experiences with us . foreign minister steinmeier has started many initiatives concerning africa , and there has really been an emphasis placed on african policy here in germany .
have you noticed this ? yes , we have noticed this growing interest and have been working very closely with germany .
in some instances , we work together in a third country in africa to strengthen peace and in programs of reconstruction , like in southern sudan and the democratic republic of congo .
we are very happy that germany is taking this particular interest because africa does need this support and also germany has been very supportive to the african union itself . the current economic crisis is challenging not only the african countries , but also the united states and european countries .
what are you expecting the g20 to do ? i think the g20 should reflect on the fact that africa will be very hard hit by this economic depression .
as they look at packages to salvage their own economies , g20 countries must be thinking about the economies of developing countries , particularly in africa .
also , regarding the millennium development goals , which were already a big challenge , if western countries do not continue giving development aid , those may be undermined and africa may be left out in terms of reaching those goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's development agency gtz is supporting a solar cooker project in south africa we also think that this is an opportunity for the transformation and reform of the bretton woods institutions -lrb- eds. note : the bretton woods system established the international bank for reconstruction and development and the international monetary fund -rrb- .
but we think that needs a broader discussion , not just within the g20 . we also think we need to look at opportunities that may arise from this depression .
if we look at alternative sources of energy , this may be an area of growth that countries like germany and others could invest in in developing countries .
there may be opportunities that we should be able to jointly explore that come from this unfortunate economic depression . you mention the reform of the bretton woods institutions .
do you think africa should have more voice in those institutions ? yes , i think so .
i think that developing countries , particularly in africa , should have a greater voice .
i think there 's a whole range of issues that would need to be looked at if we look at reforming the bretton woods institutions . the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- announced a warrant of arrest against sudanese president omar al-bashir last week .
south africa and others in africa said they regretted the court 's decision because of the indictment 's timing and because the warrant targets a sitting president .
in what way is this icc decision problematic to you ? if you look at sudan , particularly darfur , the african union has been grappling with that situation to try and find a peaceful settlement of that conflict .
of course , the sudanese government is crucial in the finding of that peaceful settlement .
at this point in time , when we are busy with that , there 's an indictment of a sitting president .
it does create problems because it may undermine the peace efforts . what are important for us are the millions of lives of those people in darfur - that they can get peace and begin rebuilding their lives .
we thought that this was really the wrong time and we tried to say , let the court defer it , even for a year .
it is provided for in the rome statutes -lrb- eds. note : the treaty that established the icc -rrb- .
we thought if this was deferred for a year - and to just give peace a chance - that would have been better . do you think the icc decision could provoke a new confrontation between international institutions like the icc and africa ? we just think it 's a pity that they took this decision at this point in time , which is undermining the work that the african union is trying to do . ute schaeffer interviewed nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but she said the g20 needs to include african nations more in the debate on financial reforms . nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma has been south africa 's minister of foreign affairs since 1999 .
she met with her german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier in berlin on monday , march 9 , as part of a four-nation european tour aimed at consolidating bilateral political , economic and trade relations between south africa and european countries . deutsche welle : what are the main common interests between germany and south africa ? nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma : we 're here at the invitation of the foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to strengthen our bilateral relations , which are already good .
but we want to be sure they remain so and grow : in economic cooperation , trade , science and technology and many other areas .
we are very like-minded in many multi-lateral issues , so we share a lot of views in the un and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa is hosting the world cup in 2010 of course , with germany having hosted the fifa world cup , we 're also making use of their experience for our own 2010 world cup and germany has been sharing its experiences with us . foreign minister steinmeier has started many initiatives concerning africa , and there has really been an emphasis placed on african policy here in germany .
have you noticed this ? yes , we have noticed this growing interest and have been working very closely with germany .
in some instances , we work together in a third country in africa to strengthen peace and in programs of reconstruction , like in southern sudan and the democratic republic of congo .
we are very happy that germany is taking this particular interest because africa does need this support and also germany has been very supportive to the african union itself . the current economic crisis is challenging not only the african countries , but also the united states and european countries .

but she said the g20 needs to include african nations more in the debate on financial reforms . nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma has been south africa 's minister of foreign affairs since 1999 .
she met with her german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier in berlin on monday , march 9 , as part of a four-nation european tour aimed at consolidating bilateral political , economic and trade relations between south africa and european countries . deutsche welle : what are the main common interests between germany and south africa ? nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma : we 're here at the invitation of the foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to strengthen our bilateral relations , which are already good .
but we want to be sure they remain so and grow : in economic cooperation , trade , science and technology and many other areas .
we are very like-minded in many multi-lateral issues , so we share a lot of views in the un and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa is hosting the world cup in 2010 of course , with germany having hosted the fifa world cup , we 're also making use of their experience for our own 2010 world cup and germany has been sharing its experiences with us . foreign minister steinmeier has started many initiatives concerning africa , and there has really been an emphasis placed on african policy here in germany .
have you noticed this ? yes , we have noticed this growing interest and have been working very closely with germany .
in some instances , we work together in a third country in africa to strengthen peace and in programs of reconstruction , like in southern sudan and the democratic republic of congo .
we are very happy that germany is taking this particular interest because africa does need this support and also germany has been very supportive to the african union itself . the current economic crisis is challenging not only the african countries , but also the united states and european countries .
what are you expecting the g20 to do ? i think the g20 should reflect on the fact that africa will be very hard hit by this economic depression .
as they look at packages to salvage their own economies , g20 countries must be thinking about the economies of developing countries , particularly in africa .

it 's the first appearance of the h5n1 strain in the eu this year . the outbreak " was found in a wild duck shot during a hunt near the town of starnberg in the german state of bavaria , " the european union 's executive arm said in a statement on tuesday , march 10 .
the commission said that germany , which has carried out " protection measures " to ensure the virus is not spread , would not be forced to quarantine the area around where the bird was found or monitor the region .
" on basis of the favorable result of a risk assessment , germany may refrain from the establishment of a control area and a surrounding monitoring area around a positive finding , " the statement said .
" this derogation has been used taking into account that the hunt had already taken place in january . "
though bird flu is difficult for people to catch , the h5n1 strain has killed at least 250 people worldwide .
the last wild-bird case of bird flu in the 27-nation bloc was found in a canadian goose in britain in february last year , while the last outbreak in poultry of h5n1 in the eu was detected last october in the german state of saxony . sms / jc / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are ways of honoring someone you admire , and then there are simply poor ideas .
two german discount food retailers have hit upon the latter by naming their new fried chicken product " obama fingers . " " haehnchenstueckchen paniert nach suedstaatenart " ... that 's the clumsy german translation for " southern fried chicken , " and two supermarket discounters have displayed a likewise maladroit understanding of american culture in bringing out a new frozen food delicacy . apparently unaware of the historically racist stereotypes connected this particular food item in the united states , the plus and netto food retailers have chosen to pay homage to everybody 's favorite leader of the free world by using his name for 500-gram packages of ready-to-be-reheated bird parts . the packaging features a picture of something remotely resembling the golden gate bridge - the statue of liberty was presumably unavailable for the photo shoot - and is part of a seven-day trial " america week " the supermarkets are conducting . bizarrely , the chicken snacks also come with curry sauce - not exactly a typical condiment south of the mason-dixon line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's he going to use now to make a point ?
a spokesperson for the manufacturer told ap news agency the company hoped to cash on obama 's charisma and boost sales on the back of the president 's popularity . admirable honesty , but charisma - as history teaches us - tends not to be transferrable to things that are hacked apart , stuffed inside a cardboard box and deep frozen . the fingers will probably be off the shelves by april 3 , when their namesake is scheduled to visit german chancellor angela merkel . but if they 're not , the chancellor should be wary causing utter befuddlement and potential offense to her guest - and simply serve him up some good old german sausage . jc / sms / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if the economic situation worsens , the ecb is ready for further interest rate cuts - even down to zero , " board member lorenzo bini smaghi told the german financial newspaper boersen-zeitung on tuesday , march 10 . smaghi stressed that such an option would only come in for consideration if the euro-zone economy was hit by deflation .

" the deteriorating situation in the region poses a security threat not just to the united states but to every single nation round this table , " biden told representatives of the 26-nation military alliance during a visit to brussels on tuesday , march 10 . " it was from the very same mountains that the attacks of 9/11 were planned , " he said , adding that nato should seek " pragmatic solutions " to its war in afghanistan . biden said options included direct talks with moderate factions of the taliban , most of whom are only involved in the insurgency for the money . " we are not now winning the war , but the war is far from lost , " biden told a news conference after three hours of talks . afghan president hamid karzai said his government had long supported dialogue with those members of the taliban , who are not connected with " terrorists . " election security boost needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security has worsened in afghanistan as the taliban regroups nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called on nato to boost efforts before afghan elections due in august . " it is important that this alliance delivers in the short-term , " scheffer told reporters , saying that the meeting with biden had been " very productive . " biden 's visit comes as us president barack obama pushes for a fresh strategy to fight the insurgency in afghanistan with more international support .
the us vice president stressed that the purpose of his trip was to listen to washington 's european allies . " when we consult , we get the type of consensus that our political leadership needs , " biden said .
" absent that kind of cohesion , it will be incredibly more difficult to meet the common threats we are going to face . " biden will be meeting with senior european union officials at eu headquarters in brussels later on tuesday . biden looking for concrete help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has boosted the number of troops in afghanistan the visit of obama 's second in command comes less than a week after a trip by us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton , who attended a nato foreign ministers ' meeting last thursday and met the european union 's foreign policy heads on friday . " this is not just lip service , the idea of consultation , we mean it , and in return we want concrete ideas and concrete assistance , " a senior obama administration official told afp news agency on condition of anonymity . violence in afghanistan was at its worst level in 2008 since the ouster of the taliban regime seven years ago . obama is reviewing how nato 's mission in afghanistan can turn the tide in the volatile south of the country , which has seen a steady rise in fighting and losses for us and allied countries . obama has ordered an interagency review to examine us policy on afghanistan and pakistan before a nato summit in april .

that 's the question for the european central bank , which is pondering further cuts in interest rates .
but experts disagree on the benefits of bottoming out rates to stimulate growth . with the ecb 's prime lending rate currently at a record low of 1.5 percent , getting euros has never been so cheap .
but a host of leading bankers have said the rate will have to fall even further if the ecb wants to fight the effects of global economic and financial crisis . indeed , one member of the ecb 's executive board has broken a long-standing taboo and talking about the possibility of a 0 percent interest rate . " if the economic situation worsens , the ecb is ready for further interest rate cuts - even down to zero , " board member lorenzo bini smaghi told the german financial newspaper boersen-zeitung on tuesday , march 10 . smaghi stressed that such an option would only come in for consideration if the euro-zone economy was hit by deflation .
but the mere fact that he mentioned it as a possibility signals how nervous europe 's leading bankers are these days about the prospects for economic recovery . broad consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet has denied that zero is an option , but other experts say it might be still , interest rates are unlikely to hit rock-bottom in the immediate future .
the head of the ecb , jean-claude trichet , has said in the past that a 0 percent interest rate is not on the agenda , and the head of germany 's national bank , axel weber , was quick to reject the option . " i see 1 percent as the lower limit to which the primary refinancing rate can fall , " bundesbank president weber said at a press conference on tuesday . but weber , who is also an ecb director , seemed to indicate that he would support further , smaller cuts in the prime lending rate , as did his ecb colleague juergen stark . " of course , there 's still certain room for monetary-policy maneuvering , " stark , who is responsible for the ecb 's economic and monetary analysis , told reuters news agency on monday . the us federal reserve and the bank of japan has effectively set their main rates at zero . creativity needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb says it 's looking for other ways to boast the economy but at the same time as the experts were suggesting further cuts in rates , they also cautioned against seeing such a strategy as a cure-all for the euro zone 's economic woes . " it wo n't be able to fundamentally solve the problems caused by the financial crisis , " stark said , adding that interest rates that were too low could actually worsen the euro zone 's current difficulties . the european central bank is also looking to explore other avenues to stimulate the bloc 's economy . " we will continue to consult about how - above and beyond interest-rate cuts - we can provide monetary-policy impulses , " weber said . it 's unclear what those alternative measures could be , but they will not include buying government bonds .

" the deteriorating situation in the region poses a security threat not just to the united states but to every single nation round this table , " biden told representatives of the 26-nation military alliance during a visit to brussels on tuesday , march 10 . " it was from the very same mountains that the attacks of 9/11 were planned , " he said , adding that nato should seek " pragmatic solutions " to its war in afghanistan . biden said options included direct talks with moderate factions of the taliban , most of whom are only involved in the insurgency for the money . " we are not now winning the war , but the war is far from lost , " biden told a news conference after three hours of talks . afghan president hamid karzai said his government had long supported dialogue with those members of the taliban , who are not connected with " terrorists .

former cia official bruce riedel , now a senior fellow at the brookings institution think tank in washington , is heading the review . in addition to vowing to end us combat operations in iraq by august 2010 , he has also ordered the deployment of 17,000 troops to afghanistan , saying they were needed to stabilize a deteriorating security situation . call for more troops will fall on deaf ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is one of the nations under pressure to send more troops to afghanistan european allies expect the us to demand more troops for the war in afghanistan , and urge allies to remove restrictions on where their soldiers can fight . but some major nato partners have made clear that they are not in a position to send more soldiers into afghanistan , so top us officials have recently been stressing the need to boost political and development components of the afghan mission .

" we 're not planning on any additional measures , " steinbrueck told journalists as he arrived for a meeting with his eurozone counterparts in brussels on monday , march 9 .
" we should concentrate on measures that have already been decided . "
german lawmakers this year passed an stimulus package worth 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 63 billion -rrb- to haul europe 's largest economy out of its worst recession in decades .
it includes investments in infrastructure , tax relief , reductions in health care contributions and money for families with children .

new data shows the country 's trade surplus for january was only half of the amount of a year ago . german exports dived 20.7 percent in january 2009 compared to a year ago , its biggest drop in the last 16 years . the world 's leading export nation exported 66.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 85 billion -rrb- worth of goods in january 2009 compared to 84 billion euros reported the previous year , according to preliminary figures released from the federal statistics office in wiesbaden on tuesday , march 10 . germany has been especially hard hit by the global recession , with a steep decline in its key export markets in europe and asia . " the growth engine of the german economy is out of fuel , " said ing economist carsten brzeski .
" any stabilization of the economy of the economy in 2007 will have to come from domestic demand , " he told the dpa news agency . sharper export decline in non-eu countries the decline marked germany 's fourth consecutive monthly drop in exports as europe 's largest economy faces its worst recession since the end of world war ii .
german exports to its partners in the euro zone fell by 18.7 percent from 2008 .
exports to non-eu countries plunged by 24.5 percent of 2008 levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's trade surplus dived to half in january from a year ago the sharp contraction in key industries such as engineering goods and the auto industry contributed significantly to the fall in exports . january 2009 imports also fell by 12.9 percent from 67 billion euros in 2008 to 58 billion euros .
the drop represents a 4.4 percent drop from december alone , making it the fourth consecutive monthly decline as well . commerzbank analyst simon junker told the afp news agency that " foreign trade is expected to have a sharp negative impact on growth again in the first quarter " of 2009 . german exports hard hit in eastern europe germany 's trade surplus was down to 8.5 billion euros , compared with double the amount - 17 billion euros - in january 2008 . a current account surplus , which is the broadest measure of trade activity that includes services and financial transfers , plunged more than three-fold to 4.2 billion euros from 15.6 billion euros , according to the federal statistics office . the german government expects output to shrink 2.25 percent this year . " so far , there are no visible signs of a fast recovery : the economies in industrial countries remain weak and the current crisis in eastern europe is a further strain , " commerzbank 's junker said . since a large proportion of germany 's european trade comes from countries in the former eastern bloc , which are not euro-zone members , a sharp depreciation of their currencies against the euro has hurt their purchasing power . df / sms / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are ways of honoring someone you admire , and then there are simply poor ideas .
two german discount food retailers have hit upon the latter by naming their new fried chicken product " obama fingers . " " haehnchenstueckchen paniert nach suedstaatenart " ... that 's the clumsy german translation for " southern fried chicken , " and two supermarket discounters have displayed a likewise maladroit understanding of american culture in bringing out a new frozen food delicacy . apparently unaware of the historically racist stereotypes connected this particular food item in the united states , the plus and netto food retailers have chosen to pay homage to everybody 's favorite leader of the free world by using his name for 500-gram packages of ready-to-be-reheated bird parts . the packaging features a picture of something remotely resembling the golden gate bridge - the statue of liberty was presumably unavailable for the photo shoot - and is part of a seven-day trial " america week " the supermarkets are conducting . bizarrely , the chicken snacks also come with curry sauce - not exactly a typical condiment south of the mason-dixon line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's he going to use now to make a point ?
a spokesperson for the manufacturer told ap news agency the company hoped to cash on obama 's charisma and boost sales on the back of the president 's popularity . admirable honesty , but charisma - as history teaches us - tends not to be transferrable to things that are hacked apart , stuffed inside a cardboard box and deep frozen . the fingers will probably be off the shelves by april 3 , when their namesake is scheduled to visit german chancellor angela merkel . but if they 're not , the chancellor should be wary causing utter befuddlement and potential offense to her guest - and simply serve him up some good old german sausage . jc / sms / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a major oil transit route , somalia 's coast is prone to pirate attacks . germany turned over nine pirates , arrested for attacking a merchant vessel in the gulf of aden off the somali coast last week , to kenya on tuesday , march 10 . the german navy frigate rheinland pfalz had seized the alleged pirates when they used bazookas and firearms to attack a german-owned merchant vessel .
since there were no german crew members and the vessel was sailing under an antiguan flag , prosecutors in berlin stated that national interests were not sufficiently at stake to try the captives in germany . although most pirates operating in the gulf of aden are from somalia , a former italian colony located in the horn of africa , the nation lacks a functioning legal system to stage a proper trial . handover possible after eu-kenyan deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since last year 24 pirates in all were handed over to kenya but kenya , which borders somalia to the southwest , has a justice system that meets the requirements set by germany , although human rights advocates have been critical of prison conditions there . human rights watch has said that inmates could be held in detention for months without any charges being pressed and are often denied legal counsel . tuesday 's handover was only possible after an agreement between the european union and kenya had paved the way for somali nationals to be prosecuted in kenya . the eu had specified in a deal last week that the captives can not be subjected to torture or the death sentence .
they would have the right to appear before a judge in a short period of time , would be entitled to legal representation and would be provided with an interpreter if needed . gulf of aden vulnerable to attack kenya 's marine police commander stanley lenamai told the associated press that the suspected pirates , who had arrived in the port city mombasa on tuesday , will be taken to court as soon as interpreters for them are found . the nine suspects bring the total number of people delivered to kenyan courts by foreign navies to 24 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirates demanded $ 25 million for super-tanker sirius star and crew more than 100 ships were attacked last year by pirates off the coast of somalia .
the gulf of aden is a vital transit route leading to the suez canal , where roughly 30 percent of the world 's oil is transported . nato , the eu and other countries , including russia and china , have deployed warships to fight piracy and protect the lucrative multi-billion dollar shipping lanes from the heavily armed pirates who use high-powered speedboats to launch their attacks and kidnap crew members . the german frigate that apprehended the nine men is part of the eu 's anti-piracy mission atalanta . df / sms / dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 're not planning on any additional measures , " steinbrueck told journalists as he arrived for a meeting with his eurozone counterparts in brussels on monday , march 9 .
" we should concentrate on measures that have already been decided . "
german lawmakers this year passed an stimulus package worth 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 63 billion -rrb- to haul europe 's largest economy out of its worst recession in decades .
it includes investments in infrastructure , tax relief , reductions in health care contributions and money for families with children .
it also provides 2,500-euro bonuses to people who junk old cars to buy new vehicles .
the package follows an earlier 23 billion-euro plan , criticized in germany and abroad as too cautious .
lawrence summers , a top economics advisor to us president barack obama , this week urged governments worldwide to pump more public money into their economies to revive falling global demand .
" no rift " with europe on tackling crisis the white house has been trying in recent days to steer clear of an out-and-out confrontation with europe over how to best handle a deep global recession .
while the united states would like to see more stimulus plans , europe has insisted on more financial regulations .
but white house spokesman robert gibbs said on monday president obama believes that regulation is needed to prevent a repeat of the present crisis in the future , and stimulus is required to get the economy moving now . " so i do n't think there 's any rift -lrb- with europe -rrb- at all , " gibbs told reporters .
world leaders are counting on a group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit in london next month to come up with global solutions for dealing with the financial crisis .
the us will use the london meeting to discuss " a number of subjects , both financial regulation and economic stimulus , largely because there is n't one single solution to those problems , " gibbs said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us would like to see more stimulus measures in europe the united states has a stimulus plan of nearly $ 790 billion -lrb- 626 billion euros -rrb- which it hopes will drag it out of what has shaped up to be the deepest recession in decades .
in the european union , countries have agreed to stimulus measures worth about 400 billion euros , the equivalent of 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic process , according to afp news agency .
europe wo n't see much improvement in 2009 economic recovery for the 16 countries which share the euro will not happen this year , eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said monday .
previous forecasts had predicted that the economies would pick up in late 2009 .
" the recovery will take longer than we were expecting only a few months ago , " almunia told journalists after a meeting with euro zone finance ministers in brussels .
the european commission forecast in january that the euro zone would contract 1.9 percent for the whole of 2009 before growing a measly 0.5 percent in 2010 .
" we 'll present a new forecast in may but taking into account the downside risks that have appeared and started to materialize after we presented the january forecasts , i tend to think that this scenario or gradual recovery will be -lrb- postponed -rrb- to 2010 , " almunia said . th / sp / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's the question for the european central bank , which is pondering further cuts in interest rates .
but experts disagree on the benefits of bottoming out rates to stimulate growth . with the ecb 's prime lending rate currently at a record low of 1.5 percent , getting euros has never been so cheap .
but a host of leading bankers have said the rate will have to fall even further if the ecb wants to fight the effects of global economic and financial crisis . indeed , one member of the ecb 's executive board has broken a long-standing taboo and talking about the possibility of a 0 percent interest rate . " if the economic situation worsens , the ecb is ready for further interest rate cuts - even down to zero , " board member lorenzo bini smaghi told the german financial newspaper boersen-zeitung on tuesday , march 10 . smaghi stressed that such an option would only come in for consideration if the euro-zone economy was hit by deflation .
but the mere fact that he mentioned it as a possibility signals how nervous europe 's leading bankers are these days about the prospects for economic recovery . broad consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet has denied that zero is an option , but other experts say it might be still , interest rates are unlikely to hit rock-bottom in the immediate future .
the head of the ecb , jean-claude trichet , has said in the past that a 0 percent interest rate is not on the agenda , and the head of germany 's national bank , axel weber , was quick to reject the option . " i see 1 percent as the lower limit to which the primary refinancing rate can fall , " bundesbank president weber said at a press conference on tuesday . but weber , who is also an ecb director , seemed to indicate that he would support further , smaller cuts in the prime lending rate , as did his ecb colleague juergen stark . " of course , there 's still certain room for monetary-policy maneuvering , " stark , who is responsible for the ecb 's economic and monetary analysis , told reuters news agency on monday . the us federal reserve and the bank of japan has effectively set their main rates at zero . creativity needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb says it 's looking for other ways to boast the economy but at the same time as the experts were suggesting further cuts in rates , they also cautioned against seeing such a strategy as a cure-all for the euro zone 's economic woes . " it wo n't be able to fundamentally solve the problems caused by the financial crisis , " stark said , adding that interest rates that were too low could actually worsen the euro zone 's current difficulties . the european central bank is also looking to explore other avenues to stimulate the bloc 's economy . " we will continue to consult about how - above and beyond interest-rate cuts - we can provide monetary-policy impulses , " weber said . it 's unclear what those alternative measures could be , but they will not include buying government bonds .
the experts reject that idea , which has been used , for example , in england , as being contrary to the spirit of fair competition with the euro zone . jc / sms / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new data shows the country 's trade surplus for january was only half of the amount of a year ago . german exports dived 20.7 percent in january 2009 compared to a year ago , its biggest drop in the last 16 years . the world 's leading export nation exported 66.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 85 billion -rrb- worth of goods in january 2009 compared to 84 billion euros reported the previous year , according to preliminary figures released from the federal statistics office in wiesbaden on tuesday , march 10 . germany has been especially hard hit by the global recession , with a steep decline in its key export markets in europe and asia . " the growth engine of the german economy is out of fuel , " said ing economist carsten brzeski .
" any stabilization of the economy of the economy in 2007 will have to come from domestic demand , " he told the dpa news agency . sharper export decline in non-eu countries the decline marked germany 's fourth consecutive monthly drop in exports as europe 's largest economy faces its worst recession since the end of world war ii .
german exports to its partners in the euro zone fell by 18.7 percent from 2008 .
exports to non-eu countries plunged by 24.5 percent of 2008 levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's trade surplus dived to half in january from a year ago the sharp contraction in key industries such as engineering goods and the auto industry contributed significantly to the fall in exports . january 2009 imports also fell by 12.9 percent from 67 billion euros in 2008 to 58 billion euros .
the drop represents a 4.4 percent drop from december alone , making it the fourth consecutive monthly decline as well . commerzbank analyst simon junker told the afp news agency that " foreign trade is expected to have a sharp negative impact on growth again in the first quarter " of 2009 . german exports hard hit in eastern europe germany 's trade surplus was down to 8.5 billion euros , compared with double the amount - 17 billion euros - in january 2008 . a current account surplus , which is the broadest measure of trade activity that includes services and financial transfers , plunged more than three-fold to 4.2 billion euros from 15.6 billion euros , according to the federal statistics office . the german government expects output to shrink 2.25 percent this year . " so far , there are no visible signs of a fast recovery : the economies in industrial countries remain weak and the current crisis in eastern europe is a further strain , " commerzbank 's junker said . since a large proportion of germany 's european trade comes from countries in the former eastern bloc , which are not euro-zone members , a sharp depreciation of their currencies against the euro has hurt their purchasing power . df / sms / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 're not planning on any additional measures , " steinbrueck told journalists as he arrived for a meeting with his eurozone counterparts in brussels on monday , march 9 .
" we should concentrate on measures that have already been decided . "
german lawmakers this year passed an stimulus package worth 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 63 billion -rrb- to haul europe 's largest economy out of its worst recession in decades .
it includes investments in infrastructure , tax relief , reductions in health care contributions and money for families with children .
it also provides 2,500-euro bonuses to people who junk old cars to buy new vehicles .
the package follows an earlier 23 billion-euro plan , criticized in germany and abroad as too cautious .
lawrence summers , a top economics advisor to us president barack obama , this week urged governments worldwide to pump more public money into their economies to revive falling global demand .
" no rift " with europe on tackling crisis the white house has been trying in recent days to steer clear of an out-and-out confrontation with europe over how to best handle a deep global recession .
while the united states would like to see more stimulus plans , europe has insisted on more financial regulations .
but white house spokesman robert gibbs said on monday president obama believes that regulation is needed to prevent a repeat of the present crisis in the future , and stimulus is required to get the economy moving now . " so i do n't think there 's any rift -lrb- with europe -rrb- at all , " gibbs told reporters .
world leaders are counting on a group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit in london next month to come up with global solutions for dealing with the financial crisis .
the us will use the london meeting to discuss " a number of subjects , both financial regulation and economic stimulus , largely because there is n't one single solution to those problems , " gibbs said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us would like to see more stimulus measures in europe the united states has a stimulus plan of nearly $ 790 billion -lrb- 626 billion euros -rrb- which it hopes will drag it out of what has shaped up to be the deepest recession in decades .
in the european union , countries have agreed to stimulus measures worth about 400 billion euros , the equivalent of 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic process , according to afp news agency .
europe wo n't see much improvement in 2009 economic recovery for the 16 countries which share the euro will not happen this year , eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said monday .
previous forecasts had predicted that the economies would pick up in late 2009 .
" the recovery will take longer than we were expecting only a few months ago , " almunia told journalists after a meeting with euro zone finance ministers in brussels .
the european commission forecast in january that the euro zone would contract 1.9 percent for the whole of 2009 before growing a measly 0.5 percent in 2010 .
" we 'll present a new forecast in may but taking into account the downside risks that have appeared and started to materialize after we presented the january forecasts , i tend to think that this scenario or gradual recovery will be -lrb- postponed -rrb- to 2010 , " almunia said . th / sp / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the first appearance of the h5n1 strain in the eu this year . the outbreak " was found in a wild duck shot during a hunt near the town of starnberg in the german state of bavaria , " the european union 's executive arm said in a statement on tuesday , march 10 .
the commission said that germany , which has carried out " protection measures " to ensure the virus is not spread , would not be forced to quarantine the area around where the bird was found or monitor the region .
" on basis of the favorable result of a risk assessment , germany may refrain from the establishment of a control area and a surrounding monitoring area around a positive finding , " the statement said .
" this derogation has been used taking into account that the hunt had already taken place in january . "
though bird flu is difficult for people to catch , the h5n1 strain has killed at least 250 people worldwide .
the last wild-bird case of bird flu in the 27-nation bloc was found in a canadian goose in britain in february last year , while the last outbreak in poultry of h5n1 in the eu was detected last october in the german state of saxony . sms / jc / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new data shows the country 's trade surplus for january was only half of the amount of a year ago . german exports dived 20.7 percent in january 2009 compared to a year ago , its biggest drop in the last 16 years . the world 's leading export nation exported 66.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 85 billion -rrb- worth of goods in january 2009 compared to 84 billion euros reported the previous year , according to preliminary figures released from the federal statistics office in wiesbaden on tuesday , march 10 . germany has been especially hard hit by the global recession , with a steep decline in its key export markets in europe and asia . " the growth engine of the german economy is out of fuel , " said ing economist carsten brzeski .
" any stabilization of the economy of the economy in 2007 will have to come from domestic demand , " he told the dpa news agency . sharper export decline in non-eu countries the decline marked germany 's fourth consecutive monthly drop in exports as europe 's largest economy faces its worst recession since the end of world war ii .
german exports to its partners in the euro zone fell by 18.7 percent from 2008 .
exports to non-eu countries plunged by 24.5 percent of 2008 levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's trade surplus dived to half in january from a year ago the sharp contraction in key industries such as engineering goods and the auto industry contributed significantly to the fall in exports . january 2009 imports also fell by 12.9 percent from 67 billion euros in 2008 to 58 billion euros .
the drop represents a 4.4 percent drop from december alone , making it the fourth consecutive monthly decline as well . commerzbank analyst simon junker told the afp news agency that " foreign trade is expected to have a sharp negative impact on growth again in the first quarter " of 2009 . german exports hard hit in eastern europe germany 's trade surplus was down to 8.5 billion euros , compared with double the amount - 17 billion euros - in january 2008 . a current account surplus , which is the broadest measure of trade activity that includes services and financial transfers , plunged more than three-fold to 4.2 billion euros from 15.6 billion euros , according to the federal statistics office . the german government expects output to shrink 2.25 percent this year . " so far , there are no visible signs of a fast recovery : the economies in industrial countries remain weak and the current crisis in eastern europe is a further strain , " commerzbank 's junker said . since a large proportion of germany 's european trade comes from countries in the former eastern bloc , which are not euro-zone members , a sharp depreciation of their currencies against the euro has hurt their purchasing power . df / sms / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 're not planning on any additional measures , " steinbrueck told journalists as he arrived for a meeting with his eurozone counterparts in brussels on monday , march 9 .
" we should concentrate on measures that have already been decided . "
german lawmakers this year passed an stimulus package worth 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 63 billion -rrb- to haul europe 's largest economy out of its worst recession in decades .
it includes investments in infrastructure , tax relief , reductions in health care contributions and money for families with children .
it also provides 2,500-euro bonuses to people who junk old cars to buy new vehicles .
the package follows an earlier 23 billion-euro plan , criticized in germany and abroad as too cautious .
lawrence summers , a top economics advisor to us president barack obama , this week urged governments worldwide to pump more public money into their economies to revive falling global demand .
" no rift " with europe on tackling crisis the white house has been trying in recent days to steer clear of an out-and-out confrontation with europe over how to best handle a deep global recession .
while the united states would like to see more stimulus plans , europe has insisted on more financial regulations .
but white house spokesman robert gibbs said on monday president obama believes that regulation is needed to prevent a repeat of the present crisis in the future , and stimulus is required to get the economy moving now . " so i do n't think there 's any rift -lrb- with europe -rrb- at all , " gibbs told reporters .
world leaders are counting on a group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit in london next month to come up with global solutions for dealing with the financial crisis .
the us will use the london meeting to discuss " a number of subjects , both financial regulation and economic stimulus , largely because there is n't one single solution to those problems , " gibbs said .

" we 'll present a new forecast in may but taking into account the downside risks that have appeared and started to materialize after we presented the january forecasts , i tend to think that this scenario or gradual recovery will be -lrb- postponed -rrb- to 2010 , " almunia said . th / sp / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but she said the g20 needs to include african nations more in the debate on financial reforms . nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma has been south africa 's minister of foreign affairs since 1999 .
she met with her german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier in berlin on monday , march 9 , as part of a four-nation european tour aimed at consolidating bilateral political , economic and trade relations between south africa and european countries . deutsche welle : what are the main common interests between germany and south africa ? nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma : we 're here at the invitation of the foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to strengthen our bilateral relations , which are already good .
but we want to be sure they remain so and grow : in economic cooperation , trade , science and technology and many other areas .
we are very like-minded in many multi-lateral issues , so we share a lot of views in the un and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa is hosting the world cup in 2010 of course , with germany having hosted the fifa world cup , we 're also making use of their experience for our own 2010 world cup and germany has been sharing its experiences with us . foreign minister steinmeier has started many initiatives concerning africa , and there has really been an emphasis placed on african policy here in germany .
have you noticed this ? yes , we have noticed this growing interest and have been working very closely with germany .
in some instances , we work together in a third country in africa to strengthen peace and in programs of reconstruction , like in southern sudan and the democratic republic of congo .
we are very happy that germany is taking this particular interest because africa does need this support and also germany has been very supportive to the african union itself . the current economic crisis is challenging not only the african countries , but also the united states and european countries .
what are you expecting the g20 to do ? i think the g20 should reflect on the fact that africa will be very hard hit by this economic depression .
as they look at packages to salvage their own economies , g20 countries must be thinking about the economies of developing countries , particularly in africa .
also , regarding the millennium development goals , which were already a big challenge , if western countries do not continue giving development aid , those may be undermined and africa may be left out in terms of reaching those goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's development agency gtz is supporting a solar cooker project in south africa we also think that this is an opportunity for the transformation and reform of the bretton woods institutions -lrb- eds. note : the bretton woods system established the international bank for reconstruction and development and the international monetary fund -rrb- .
but we think that needs a broader discussion , not just within the g20 . we also think we need to look at opportunities that may arise from this depression .
if we look at alternative sources of energy , this may be an area of growth that countries like germany and others could invest in in developing countries .
there may be opportunities that we should be able to jointly explore that come from this unfortunate economic depression . you mention the reform of the bretton woods institutions .
do you think africa should have more voice in those institutions ? yes , i think so .
i think that developing countries , particularly in africa , should have a greater voice .
i think there 's a whole range of issues that would need to be looked at if we look at reforming the bretton woods institutions . the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- announced a warrant of arrest against sudanese president omar al-bashir last week .
south africa and others in africa said they regretted the court 's decision because of the indictment 's timing and because the warrant targets a sitting president .
in what way is this icc decision problematic to you ? if you look at sudan , particularly darfur , the african union has been grappling with that situation to try and find a peaceful settlement of that conflict .
of course , the sudanese government is crucial in the finding of that peaceful settlement .

it 's the first killing of a policeman in northern ireland in a decade .

following a callout to an incident near a nationalist republican area , two police cars raced to the scene , the agency said .
gunmen lying in wait opened fire as the officers stepped out of one of the vehicles , according to afp .
the latest incident follows the fatal shooting of two soldiers on saturday , as they received a pizza delivery at their army base north of belfast .
gunmen reportedly entered the base as the pizzas were delivered and fired up to 40 shots in two long bursts of gunfire .

but she said the g20 needs to include african nations more in the debate on financial reforms . nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma has been south africa 's minister of foreign affairs since 1999 .
she met with her german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier in berlin on monday , march 9 , as part of a four-nation european tour aimed at consolidating bilateral political , economic and trade relations between south africa and european countries . deutsche welle : what are the main common interests between germany and south africa ? nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma : we 're here at the invitation of the foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to strengthen our bilateral relations , which are already good .
but we want to be sure they remain so and grow : in economic cooperation , trade , science and technology and many other areas .
we are very like-minded in many multi-lateral issues , so we share a lot of views in the un and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa is hosting the world cup in 2010 of course , with germany having hosted the fifa world cup , we 're also making use of their experience for our own 2010 world cup and germany has been sharing its experiences with us . foreign minister steinmeier has started many initiatives concerning africa , and there has really been an emphasis placed on african policy here in germany .
have you noticed this ? yes , we have noticed this growing interest and have been working very closely with germany .
in some instances , we work together in a third country in africa to strengthen peace and in programs of reconstruction , like in southern sudan and the democratic republic of congo .
we are very happy that germany is taking this particular interest because africa does need this support and also germany has been very supportive to the african union itself . the current economic crisis is challenging not only the african countries , but also the united states and european countries .
what are you expecting the g20 to do ? i think the g20 should reflect on the fact that africa will be very hard hit by this economic depression .
as they look at packages to salvage their own economies , g20 countries must be thinking about the economies of developing countries , particularly in africa .
also , regarding the millennium development goals , which were already a big challenge , if western countries do not continue giving development aid , those may be undermined and africa may be left out in terms of reaching those goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's development agency gtz is supporting a solar cooker project in south africa we also think that this is an opportunity for the transformation and reform of the bretton woods institutions -lrb- eds. note : the bretton woods system established the international bank for reconstruction and development and the international monetary fund -rrb- .
but we think that needs a broader discussion , not just within the g20 . we also think we need to look at opportunities that may arise from this depression .
if we look at alternative sources of energy , this may be an area of growth that countries like germany and others could invest in in developing countries .
there may be opportunities that we should be able to jointly explore that come from this unfortunate economic depression . you mention the reform of the bretton woods institutions .
do you think africa should have more voice in those institutions ? yes , i think so .
i think that developing countries , particularly in africa , should have a greater voice .
i think there 's a whole range of issues that would need to be looked at if we look at reforming the bretton woods institutions . the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- announced a warrant of arrest against sudanese president omar al-bashir last week .
south africa and others in africa said they regretted the court 's decision because of the indictment 's timing and because the warrant targets a sitting president .
in what way is this icc decision problematic to you ? if you look at sudan , particularly darfur , the african union has been grappling with that situation to try and find a peaceful settlement of that conflict .
of course , the sudanese government is crucial in the finding of that peaceful settlement .
at this point in time , when we are busy with that , there 's an indictment of a sitting president .
it does create problems because it may undermine the peace efforts . what are important for us are the millions of lives of those people in darfur - that they can get peace and begin rebuilding their lives .

" we 're not planning on any additional measures , " steinbrueck told journalists as he arrived for a meeting with his eurozone counterparts in brussels on monday , march 9 .
" we should concentrate on measures that have already been decided . "
german lawmakers this year passed an stimulus package worth 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 63 billion -rrb- to haul europe 's largest economy out of its worst recession in decades .
it includes investments in infrastructure , tax relief , reductions in health care contributions and money for families with children .
it also provides 2,500-euro bonuses to people who junk old cars to buy new vehicles .
the package follows an earlier 23 billion-euro plan , criticized in germany and abroad as too cautious .
lawrence summers , a top economics advisor to us president barack obama , this week urged governments worldwide to pump more public money into their economies to revive falling global demand .
" no rift " with europe on tackling crisis the white house has been trying in recent days to steer clear of an out-and-out confrontation with europe over how to best handle a deep global recession .
while the united states would like to see more stimulus plans , europe has insisted on more financial regulations .
but white house spokesman robert gibbs said on monday president obama believes that regulation is needed to prevent a repeat of the present crisis in the future , and stimulus is required to get the economy moving now . " so i do n't think there 's any rift -lrb- with europe -rrb- at all , " gibbs told reporters .
world leaders are counting on a group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit in london next month to come up with global solutions for dealing with the financial crisis .
the us will use the london meeting to discuss " a number of subjects , both financial regulation and economic stimulus , largely because there is n't one single solution to those problems , " gibbs said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us would like to see more stimulus measures in europe the united states has a stimulus plan of nearly $ 790 billion -lrb- 626 billion euros -rrb- which it hopes will drag it out of what has shaped up to be the deepest recession in decades .
in the european union , countries have agreed to stimulus measures worth about 400 billion euros , the equivalent of 3.3 percent of the bloc 's gross domestic process , according to afp news agency .
europe wo n't see much improvement in 2009 economic recovery for the 16 countries which share the euro will not happen this year , eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said monday .
previous forecasts had predicted that the economies would pick up in late 2009 .
" the recovery will take longer than we were expecting only a few months ago , " almunia told journalists after a meeting with euro zone finance ministers in brussels .
the european commission forecast in january that the euro zone would contract 1.9 percent for the whole of 2009 before growing a measly 0.5 percent in 2010 .
" we 'll present a new forecast in may but taking into account the downside risks that have appeared and started to materialize after we presented the january forecasts , i tend to think that this scenario or gradual recovery will be -lrb- postponed -rrb- to 2010 , " almunia said . th / sp / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

net profit for 2008 was 1.6 billion euros .
" we made significant headway in reshaping the company , " louis gallois , chief executive of eads said .
although 2009 would be " challenging " due to an expected overall slump in aircraft orders amid the global economic recession , gallois said that " 2009 deliveries should remain at high levels . "
better results than forecast last year airbus delivered a record 483 aircraft , surpassing its chief competitor , the us-based boeing .
eads said cost cutting measures at its airbus division was largely responsible for its robust profits . the net profits also turned out to be better than expected .

there are ways of honoring someone you admire , and then there are simply poor ideas .
two german discount food retailers have hit upon the latter by naming their new fried chicken product " obama fingers . " " haehnchenstueckchen paniert nach suedstaatenart " ... that 's the clumsy german translation for " southern fried chicken , " and two supermarket discounters have displayed a likewise maladroit understanding of american culture in bringing out a new frozen food delicacy . apparently unaware of the historically racist stereotypes connected this particular food item in the united states , the plus and netto food retailers have chosen to pay homage to everybody 's favorite leader of the free world by using his name for 500-gram packages of ready-to-be-reheated bird parts . the packaging features a picture of something remotely resembling the golden gate bridge - the statue of liberty was presumably unavailable for the photo shoot - and is part of a seven-day trial " america week " the supermarkets are conducting . bizarrely , the chicken snacks also come with curry sauce - not exactly a typical condiment south of the mason-dixon line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's he going to use now to make a point ?
a spokesperson for the manufacturer told ap news agency the company hoped to cash on obama 's charisma and boost sales on the back of the president 's popularity . admirable honesty , but charisma - as history teaches us - tends not to be transferrable to things that are hacked apart , stuffed inside a cardboard box and deep frozen . the fingers will probably be off the shelves by april 3 , when their namesake is scheduled to visit german chancellor angela merkel . but if they 're not , the chancellor should be wary causing utter befuddlement and potential offense to her guest - and simply serve him up some good old german sausage . jc / sms / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but she said the g20 needs to include african nations more in the debate on financial reforms . nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma has been south africa 's minister of foreign affairs since 1999 .
she met with her german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier in berlin on monday , march 9 , as part of a four-nation european tour aimed at consolidating bilateral political , economic and trade relations between south africa and european countries . deutsche welle : what are the main common interests between germany and south africa ? nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma : we 're here at the invitation of the foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to strengthen our bilateral relations , which are already good .
but we want to be sure they remain so and grow : in economic cooperation , trade , science and technology and many other areas .
we are very like-minded in many multi-lateral issues , so we share a lot of views in the un and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa is hosting the world cup in 2010 of course , with germany having hosted the fifa world cup , we 're also making use of their experience for our own 2010 world cup and germany has been sharing its experiences with us . foreign minister steinmeier has started many initiatives concerning africa , and there has really been an emphasis placed on african policy here in germany .
have you noticed this ? yes , we have noticed this growing interest and have been working very closely with germany .
in some instances , we work together in a third country in africa to strengthen peace and in programs of reconstruction , like in southern sudan and the democratic republic of congo .
we are very happy that germany is taking this particular interest because africa does need this support and also germany has been very supportive to the african union itself . the current economic crisis is challenging not only the african countries , but also the united states and european countries .
what are you expecting the g20 to do ? i think the g20 should reflect on the fact that africa will be very hard hit by this economic depression .
as they look at packages to salvage their own economies , g20 countries must be thinking about the economies of developing countries , particularly in africa .
also , regarding the millennium development goals , which were already a big challenge , if western countries do not continue giving development aid , those may be undermined and africa may be left out in terms of reaching those goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's development agency gtz is supporting a solar cooker project in south africa we also think that this is an opportunity for the transformation and reform of the bretton woods institutions -lrb- eds. note : the bretton woods system established the international bank for reconstruction and development and the international monetary fund -rrb- .
but we think that needs a broader discussion , not just within the g20 . we also think we need to look at opportunities that may arise from this depression .
if we look at alternative sources of energy , this may be an area of growth that countries like germany and others could invest in in developing countries .
there may be opportunities that we should be able to jointly explore that come from this unfortunate economic depression . you mention the reform of the bretton woods institutions .
do you think africa should have more voice in those institutions ? yes , i think so .
i think that developing countries , particularly in africa , should have a greater voice .
i think there 's a whole range of issues that would need to be looked at if we look at reforming the bretton woods institutions . the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- announced a warrant of arrest against sudanese president omar al-bashir last week .
south africa and others in africa said they regretted the court 's decision because of the indictment 's timing and because the warrant targets a sitting president .
in what way is this icc decision problematic to you ? if you look at sudan , particularly darfur , the african union has been grappling with that situation to try and find a peaceful settlement of that conflict .
of course , the sudanese government is crucial in the finding of that peaceful settlement .
at this point in time , when we are busy with that , there 's an indictment of a sitting president .
it does create problems because it may undermine the peace efforts . what are important for us are the millions of lives of those people in darfur - that they can get peace and begin rebuilding their lives .
we thought that this was really the wrong time and we tried to say , let the court defer it , even for a year .
it is provided for in the rome statutes -lrb- eds. note : the treaty that established the icc -rrb- .
we thought if this was deferred for a year - and to just give peace a chance - that would have been better . do you think the icc decision could provoke a new confrontation between international institutions like the icc and africa ? we just think it 's a pity that they took this decision at this point in time , which is undermining the work that the african union is trying to do . ute schaeffer interviewed nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's the question for the european central bank , which is pondering further cuts in interest rates .
but experts disagree on the benefits of bottoming out rates to stimulate growth . with the ecb 's prime lending rate currently at a record low of 1.5 percent , getting euros has never been so cheap .
but a host of leading bankers have said the rate will have to fall even further if the ecb wants to fight the effects of global economic and financial crisis . indeed , one member of the ecb 's executive board has broken a long-standing taboo and talking about the possibility of a 0 percent interest rate . " if the economic situation worsens , the ecb is ready for further interest rate cuts - even down to zero , " board member lorenzo bini smaghi told the german financial newspaper boersen-zeitung on tuesday , march 10 . smaghi stressed that such an option would only come in for consideration if the euro-zone economy was hit by deflation .
but the mere fact that he mentioned it as a possibility signals how nervous europe 's leading bankers are these days about the prospects for economic recovery . broad consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet has denied that zero is an option , but other experts say it might be still , interest rates are unlikely to hit rock-bottom in the immediate future .
the head of the ecb , jean-claude trichet , has said in the past that a 0 percent interest rate is not on the agenda , and the head of germany 's national bank , axel weber , was quick to reject the option . " i see 1 percent as the lower limit to which the primary refinancing rate can fall , " bundesbank president weber said at a press conference on tuesday . but weber , who is also an ecb director , seemed to indicate that he would support further , smaller cuts in the prime lending rate , as did his ecb colleague juergen stark . " of course , there 's still certain room for monetary-policy maneuvering , " stark , who is responsible for the ecb 's economic and monetary analysis , told reuters news agency on monday . the us federal reserve and the bank of japan has effectively set their main rates at zero . creativity needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb says it 's looking for other ways to boast the economy but at the same time as the experts were suggesting further cuts in rates , they also cautioned against seeing such a strategy as a cure-all for the euro zone 's economic woes . " it wo n't be able to fundamentally solve the problems caused by the financial crisis , " stark said , adding that interest rates that were too low could actually worsen the euro zone 's current difficulties . the european central bank is also looking to explore other avenues to stimulate the bloc 's economy . " we will continue to consult about how - above and beyond interest-rate cuts - we can provide monetary-policy impulses , " weber said . it 's unclear what those alternative measures could be , but they will not include buying government bonds .
the experts reject that idea , which has been used , for example , in england , as being contrary to the spirit of fair competition with the euro zone . jc / sms / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's after the bundesbank - the country 's national bank - posted 6.3 billion euros in profits for last year .
but falling interest rates could bring a downturn . bundesbank president axel weber announced the rise in profits at a news conference in frankfurt am main on tuesday , march 10 . the bank , he said , had earned the equivalent of $ 8 billion in 2008 - an increase of around 50 percent over the previous year . " despite the hefty increase in reserves , the bundesbank 's profits are markedly higher , " weber said . the entire sum earned is being transferred to the federal government - which is something of a novelty .
in previous years , portions of the bundesbank 's earnings have had to be used to pay off debt from the former east germany , but now that the debt is gone , the bank 's profits will flow into state coffers . the additional 6.3 billion euros will come as very welcome news to chancellor angela merkel 's government , which is looking for every spare euro it can find after agreeing to engage in deficit spending in an attempt to combat the effects of the global financial and economic crisis . the government has already promised billions in bail-outs to the banking industry and said it would consider loan guarantees and other rescue measures to other industries . prime rate key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesbank president weber had good news and bad news weber said most of the bank 's profits had been earned from lending money to banks . " the increase is above all due to profits on interest in euros , " weber explained at the press conference , adding that the increased value of the bank 's assets in us dollars and its gold reserves had also contributed to the positive figures . but that news is also cause for concern due to the current downward trend in european interest rates . the european central bank 's prime lending rate prior to the outbreak of the financial crisis in the second half of 2008 stood at 4.25 percent . the ecb has since slashed it to a mere 1.5 percent , and many commentators are saying further rate decreases , perhaps all the way down to zero , may be necessary . such a step could dramatically reduce the bundesbank 's profits for 2009 . no dancing in the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank probably ca n't expect the same results for 2009 despite the good coming his own institution , weber himself painted a gloomy picture of the economic future - both globally and for germany in particular . " because of declining demands for experts , the german economy is especially affected , " he said , referring to the economic crisis . weber said he expected the 2009 inflation rate in germany to be 0 percent - a figure that gives rise to fears of deflation and worries that the recession could turn into a full-scale economic depression . but weber said he did not think deflation was a serious danger . jc / sms / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the first killing of a policeman in northern ireland in a decade .
police said they have arrested two males , aged 17 and 37 , in the connection with the officer 's murder . the officer was killed in an apparent ambush , according to the afp news agency .
following a callout to an incident near a nationalist republican area , two police cars raced to the scene , the agency said .
gunmen lying in wait opened fire as the officers stepped out of one of the vehicles , according to afp .
the latest incident follows the fatal shooting of two soldiers on saturday , as they received a pizza delivery at their army base north of belfast .
gunmen reportedly entered the base as the pizzas were delivered and fired up to 40 shots in two long bursts of gunfire .
fears for political stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latest incident comes after the shooting of two british soldiers at an army base the killings have raised fears that northern ireland 's political stability is under threat .
the current power-sharing government unites former arch enemies across the protestant-catholic divide .
" we are staring into the abyss and i would appeal to people to pull back , " dolores kelly , a nationalist sdlp lawmaker and member of the northern ireland policing board , was quoted as saying by sky news television .
political leaders haved vowed the violence would not shake the province 's progress to peace .
northern ireland 's first minister peter robinson said he was " sickened " by the attacks .
britain 's northern ireland secretary shaun woodward added : " we must not allow them the capacity to undermine the political process . "
no group has taken responsibility for killing the policeman but the real ira , - a dissident group of the irish republican army - said it was responsible for the shooting of the two british soldiers .
the real ira was also behind northern ireland 's most deadly attack , the 1998 omagh bombing which killed 29 people .
history of bloodshed northern ireland was racked for three decades by violence which began in the 1960s .
more than 3,000 people were killed in the conflict between nationalist catholics and loyalist protestants in northern ireland .
the last british military death in the conflict was in 1997 and the good friday agreement was signed the following year .
in 2007 , the mainly protestant democratic unionists , which want northern ireland to remain part of britain , and the catholic sinn fein , which supports integration into the republic of ireland , established the present power-sharing government , which has devolved power from london . sp / sms / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but she said the g20 needs to include african nations more in the debate on financial reforms . nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma has been south africa 's minister of foreign affairs since 1999 .
she met with her german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier in berlin on monday , march 9 , as part of a four-nation european tour aimed at consolidating bilateral political , economic and trade relations between south africa and european countries . deutsche welle : what are the main common interests between germany and south africa ? nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma : we 're here at the invitation of the foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to strengthen our bilateral relations , which are already good .
but we want to be sure they remain so and grow : in economic cooperation , trade , science and technology and many other areas .
we are very like-minded in many multi-lateral issues , so we share a lot of views in the un and elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa is hosting the world cup in 2010 of course , with germany having hosted the fifa world cup , we 're also making use of their experience for our own 2010 world cup and germany has been sharing its experiences with us . foreign minister steinmeier has started many initiatives concerning africa , and there has really been an emphasis placed on african policy here in germany .
have you noticed this ? yes , we have noticed this growing interest and have been working very closely with germany .
in some instances , we work together in a third country in africa to strengthen peace and in programs of reconstruction , like in southern sudan and the democratic republic of congo .
we are very happy that germany is taking this particular interest because africa does need this support and also germany has been very supportive to the african union itself . the current economic crisis is challenging not only the african countries , but also the united states and european countries .
what are you expecting the g20 to do ? i think the g20 should reflect on the fact that africa will be very hard hit by this economic depression .
as they look at packages to salvage their own economies , g20 countries must be thinking about the economies of developing countries , particularly in africa .
also , regarding the millennium development goals , which were already a big challenge , if western countries do not continue giving development aid , those may be undermined and africa may be left out in terms of reaching those goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's development agency gtz is supporting a solar cooker project in south africa we also think that this is an opportunity for the transformation and reform of the bretton woods institutions -lrb- eds. note : the bretton woods system established the international bank for reconstruction and development and the international monetary fund -rrb- .
but we think that needs a broader discussion , not just within the g20 . we also think we need to look at opportunities that may arise from this depression .
if we look at alternative sources of energy , this may be an area of growth that countries like germany and others could invest in in developing countries .
there may be opportunities that we should be able to jointly explore that come from this unfortunate economic depression . you mention the reform of the bretton woods institutions .
do you think africa should have more voice in those institutions ? yes , i think so .
i think that developing countries , particularly in africa , should have a greater voice .
i think there 's a whole range of issues that would need to be looked at if we look at reforming the bretton woods institutions . the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- announced a warrant of arrest against sudanese president omar al-bashir last week .
south africa and others in africa said they regretted the court 's decision because of the indictment 's timing and because the warrant targets a sitting president .
in what way is this icc decision problematic to you ? if you look at sudan , particularly darfur , the african union has been grappling with that situation to try and find a peaceful settlement of that conflict .
of course , the sudanese government is crucial in the finding of that peaceful settlement .
at this point in time , when we are busy with that , there 's an indictment of a sitting president .
it does create problems because it may undermine the peace efforts . what are important for us are the millions of lives of those people in darfur - that they can get peace and begin rebuilding their lives .
we thought that this was really the wrong time and we tried to say , let the court defer it , even for a year .
it is provided for in the rome statutes -lrb- eds. note : the treaty that established the icc -rrb- .
we thought if this was deferred for a year - and to just give peace a chance - that would have been better . do you think the icc decision could provoke a new confrontation between international institutions like the icc and africa ? we just think it 's a pity that they took this decision at this point in time , which is undermining the work that the african union is trying to do . ute schaeffer interviewed nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

also , regarding the millennium development goals , which were already a big challenge , if western countries do not continue giving development aid , those may be undermined and africa may be left out in terms of reaching those goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's development agency gtz is supporting a solar cooker project in south africa we also think that this is an opportunity for the transformation and reform of the bretton woods institutions -lrb- eds. note : the bretton woods system established the international bank for reconstruction and development and the international monetary fund -rrb- .
but we think that needs a broader discussion , not just within the g20 . we also think we need to look at opportunities that may arise from this depression .
if we look at alternative sources of energy , this may be an area of growth that countries like germany and others could invest in in developing countries .
there may be opportunities that we should be able to jointly explore that come from this unfortunate economic depression . you mention the reform of the bretton woods institutions .
do you think africa should have more voice in those institutions ? yes , i think so .
i think that developing countries , particularly in africa , should have a greater voice .
i think there 's a whole range of issues that would need to be looked at if we look at reforming the bretton woods institutions . the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- announced a warrant of arrest against sudanese president omar al-bashir last week .
south africa and others in africa said they regretted the court 's decision because of the indictment 's timing and because the warrant targets a sitting president .
in what way is this icc decision problematic to you ? if you look at sudan , particularly darfur , the african union has been grappling with that situation to try and find a peaceful settlement of that conflict .
of course , the sudanese government is crucial in the finding of that peaceful settlement .
at this point in time , when we are busy with that , there 's an indictment of a sitting president .
it does create problems because it may undermine the peace efforts . what are important for us are the millions of lives of those people in darfur - that they can get peace and begin rebuilding their lives .
we thought that this was really the wrong time and we tried to say , let the court defer it , even for a year .
it is provided for in the rome statutes -lrb- eds. note : the treaty that established the icc -rrb- .
we thought if this was deferred for a year - and to just give peace a chance - that would have been better . do you think the icc decision could provoke a new confrontation between international institutions like the icc and africa ? we just think it 's a pity that they took this decision at this point in time , which is undermining the work that the african union is trying to do . ute schaeffer interviewed nkosazana clarice dlamini zuma editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , authorities said berlin has told the european commission that a case of bird flu involving a strain of the virus that can be lethal to humans was discovered in germany .
it 's the first appearance of the h5n1 strain in the eu this year . the outbreak " was found in a wild duck shot during a hunt near the town of starnberg in the german state of bavaria , " the european union 's executive arm said in a statement on tuesday , march 10 .
the commission said that germany , which has carried out " protection measures " to ensure the virus is not spread , would not be forced to quarantine the area around where the bird was found or monitor the region .
" on basis of the favorable result of a risk assessment , germany may refrain from the establishment of a control area and a surrounding monitoring area around a positive finding , " the statement said .
" this derogation has been used taking into account that the hunt had already taken place in january . "
though bird flu is difficult for people to catch , the h5n1 strain has killed at least 250 people worldwide .
the last wild-bird case of bird flu in the 27-nation bloc was found in a canadian goose in britain in february last year , while the last outbreak in poultry of h5n1 in the eu was detected last october in the german state of saxony . sms / jc / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's after the bundesbank - the country 's national bank - posted 6.3 billion euros in profits for last year .
but falling interest rates could bring a downturn . bundesbank president axel weber announced the rise in profits at a news conference in frankfurt am main on tuesday , march 10 . the bank , he said , had earned the equivalent of $ 8 billion in 2008 - an increase of around 50 percent over the previous year . " despite the hefty increase in reserves , the bundesbank 's profits are markedly higher , " weber said . the entire sum earned is being transferred to the federal government - which is something of a novelty .
in previous years , portions of the bundesbank 's earnings have had to be used to pay off debt from the former east germany , but now that the debt is gone , the bank 's profits will flow into state coffers . the additional 6.3 billion euros will come as very welcome news to chancellor angela merkel 's government , which is looking for every spare euro it can find after agreeing to engage in deficit spending in an attempt to combat the effects of the global financial and economic crisis . the government has already promised billions in bail-outs to the banking industry and said it would consider loan guarantees and other rescue measures to other industries . prime rate key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesbank president weber had good news and bad news weber said most of the bank 's profits had been earned from lending money to banks . " the increase is above all due to profits on interest in euros , " weber explained at the press conference , adding that the increased value of the bank 's assets in us dollars and its gold reserves had also contributed to the positive figures . but that news is also cause for concern due to the current downward trend in european interest rates . the european central bank 's prime lending rate prior to the outbreak of the financial crisis in the second half of 2008 stood at 4.25 percent . the ecb has since slashed it to a mere 1.5 percent , and many commentators are saying further rate decreases , perhaps all the way down to zero , may be necessary . such a step could dramatically reduce the bundesbank 's profits for 2009 . no dancing in the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank probably ca n't expect the same results for 2009 despite the good coming his own institution , weber himself painted a gloomy picture of the economic future - both globally and for germany in particular . " because of declining demands for experts , the german economy is especially affected , " he said , referring to the economic crisis . weber said he expected the 2009 inflation rate in germany to be 0 percent - a figure that gives rise to fears of deflation and worries that the recession could turn into a full-scale economic depression . but weber said he did not think deflation was a serious danger . jc / sms / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

net profit for 2008 was 1.6 billion euros .
" we made significant headway in reshaping the company , " louis gallois , chief executive of eads said .
although 2009 would be " challenging " due to an expected overall slump in aircraft orders amid the global economic recession , gallois said that " 2009 deliveries should remain at high levels . "
better results than forecast last year airbus delivered a record 483 aircraft , surpassing its chief competitor , the us-based boeing .
eads said cost cutting measures at its airbus division was largely responsible for its robust profits . the net profits also turned out to be better than expected .
industry analysts polled by dow jones newswires , had forecast a net profit of only 1.3 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads military aircraft will be integrated into its airbus division in addition to airbus passenger jets , eads also manufactures military aircraft , rockets , satellites and defense communications systems .
setback in eads military division the company admitted that its new a400m military transport aircraft has been beset with technical problems , forcing it to delay its first flight .
but gallois remained optimistic about the company 's prospects .
" even if the a400m program required enormous attention , the group has regained stability in 2008 and is proving to be resilient in the face of the turbulent global economic environment , " he said .
last month , eads announced it would integrate the military transport aircraft division into its airbus commercial airliner operation , and named a spanish aeronautical engineer domingo urena-raso to head the separate airbus military unit .
on monday , the german defense ministry confirmed its order for the a400m transporter after a news report had suggested the contract would be cancelled .
besides germany , france and ten other nations have ordered the turbo-prop military plane , which resembles its us counterpart the lockheed martin c-130 hercules .
in berlin , a defense ministry spokesman said that in spite of production delays , germany needed the 60 planes on order , explaining that it was the final delivery date , rather than the test-flight date that mattered .
altogether eads has 192 a400m transporters worth 20 billion euros on order .
berlin , paris offer credit lines to aircraft buyers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin and paris have pledged financial support for eads the german government also joined france on tuesday in helping buyers of commercial airbus jets by offering credit lines amid fears international banks might restrict lending .
germany 's federal bank kfw and its export credit guarantees agency hermes will permit customers to continue buying airbus aircraft .
" the objective is to help reliable customers abroad to solve their financing problems , thus securing exports of our planes , " peter hintze the german government 's aerospace co-ordinator told dpa news agency .
paris is also launching a similar program to encourage sales of airbus jets . eads is a european consortium dominated by german and french shareholder interests .
the french business daily les echos said that five billion euros in credit from the french government would help cash-strapped airlines honor their commitments to airbus orders as well as other eads products . more than 40 percent of eads stock is publicly traded on several european stock exchanges . unlike many companies that cut dividends to shareholders because of the economic slump , eads said it would pay 20 cents per share for 2008 , up from 12 cents the previous year . df / sp / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

believe it or not , once upon a time , newspapers and television news bulletins were full of actual news involving actual people , much of it generated by reporters on the crime beat .
the demise of the crime reporter , and the decline of investigative journalism in general , has coincided almost perfectly during the past 20 years with the rise of celebrity news .
tittle-tattle about soap stars , premier league footballers , tv chefs and even those who " starred " in shows like big brother now makes up the bulk of tabloid newspaper content , and it has seeped inevitably into upmarket papers and tv news and current affairs programmes .
this is a world in which the first photograph of tv presenter davina mccall , pregnant , walking down the street , was sold to a newspaper for £ 7,500 .
death of fleet street other factors have no doubt played a part - the rise of public relations -lrb- pr -rrb- and press officers and the gradual move away from fleet street by the national newspapers meant the culture of journalists getting out of their offices and chatting to detectives , lawyers , politicians , entrepreneurs and other " sources " over a drink in a pub has ebbed away .
" hard news is declining and there has been a movement towards ' lifestyle journalism ' , often provided by prs or agencies .
it is cheap and fairly easy , " says bob franklin , professor of journalism studies at cardiff university .
he says : " i often wonder why we train our students to cover the courts and council meetings because when they get jobs they rarely have to do either .
journalists do not get out of their offices as much as they used to .
there is a lot more juggling the wires -lsb- news agencies -rsb- and press releases . "
newspapers do n't want to run lengthy court reports .
we are playing up to an attention deficit disorder " duncan campbell the guardian changing newspapers 1979-2009 " after all , discussing the latest celebrity dress is easier than uncovering corruption on a local council . "
duncan campbell , the guardian 's long-time crime correspondent , who is retiring this year after four decades in journalism , says : " nowadays you get much more homogenous news with all the media chasing the same stories . "
" most newspapers , and the bbc and others , have websites and they can see from the number of hits a story gets what is popular .
" you will find a story about -lsb- cristiano -rsb- ronaldo or kate moss will be massively hit , which you will not necessarily get from an interesting story with nobody famous in it . "
campbell says crime coverage has been one of the biggest casualties , with newspapers and broadcasters massively downsizing their teams .
retreat of the reporters old bailey reporter dave st george can vouch for that .
" i started here in 1969 when i was asked to supply the telegraph , mirror and the standard , " he says .
" in those days pa -lsb- the press association -rsb- had seven people covering the old bailey , and the express , mail and the times all had staffers down here . "
pa now has two hard-working but over-stretched journalists covering the old bailey and supplying copy to the national newspapers , who long ago withdrew their court reporters back to their offices . "
the other day there was a fellow jailed for 30 years for shooting at a policeman .
that would have been a big story a few years ago , but nowadays it does n't even merit a mention " dave st george st george says : " i used to get four or five stories in the telegraph every day .
now i never hear from the newsdesks from one year to the next .
they 're filling the papers with all this other stuff .
" the other day there was a fellow jailed for 30 years for shooting at a policeman .
that would have been a big story a few years ago , but nowadays it does n't even merit a mention , " st george says .
the case of carlton sam only merited three paragraphs in the sun and one paragraph in the mirror .
no other national newspaper reported it .
ironically the reduction in coverage coincides with a rise in the number of crimes .
" in the 1970s if we had one homicide a fortnight it was big news , " st george says .
this week there are 11 ongoing murder trials at the old bailey .
so have readers just had their fill of crime ?
would they rather read about the new mansion ronaldo has bought or discover why an eastenders actress has split up with her boyfriend ?
yes , says mark frith , former editor of heat magazine and author of the celeb diaries .
" there was an untapped market and the whole -lsb- princess -rsb- diana phenomenon showed that people wanted to read about people in the public eye , " he says .
" posh and becks was the start of the celebrity age and since then it has moved on to people like jade goody , who was the most read story on the bbc website two days running . "
frith says : " editors have to decide which stories will engage their readers and they will not mourn for stories that they have not got room for . "
a spokesman for the daily telegraph told the bbc : " our aim is to provide up-to-date , reliable news and comment for our readers from a range of voices .
we believe we have been successful in that , including appealing to changing audiences , which is why we remain the market-leading news provider . "
professor justin lewis , head of the school of journalism , media and cultural studies at cardiff university , has conducted research on the changing content of newspapers .
he says : " there is no doubt that celebrity news as a category has grown markedly , especially in broadcasting .
" there is a perception that that is what people want but there is not actually that much evidence that it is .
people may say it sells newspapers , but clearly it does n't because circulation is still going down . "
but he adds : " i do n't think there is a shortage of crime coverage , but it 's just a different type .
big newsworthy crimes still get covered rather than the day-to-day business of the courts . "
tv to blame ?
jeff edwards , who was the mirror 's crime correspondent until being made redundant last year , agrees : " i do n't think crime reporting is dead .
there is not a huge dropping off in interest in law enforcement .
but there is a dropping off in stories about ordinary people . "
professor franklin says there is no doubt the courts are not covered like they used to be , but he says there is still a big demand from the public for crime stories , especially " cause celebres " like the cases of madeline mccann and shannon matthews .
campbell says : " newspapers do n't want to run lengthy court reports .
we are playing up to an attention deficit disorder .
there is a feeling that people ca n't take large chunks of information , whether it 's on radio , on television or in newspapers . "
he pins part of the blame on tv .
" the concept of rolling news , where the competition is not to explain something better but to have a version up quicker .
speed , rather than depth , has become the essence , " he says .
" decent court reporting is also very people-intensive .
sometimes you may have to hang around for a few days without getting anything in the paper , but you bump into lawyers , police officers , even defendants and somebody tells you something and you get a story emerging . "
campbell 's latest novel is a " requiem for the old days of crime reporting " and focuses on an old bailey reporter struggling with a celebrity-obsessed newsdesk .
he sees the same trends in local newspapers , where cut-backs have meant it is extremely rare to see journalists at most magistrates ' and even crown courts .
but one place where crime reporting thrives is scotland , where tabloid papers regularly lead with tales of organised crime .
the editor of the sunday mail , allan rennie , says : " i do n't know if it 's because scots like crime stories or whether organised crime is more visible up here , more like old-fashioned criminals like the krays . "
rennie adds : " nowadays it 's a fact of life that you ca n't afford to send staff to spend days on end at court . "
he thinks one possible answer would be to allow television cameras inside courts .
changing media the media has changed enormously since the 1970s .
reporters are now equipped with mobile phones , laptops , blackberrys and digital cameras and can file copy much quicker than in the old days .
the general public are often invited to become " citizen journalists " by e-mailing or texting in photographs or reportage of incidents they have witnessed , including pictures of celebs doing embarrassing or even mundane things .
but citizen journalists can not cover court cases - they are not trained in the legal pitfalls and are unlikely to have any shorthand skills - so the criminal justice system goes under-reported .
who cares ?
but does it matter ?
professor lewis says : " the danger is that it potentially distorts our perception of crime . "
st george says there is another danger .
" princes and paupers and politicians can get away with murder if there is nobody on the press bench to report it , " he says .
" and if an accused wants to declare their innocence to the world who is there to report it ? "
campbell says : " who knows how many scandals we have missed ?
people might have got away with a lot of stuff because there are far less investigative journalists going out and actually covering things .
it 's far easier to shove a celebrity picture on a page rather than go out and find a story . "
but he is hopeful for the future .
he says : " there may be a reaction to the trivialisation of the news , to the spin and the vitriol , in ways i ca n't predict .
we are in a period of enormous change and people may want to know about stories in far greater detail . "
if it bleeds , by duncan campbell , is due out this week .
your comments : " news coverage " has all but disappeared .
to be replaced by , -lsb- the infinitely more profitable - so we are told -rsb- , sensationalism , speculation and conjecture of today 's " news stories " .
chris neame , bodrum , turkey i have stopped buying daily newspapers as all the tabloids have simply turned into celebrity gossip magazines and i have no interest in that .
i still get a weekend broadsheet but even then news is pretty thin on the ground .
a sad state of affairs .
vince , hertfordshire , uk the biggest change i 've noticed in news coverage over the past 20 years is that i do n't buy newspapers any more .
i used to buy a morning and evening paper , as did my husband , but now it is very rare .
maybe if i 'm going on a long train journey i 'll invest in one -lrb- mainly for the puzzles page -rrb- but they always seem to be full of the same old rehashed stories and features .
recently i 've taken to picking up a book instead .
jane , southampton , uk i have noticed a great change in the past 10 years and even the past 20 years .
the writing is more simple , and the subject " here today , gone tomorrow " .
i think it 's very sad that the media has moved its position to one of entertainment rather than news .
that probably explains why younger people do n't have a clue who the people are who govern their lives and only aspire to be like the latest pop sensation .
michael hunter , stourbridge , uk indeed there seems a bit less crime coverage but this is a very good thing !
excessive journalistic coverage of crime has contributed to a widespread belief that crime is rising even when it is actually falling , with tragic social consequences for us all .
w , blakesley , uk although there has been a reduction in crime stories we still have a vast number of fear-generating news stories .
knife crime is a prime example of this phenomenon with the tabloids creating the impression that down every dark alley in london a knife wielding criminal is lurking .
l. freeman , london i buy a newspaper every day mainly for the showbiz gossip .
i think a newspaper should be seen as an entertainment forum as well as providing real news .
the simple truth is that showbiz stories sell more newspapers than typical crime stories and that is probably why there are now so many more weekly showbiz magazines filling up newsagents ' shelves .

celebrity gossip has forced out a lot of hard news in modern newspapers believe it or not , once upon a time , newspapers and television news bulletins were full of actual news involving actual people , much of it generated by reporters on the crime beat .
the demise of the crime reporter , and the decline of investigative journalism in general , has coincided almost perfectly during the past 20 years with the rise of celebrity news .
tittle-tattle about soap stars , premier league footballers , tv chefs and even those who " starred " in shows like big brother now makes up the bulk of tabloid newspaper content , and it has seeped inevitably into upmarket papers and tv news and current affairs programmes .
this is a world in which the first photograph of tv presenter davina mccall , pregnant , walking down the street , was sold to a newspaper for £ 7,500 .
death of fleet street other factors have no doubt played a part - the rise of public relations -lrb- pr -rrb- and press officers and the gradual move away from fleet street by the national newspapers meant the culture of journalists getting out of their offices and chatting to detectives , lawyers , politicians , entrepreneurs and other " sources " over a drink in a pub has ebbed away .
" hard news is declining and there has been a movement towards ' lifestyle journalism ' , often provided by prs or agencies .
it is cheap and fairly easy , " says bob franklin , professor of journalism studies at cardiff university .
he says : " i often wonder why we train our students to cover the courts and council meetings because when they get jobs they rarely have to do either .
journalists do not get out of their offices as much as they used to .
there is a lot more juggling the wires -lsb- news agencies -rsb- and press releases .
newspapers do n't want to run lengthy court reports .
we are playing up to an attention deficit disorder duncan campbell the guardian changing newspapers 1979-2009 " after all , discussing the latest celebrity dress is easier than uncovering corruption on a local council . "
duncan campbell , the guardian 's long-time crime correspondent , who is retiring this year after four decades in journalism , says : " nowadays you get much more homogenous news with all the media chasing the same stories . "
" most newspapers , and the bbc and others , have websites and they can see from the number of hits a story gets what is popular .
" you will find a story about -lsb- cristiano -rsb- ronaldo or kate moss will be massively hit , which you will not necessarily get from an interesting story with nobody famous in it . "
campbell says crime coverage has been one of the biggest casualties , with newspapers and broadcasters massively downsizing their teams .
retreat of the reporters old bailey reporter dave st george can vouch for that .
" i started here in 1969 when i was asked to supply the telegraph , mirror and the standard , " he says .
" in those days pa -lsb- the press association -rsb- had seven people covering the old bailey , and the express , mail and the times all had staffers down here . "
pa now has two hard-working but over-stretched journalists covering the old bailey and supplying copy to the national newspapers , who long ago withdrew their court reporters back to their offices .
the other day there was a fellow jailed for 30 years for shooting at a policeman .
that would have been a big story a few years ago , but nowadays it does n't even merit a mention dave st george st george says : " i used to get four or five stories in the telegraph every day .
now i never hear from the newsdesks from one year to the next .
they 're filling the papers with all this other stuff .
" the other day there was a fellow jailed for 30 years for shooting at a policeman .
that would have been a big story a few years ago , but nowadays it does n't even merit a mention , " st george says .
the case of carlton sam only merited three paragraphs in the sun and one paragraph in the mirror .
no other national newspaper reported it .
ironically the reduction in coverage coincides with a rise in the number of crimes .
" in the 1970s if we had one homicide a fortnight it was big news , " st george says .
this week there are 11 ongoing murder trials at the old bailey .
so have readers just had their fill of crime ?
would they rather read about the new mansion ronaldo has bought or discover why an eastenders actress has split up with her boyfriend ?
carlton sam , who shot at police , barely merited a mention yes , says mark frith , former editor of heat magazine and author of the celeb diaries .
" there was an untapped market and the whole -lsb- princess -rsb- diana phenomenon showed that people wanted to read about people in the public eye , " he says .
" posh and becks was the start of the celebrity age and since then it has moved on to people like jade goody , who was the most read story on the bbc website two days running . "
frith says : " editors have to decide which stories will engage their readers and they will not mourn for stories that they have not got room for . "
a spokesman for the daily telegraph told the bbc : " our aim is to provide up-to-date , reliable news and comment for our readers from a range of voices .

celebrity gossip has forced out a lot of hard news in modern newspapers believe it or not , once upon a time , newspapers and television news bulletins were full of actual news involving actual people , much of it generated by reporters on the crime beat .
the demise of the crime reporter , and the decline of investigative journalism in general , has coincided almost perfectly during the past 20 years with the rise of celebrity news .
tittle-tattle about soap stars , premier league footballers , tv chefs and even those who " starred " in shows like big brother now makes up the bulk of tabloid newspaper content , and it has seeped inevitably into upmarket papers and tv news and current affairs programmes .
this is a world in which the first photograph of tv presenter davina mccall , pregnant , walking down the street , was sold to a newspaper for £ 7,500 .
death of fleet street other factors have no doubt played a part - the rise of public relations -lrb- pr -rrb- and press officers and the gradual move away from fleet street by the national newspapers meant the culture of journalists getting out of their offices and chatting to detectives , lawyers , politicians , entrepreneurs and other " sources " over a drink in a pub has ebbed away .
" hard news is declining and there has been a movement towards ' lifestyle journalism ' , often provided by prs or agencies .
it is cheap and fairly easy , " says bob franklin , professor of journalism studies at cardiff university .
he says : " i often wonder why we train our students to cover the courts and council meetings because when they get jobs they rarely have to do either .
journalists do not get out of their offices as much as they used to .
there is a lot more juggling the wires -lsb- news agencies -rsb- and press releases .
newspapers do n't want to run lengthy court reports .
we are playing up to an attention deficit disorder duncan campbell the guardian changing newspapers 1979-2009 " after all , discussing the latest celebrity dress is easier than uncovering corruption on a local council . "
duncan campbell , the guardian 's long-time crime correspondent , who is retiring this year after four decades in journalism , says : " nowadays you get much more homogenous news with all the media chasing the same stories . "
" most newspapers , and the bbc and others , have websites and they can see from the number of hits a story gets what is popular .
" you will find a story about -lsb- cristiano -rsb- ronaldo or kate moss will be massively hit , which you will not necessarily get from an interesting story with nobody famous in it . "
campbell says crime coverage has been one of the biggest casualties , with newspapers and broadcasters massively downsizing their teams .
retreat of the reporters old bailey reporter dave st george can vouch for that .
" i started here in 1969 when i was asked to supply the telegraph , mirror and the standard , " he says .
" in those days pa -lsb- the press association -rsb- had seven people covering the old bailey , and the express , mail and the times all had staffers down here . "
pa now has two hard-working but over-stretched journalists covering the old bailey and supplying copy to the national newspapers , who long ago withdrew their court reporters back to their offices .
the other day there was a fellow jailed for 30 years for shooting at a policeman .
that would have been a big story a few years ago , but nowadays it does n't even merit a mention dave st george st george says : " i used to get four or five stories in the telegraph every day .
now i never hear from the newsdesks from one year to the next .
they 're filling the papers with all this other stuff .
" the other day there was a fellow jailed for 30 years for shooting at a policeman .
that would have been a big story a few years ago , but nowadays it does n't even merit a mention , " st george says .
the case of carlton sam only merited three paragraphs in the sun and one paragraph in the mirror .
no other national newspaper reported it .
ironically the reduction in coverage coincides with a rise in the number of crimes .
" in the 1970s if we had one homicide a fortnight it was big news , " st george says .
this week there are 11 ongoing murder trials at the old bailey .
so have readers just had their fill of crime ?
would they rather read about the new mansion ronaldo has bought or discover why an eastenders actress has split up with her boyfriend ?
carlton sam , who shot at police , barely merited a mention yes , says mark frith , former editor of heat magazine and author of the celeb diaries .
" there was an untapped market and the whole -lsb- princess -rsb- diana phenomenon showed that people wanted to read about people in the public eye , " he says .
" posh and becks was the start of the celebrity age and since then it has moved on to people like jade goody , who was the most read story on the bbc website two days running . "
frith says : " editors have to decide which stories will engage their readers and they will not mourn for stories that they have not got room for . "
a spokesman for the daily telegraph told the bbc : " our aim is to provide up-to-date , reliable news and comment for our readers from a range of voices .
we believe we have been successful in that , including appealing to changing audiences , which is why we remain the market-leading news provider . "
professor justin lewis , head of the school of journalism , media and cultural studies at cardiff university , has conducted research on the changing content of newspapers .
he says : " there is no doubt that celebrity news as a category has grown markedly , especially in broadcasting .
" there is a perception that that is what people want but there is not actually that much evidence that it is .
people may say it sells newspapers , but clearly it does n't because circulation is still going down . "
but he adds : " i do n't think there is a shortage of crime coverage , but it 's just a different type .
big newsworthy crimes still get covered rather than the day-to-day business of the courts . "
tv to blame ?
jeff edwards , who was the mirror 's crime correspondent until being made redundant last year , agrees : " i do n't think crime reporting is dead .
there is not a huge dropping off in interest in law enforcement .
but there is a dropping off in stories about ordinary people . "
professor franklin says there is no doubt the courts are not covered like they used to be , but he says there is still a big demand from the public for crime stories , especially " cause celebres " like the cases of madeline mccann and shannon matthews .
campbell says : " newspapers do n't want to run lengthy court reports .
we are playing up to an attention deficit disorder .
there is a feeling that people ca n't take large chunks of information , whether it 's on radio , on television or in newspapers . "
fleet street has changed out of all recognition since the 1970s he pins part of the blame on tv .
" the concept of rolling news , where the competition is not to explain something better but to have a version up quicker .
speed , rather than depth , has become the essence , " he says .
" decent court reporting is also very people-intensive .
sometimes you may have to hang around for a few days without getting anything in the paper , but you bump into lawyers , police officers , even defendants and somebody tells you something and you get a story emerging . "
campbell 's latest novel is a " requiem for the old days of crime reporting " and focuses on an old bailey reporter struggling with a celebrity-obsessed newsdesk .
he sees the same trends in local newspapers , where cut-backs have meant it is extremely rare to see journalists at most magistrates ' and even crown courts .
but one place where crime reporting thrives is scotland , where tabloid papers regularly lead with tales of organised crime .
the editor of the sunday mail , allan rennie , says : " i do n't know if it 's because scots like crime stories or whether organised crime is more visible up here , more like old-fashioned criminals like the krays . "
rennie adds : " nowadays it 's a fact of life that you ca n't afford to send staff to spend days on end at court . "
he thinks one possible answer would be to allow television cameras inside courts .
changing media the media has changed enormously since the 1970s .
in duncan campbell 's book a court reporter battles with his newsdesk reporters are now equipped with mobile phones , laptops , blackberrys and digital cameras and can file copy much quicker than in the old days .
the general public are often invited to become " citizen journalists " by e-mailing or texting in photographs or reportage of incidents they have witnessed , including pictures of celebs doing embarrassing or even mundane things .
but citizen journalists can not cover court cases - they are not trained in the legal pitfalls and are unlikely to have any shorthand skills - so the criminal justice system goes under-reported .
who cares ?
but does it matter ?
professor lewis says : " the danger is that it potentially distorts our perception of crime . "
st george says there is another danger .
" princes and paupers and politicians can get away with murder if there is nobody on the press bench to report it , " he says .
" and if an accused wants to declare their innocence to the world who is there to report it ? "
campbell says : " who knows how many scandals we have missed ?
people might have got away with a lot of stuff because there are far less investigative journalists going out and actually covering things .
it 's far easier to shove a celebrity picture on a page rather than go out and find a story . "
but he is hopeful for the future .
he says : " there may be a reaction to the trivialisation of the news , to the spin and the vitriol , in ways i ca n't predict .
we are in a period of enormous change and people may want to know about stories in far greater detail . "
if it bleeds , by duncan campbell , is due out this week .
your comments : " news coverage " has all but disappeared .

celebrity gossip has forced out a lot of hard news in modern newspapers believe it or not , once upon a time , newspapers and television news bulletins were full of actual news involving actual people , much of it generated by reporters on the crime beat .
the demise of the crime reporter , and the decline of investigative journalism in general , has coincided almost perfectly during the past 20 years with the rise of celebrity news .
tittle-tattle about soap stars , premier league footballers , tv chefs and even those who " starred " in shows like big brother now makes up the bulk of tabloid newspaper content , and it has seeped inevitably into upmarket papers and tv news and current affairs programmes .
this is a world in which the first photograph of tv presenter davina mccall , pregnant , walking down the street , was sold to a newspaper for £ 7,500 .
death of fleet street other factors have no doubt played a part - the rise of public relations -lrb- pr -rrb- and press officers and the gradual move away from fleet street by the national newspapers meant the culture of journalists getting out of their offices and chatting to detectives , lawyers , politicians , entrepreneurs and other " sources " over a drink in a pub has ebbed away .
" hard news is declining and there has been a movement towards ' lifestyle journalism ' , often provided by prs or agencies .
it is cheap and fairly easy , " says bob franklin , professor of journalism studies at cardiff university .
he says : " i often wonder why we train our students to cover the courts and council meetings because when they get jobs they rarely have to do either .
journalists do not get out of their offices as much as they used to .
there is a lot more juggling the wires -lsb- news agencies -rsb- and press releases .
newspapers do n't want to run lengthy court reports .
we are playing up to an attention deficit disorder duncan campbell the guardian changing newspapers 1979-2009 " after all , discussing the latest celebrity dress is easier than uncovering corruption on a local council . "
duncan campbell , the guardian 's long-time crime correspondent , who is retiring this year after four decades in journalism , says : " nowadays you get much more homogenous news with all the media chasing the same stories . "
" most newspapers , and the bbc and others , have websites and they can see from the number of hits a story gets what is popular .
" you will find a story about -lsb- cristiano -rsb- ronaldo or kate moss will be massively hit , which you will not necessarily get from an interesting story with nobody famous in it . "
campbell says crime coverage has been one of the biggest casualties , with newspapers and broadcasters massively downsizing their teams .
retreat of the reporters old bailey reporter dave st george can vouch for that .
" i started here in 1969 when i was asked to supply the telegraph , mirror and the standard , " he says .
" in those days pa -lsb- the press association -rsb- had seven people covering the old bailey , and the express , mail and the times all had staffers down here . "
pa now has two hard-working but over-stretched journalists covering the old bailey and supplying copy to the national newspapers , who long ago withdrew their court reporters back to their offices .
the other day there was a fellow jailed for 30 years for shooting at a policeman .
that would have been a big story a few years ago , but nowadays it does n't even merit a mention dave st george st george says : " i used to get four or five stories in the telegraph every day .
now i never hear from the newsdesks from one year to the next .
they 're filling the papers with all this other stuff .
" the other day there was a fellow jailed for 30 years for shooting at a policeman .
that would have been a big story a few years ago , but nowadays it does n't even merit a mention , " st george says .
the case of carlton sam only merited three paragraphs in the sun and one paragraph in the mirror .
no other national newspaper reported it .
ironically the reduction in coverage coincides with a rise in the number of crimes .
" in the 1970s if we had one homicide a fortnight it was big news , " st george says .
this week there are 11 ongoing murder trials at the old bailey .
so have readers just had their fill of crime ?
would they rather read about the new mansion ronaldo has bought or discover why an eastenders actress has split up with her boyfriend ?
carlton sam , who shot at police , barely merited a mention yes , says mark frith , former editor of heat magazine and author of the celeb diaries .
" there was an untapped market and the whole -lsb- princess -rsb- diana phenomenon showed that people wanted to read about people in the public eye , " he says .
" posh and becks was the start of the celebrity age and since then it has moved on to people like jade goody , who was the most read story on the bbc website two days running . "
frith says : " editors have to decide which stories will engage their readers and they will not mourn for stories that they have not got room for . "
a spokesman for the daily telegraph told the bbc : " our aim is to provide up-to-date , reliable news and comment for our readers from a range of voices .
we believe we have been successful in that , including appealing to changing audiences , which is why we remain the market-leading news provider . "
professor justin lewis , head of the school of journalism , media and cultural studies at cardiff university , has conducted research on the changing content of newspapers .
he says : " there is no doubt that celebrity news as a category has grown markedly , especially in broadcasting .
" there is a perception that that is what people want but there is not actually that much evidence that it is .
people may say it sells newspapers , but clearly it does n't because circulation is still going down . "
but he adds : " i do n't think there is a shortage of crime coverage , but it 's just a different type .
big newsworthy crimes still get covered rather than the day-to-day business of the courts . "
tv to blame ?
jeff edwards , who was the mirror 's crime correspondent until being made redundant last year , agrees : " i do n't think crime reporting is dead .
there is not a huge dropping off in interest in law enforcement .
but there is a dropping off in stories about ordinary people . "
professor franklin says there is no doubt the courts are not covered like they used to be , but he says there is still a big demand from the public for crime stories , especially " cause celebres " like the cases of madeline mccann and shannon matthews .
campbell says : " newspapers do n't want to run lengthy court reports .
we are playing up to an attention deficit disorder .
there is a feeling that people ca n't take large chunks of information , whether it 's on radio , on television or in newspapers . "
fleet street has changed out of all recognition since the 1970s he pins part of the blame on tv .
" the concept of rolling news , where the competition is not to explain something better but to have a version up quicker .
speed , rather than depth , has become the essence , " he says .
" decent court reporting is also very people-intensive .
sometimes you may have to hang around for a few days without getting anything in the paper , but you bump into lawyers , police officers , even defendants and somebody tells you something and you get a story emerging . "
campbell 's latest novel is a " requiem for the old days of crime reporting " and focuses on an old bailey reporter struggling with a celebrity-obsessed newsdesk .
he sees the same trends in local newspapers , where cut-backs have meant it is extremely rare to see journalists at most magistrates ' and even crown courts .
but one place where crime reporting thrives is scotland , where tabloid papers regularly lead with tales of organised crime .
the editor of the sunday mail , allan rennie , says : " i do n't know if it 's because scots like crime stories or whether organised crime is more visible up here , more like old-fashioned criminals like the krays . "
rennie adds : " nowadays it 's a fact of life that you ca n't afford to send staff to spend days on end at court . "
he thinks one possible answer would be to allow television cameras inside courts .
changing media the media has changed enormously since the 1970s .
in duncan campbell 's book a court reporter battles with his newsdesk reporters are now equipped with mobile phones , laptops , blackberrys and digital cameras and can file copy much quicker than in the old days .
the general public are often invited to become " citizen journalists " by e-mailing or texting in photographs or reportage of incidents they have witnessed , including pictures of celebs doing embarrassing or even mundane things .
but citizen journalists can not cover court cases - they are not trained in the legal pitfalls and are unlikely to have any shorthand skills - so the criminal justice system goes under-reported .
who cares ?
but does it matter ?
professor lewis says : " the danger is that it potentially distorts our perception of crime . "
st george says there is another danger .
" princes and paupers and politicians can get away with murder if there is nobody on the press bench to report it , " he says .
" and if an accused wants to declare their innocence to the world who is there to report it ? "
campbell says : " who knows how many scandals we have missed ?
people might have got away with a lot of stuff because there are far less investigative journalists going out and actually covering things .
it 's far easier to shove a celebrity picture on a page rather than go out and find a story . "
but he is hopeful for the future .
he says : " there may be a reaction to the trivialisation of the news , to the spin and the vitriol , in ways i ca n't predict .
we are in a period of enormous change and people may want to know about stories in far greater detail . "
if it bleeds , by duncan campbell , is due out this week .
your comments : " news coverage " has all but disappeared .
to be replaced by , -lsb- the infinitely more profitable - so we are told -rsb- , sensationalism , speculation and conjecture of today 's " news stories " .
chris neame , bodrum , turkey i have stopped buying daily newspapers as all the tabloids have simply turned into celebrity gossip magazines and i have no interest in that .
i still get a weekend broadsheet but even then news is pretty thin on the ground .
a sad state of affairs .
vince , hertfordshire , uk the biggest change i 've noticed in news coverage over the past 20 years is that i do n't buy newspapers any more .
i used to buy a morning and evening paper , as did my husband , but now it is very rare .
maybe if i 'm going on a long train journey i 'll invest in one -lrb- mainly for the puzzles page -rrb- but they always seem to be full of the same old rehashed stories and features .
recently i 've taken to picking up a book instead .
jane , southampton , uk i have noticed a great change in the past 10 years and even the past 20 years .
the writing is more simple , and the subject " here today , gone tomorrow " .
i think it 's very sad that the media has moved its position to one of entertainment rather than news .
that probably explains why younger people do n't have a clue who the people are who govern their lives and only aspire to be like the latest pop sensation .
michael hunter , stourbridge , uk indeed there seems a bit less crime coverage but this is a very good thing !
excessive journalistic coverage of crime has contributed to a widespread belief that crime is rising even when it is actually falling , with tragic social consequences for us all .
w , blakesley , uk although there has been a reduction in crime stories we still have a vast number of fear-generating news stories .
knife crime is a prime example of this phenomenon with the tabloids creating the impression that down every dark alley in london a knife wielding criminal is lurking .
l. freeman , london i buy a newspaper every day mainly for the showbiz gossip .
i think a newspaper should be seen as an entertainment forum as well as providing real news .
the simple truth is that showbiz stories sell more newspapers than typical crime stories and that is probably why there are now so many more weekly showbiz magazines filling up newsagents ' shelves .

" in those days pa -lsb- the press association -rsb- had seven people covering the old bailey , and the express , mail and the times all had staffers down here . "
pa now has two hard-working but over-stretched journalists covering the old bailey and supplying copy to the national newspapers , who long ago withdrew their court reporters back to their offices .
the other day there was a fellow jailed for 30 years for shooting at a policeman .
that would have been a big story a few years ago , but nowadays it does n't even merit a mention dave st george st george says : " i used to get four or five stories in the telegraph every day .
now i never hear from the newsdesks from one year to the next .
they 're filling the papers with all this other stuff .
" the other day there was a fellow jailed for 30 years for shooting at a policeman .
that would have been a big story a few years ago , but nowadays it does n't even merit a mention , " st george says .
the case of carlton sam only merited three paragraphs in the sun and one paragraph in the mirror .
no other national newspaper reported it .
ironically the reduction in coverage coincides with a rise in the number of crimes .
" in the 1970s if we had one homicide a fortnight it was big news , " st george says .
this week there are 11 ongoing murder trials at the old bailey .
so have readers just had their fill of crime ?
would they rather read about the new mansion ronaldo has bought or discover why an eastenders actress has split up with her boyfriend ?
carlton sam , who shot at police , barely merited a mention yes , says mark frith , former editor of heat magazine and author of the celeb diaries .
" there was an untapped market and the whole -lsb- princess -rsb- diana phenomenon showed that people wanted to read about people in the public eye , " he says .
" posh and becks was the start of the celebrity age and since then it has moved on to people like jade goody , who was the most read story on the bbc website two days running . "
frith says : " editors have to decide which stories will engage their readers and they will not mourn for stories that they have not got room for . "
a spokesman for the daily telegraph told the bbc : " our aim is to provide up-to-date , reliable news and comment for our readers from a range of voices .
we believe we have been successful in that , including appealing to changing audiences , which is why we remain the market-leading news provider . "
professor justin lewis , head of the school of journalism , media and cultural studies at cardiff university , has conducted research on the changing content of newspapers .
he says : " there is no doubt that celebrity news as a category has grown markedly , especially in broadcasting .
" there is a perception that that is what people want but there is not actually that much evidence that it is .
people may say it sells newspapers , but clearly it does n't because circulation is still going down . "
but he adds : " i do n't think there is a shortage of crime coverage , but it 's just a different type .
big newsworthy crimes still get covered rather than the day-to-day business of the courts . "
tv to blame ?
jeff edwards , who was the mirror 's crime correspondent until being made redundant last year , agrees : " i do n't think crime reporting is dead .
there is not a huge dropping off in interest in law enforcement .
but there is a dropping off in stories about ordinary people . "
professor franklin says there is no doubt the courts are not covered like they used to be , but he says there is still a big demand from the public for crime stories , especially " cause celebres " like the cases of madeline mccann and shannon matthews .
campbell says : " newspapers do n't want to run lengthy court reports .
we are playing up to an attention deficit disorder .
there is a feeling that people ca n't take large chunks of information , whether it 's on radio , on television or in newspapers . "
fleet street has changed out of all recognition since the 1970s he pins part of the blame on tv .
" the concept of rolling news , where the competition is not to explain something better but to have a version up quicker .
speed , rather than depth , has become the essence , " he says .
" decent court reporting is also very people-intensive .
sometimes you may have to hang around for a few days without getting anything in the paper , but you bump into lawyers , police officers , even defendants and somebody tells you something and you get a story emerging . "
campbell 's latest novel is a " requiem for the old days of crime reporting " and focuses on an old bailey reporter struggling with a celebrity-obsessed newsdesk .
he sees the same trends in local newspapers , where cut-backs have meant it is extremely rare to see journalists at most magistrates ' and even crown courts .
but one place where crime reporting thrives is scotland , where tabloid papers regularly lead with tales of organised crime .
the editor of the sunday mail , allan rennie , says : " i do n't know if it 's because scots like crime stories or whether organised crime is more visible up here , more like old-fashioned criminals like the krays . "
rennie adds : " nowadays it 's a fact of life that you ca n't afford to send staff to spend days on end at court . "
he thinks one possible answer would be to allow television cameras inside courts .
changing media the media has changed enormously since the 1970s .
in duncan campbell 's book a court reporter battles with his newsdesk reporters are now equipped with mobile phones , laptops , blackberrys and digital cameras and can file copy much quicker than in the old days .
the general public are often invited to become " citizen journalists " by e-mailing or texting in photographs or reportage of incidents they have witnessed , including pictures of celebs doing embarrassing or even mundane things .
but citizen journalists can not cover court cases - they are not trained in the legal pitfalls and are unlikely to have any shorthand skills - so the criminal justice system goes under-reported .
who cares ?
but does it matter ?
professor lewis says : " the danger is that it potentially distorts our perception of crime . "
st george says there is another danger .
" princes and paupers and politicians can get away with murder if there is nobody on the press bench to report it , " he says .
" and if an accused wants to declare their innocence to the world who is there to report it ? "
campbell says : " who knows how many scandals we have missed ?
people might have got away with a lot of stuff because there are far less investigative journalists going out and actually covering things .
it 's far easier to shove a celebrity picture on a page rather than go out and find a story . "
but he is hopeful for the future .
he says : " there may be a reaction to the trivialisation of the news , to the spin and the vitriol , in ways i ca n't predict .
we are in a period of enormous change and people may want to know about stories in far greater detail . "
if it bleeds , by duncan campbell , is due out this week .
your comments : " news coverage " has all but disappeared .
to be replaced by , -lsb- the infinitely more profitable - so we are told -rsb- , sensationalism , speculation and conjecture of today 's " news stories " .
chris neame , bodrum , turkey i have stopped buying daily newspapers as all the tabloids have simply turned into celebrity gossip magazines and i have no interest in that .
i still get a weekend broadsheet but even then news is pretty thin on the ground .
a sad state of affairs .
vince , hertfordshire , uk the biggest change i 've noticed in news coverage over the past 20 years is that i do n't buy newspapers any more .
i used to buy a morning and evening paper , as did my husband , but now it is very rare .
maybe if i 'm going on a long train journey i 'll invest in one -lrb- mainly for the puzzles page -rrb- but they always seem to be full of the same old rehashed stories and features .
recently i 've taken to picking up a book instead .
jane , southampton , uk i have noticed a great change in the past 10 years and even the past 20 years .
the writing is more simple , and the subject " here today , gone tomorrow " .
i think it 's very sad that the media has moved its position to one of entertainment rather than news .
that probably explains why younger people do n't have a clue who the people are who govern their lives and only aspire to be like the latest pop sensation .
michael hunter , stourbridge , uk indeed there seems a bit less crime coverage but this is a very good thing !
excessive journalistic coverage of crime has contributed to a widespread belief that crime is rising even when it is actually falling , with tragic social consequences for us all .
w , blakesley , uk although there has been a reduction in crime stories we still have a vast number of fear-generating news stories .
knife crime is a prime example of this phenomenon with the tabloids creating the impression that down every dark alley in london a knife wielding criminal is lurking .
l. freeman , london i buy a newspaper every day mainly for the showbiz gossip .
i think a newspaper should be seen as an entertainment forum as well as providing real news .
the simple truth is that showbiz stories sell more newspapers than typical crime stories and that is probably why there are now so many more weekly showbiz magazines filling up newsagents ' shelves .

celebrity gossip has forced out a lot of hard news in modern newspapers believe it or not , once upon a time , newspapers and television news bulletins were full of actual news involving actual people , much of it generated by reporters on the crime beat .
the demise of the crime reporter , and the decline of investigative journalism in general , has coincided almost perfectly during the past 20 years with the rise of celebrity news .
tittle-tattle about soap stars , premier league footballers , tv chefs and even those who " starred " in shows like big brother now makes up the bulk of tabloid newspaper content , and it has seeped inevitably into upmarket papers and tv news and current affairs programmes .
this is a world in which the first photograph of tv presenter davina mccall , pregnant , walking down the street , was sold to a newspaper for £ 7,500 .
death of fleet street other factors have no doubt played a part - the rise of public relations -lrb- pr -rrb- and press officers and the gradual move away from fleet street by the national newspapers meant the culture of journalists getting out of their offices and chatting to detectives , lawyers , politicians , entrepreneurs and other " sources " over a drink in a pub has ebbed away .
" hard news is declining and there has been a movement towards ' lifestyle journalism ' , often provided by prs or agencies .
it is cheap and fairly easy , " says bob franklin , professor of journalism studies at cardiff university .
he says : " i often wonder why we train our students to cover the courts and council meetings because when they get jobs they rarely have to do either .
journalists do not get out of their offices as much as they used to .
there is a lot more juggling the wires -lsb- news agencies -rsb- and press releases .
newspapers do n't want to run lengthy court reports .
we are playing up to an attention deficit disorder duncan campbell the guardian changing newspapers 1979-2009 " after all , discussing the latest celebrity dress is easier than uncovering corruption on a local council . "
duncan campbell , the guardian 's long-time crime correspondent , who is retiring this year after four decades in journalism , says : " nowadays you get much more homogenous news with all the media chasing the same stories . "
" most newspapers , and the bbc and others , have websites and they can see from the number of hits a story gets what is popular .
" you will find a story about -lsb- cristiano -rsb- ronaldo or kate moss will be massively hit , which you will not necessarily get from an interesting story with nobody famous in it . "
campbell says crime coverage has been one of the biggest casualties , with newspapers and broadcasters massively downsizing their teams .

there is a feeling that people ca n't take large chunks of information , whether it 's on radio , on television or in newspapers . "
fleet street has changed out of all recognition since the 1970s he pins part of the blame on tv .
" the concept of rolling news , where the competition is not to explain something better but to have a version up quicker .
speed , rather than depth , has become the essence , " he says .
" decent court reporting is also very people-intensive .
sometimes you may have to hang around for a few days without getting anything in the paper , but you bump into lawyers , police officers , even defendants and somebody tells you something and you get a story emerging . "
campbell 's latest novel is a " requiem for the old days of crime reporting " and focuses on an old bailey reporter struggling with a celebrity-obsessed newsdesk .
he sees the same trends in local newspapers , where cut-backs have meant it is extremely rare to see journalists at most magistrates ' and even crown courts .
but one place where crime reporting thrives is scotland , where tabloid papers regularly lead with tales of organised crime .
the editor of the sunday mail , allan rennie , says : " i do n't know if it 's because scots like crime stories or whether organised crime is more visible up here , more like old-fashioned criminals like the krays . "
rennie adds : " nowadays it 's a fact of life that you ca n't afford to send staff to spend days on end at court . "
he thinks one possible answer would be to allow television cameras inside courts .
changing media the media has changed enormously since the 1970s .
in duncan campbell 's book a court reporter battles with his newsdesk reporters are now equipped with mobile phones , laptops , blackberrys and digital cameras and can file copy much quicker than in the old days .
the general public are often invited to become " citizen journalists " by e-mailing or texting in photographs or reportage of incidents they have witnessed , including pictures of celebs doing embarrassing or even mundane things .
but citizen journalists can not cover court cases - they are not trained in the legal pitfalls and are unlikely to have any shorthand skills - so the criminal justice system goes under-reported .
who cares ?
but does it matter ?
professor lewis says : " the danger is that it potentially distorts our perception of crime . "
st george says there is another danger .
" princes and paupers and politicians can get away with murder if there is nobody on the press bench to report it , " he says .
" and if an accused wants to declare their innocence to the world who is there to report it ? "
campbell says : " who knows how many scandals we have missed ?
people might have got away with a lot of stuff because there are far less investigative journalists going out and actually covering things .
it 's far easier to shove a celebrity picture on a page rather than go out and find a story . "
but he is hopeful for the future .
he says : " there may be a reaction to the trivialisation of the news , to the spin and the vitriol , in ways i ca n't predict .
we are in a period of enormous change and people may want to know about stories in far greater detail . "

celebrity gossip has forced out a lot of hard news in modern newspapers believe it or not , once upon a time , newspapers and television news bulletins were full of actual news involving actual people , much of it generated by reporters on the crime beat .
the demise of the crime reporter , and the decline of investigative journalism in general , has coincided almost perfectly during the past 20 years with the rise of celebrity news .
tittle-tattle about soap stars , premier league footballers , tv chefs and even those who " starred " in shows like big brother now makes up the bulk of tabloid newspaper content , and it has seeped inevitably into upmarket papers and tv news and current affairs programmes .
this is a world in which the first photograph of tv presenter davina mccall , pregnant , walking down the street , was sold to a newspaper for £ 7,500 .
death of fleet street other factors have no doubt played a part - the rise of public relations -lrb- pr -rrb- and press officers and the gradual move away from fleet street by the national newspapers meant the culture of journalists getting out of their offices and chatting to detectives , lawyers , politicians , entrepreneurs and other " sources " over a drink in a pub has ebbed away .
" hard news is declining and there has been a movement towards ' lifestyle journalism ' , often provided by prs or agencies .
it is cheap and fairly easy , " says bob franklin , professor of journalism studies at cardiff university .
he says : " i often wonder why we train our students to cover the courts and council meetings because when they get jobs they rarely have to do either .
journalists do not get out of their offices as much as they used to .
there is a lot more juggling the wires -lsb- news agencies -rsb- and press releases .
newspapers do n't want to run lengthy court reports .
we are playing up to an attention deficit disorder duncan campbell the guardian changing newspapers 1979-2009 " after all , discussing the latest celebrity dress is easier than uncovering corruption on a local council . "
duncan campbell , the guardian 's long-time crime correspondent , who is retiring this year after four decades in journalism , says : " nowadays you get much more homogenous news with all the media chasing the same stories . "
" most newspapers , and the bbc and others , have websites and they can see from the number of hits a story gets what is popular .
" you will find a story about -lsb- cristiano -rsb- ronaldo or kate moss will be massively hit , which you will not necessarily get from an interesting story with nobody famous in it . "
campbell says crime coverage has been one of the biggest casualties , with newspapers and broadcasters massively downsizing their teams .
retreat of the reporters old bailey reporter dave st george can vouch for that .
" i started here in 1969 when i was asked to supply the telegraph , mirror and the standard , " he says .
" in those days pa -lsb- the press association -rsb- had seven people covering the old bailey , and the express , mail and the times all had staffers down here . "
pa now has two hard-working but over-stretched journalists covering the old bailey and supplying copy to the national newspapers , who long ago withdrew their court reporters back to their offices .
the other day there was a fellow jailed for 30 years for shooting at a policeman .
that would have been a big story a few years ago , but nowadays it does n't even merit a mention dave st george st george says : " i used to get four or five stories in the telegraph every day .
now i never hear from the newsdesks from one year to the next .
they 're filling the papers with all this other stuff .
" the other day there was a fellow jailed for 30 years for shooting at a policeman .
that would have been a big story a few years ago , but nowadays it does n't even merit a mention , " st george says .
the case of carlton sam only merited three paragraphs in the sun and one paragraph in the mirror .
no other national newspaper reported it .
ironically the reduction in coverage coincides with a rise in the number of crimes .
" in the 1970s if we had one homicide a fortnight it was big news , " st george says .
this week there are 11 ongoing murder trials at the old bailey .
so have readers just had their fill of crime ?
would they rather read about the new mansion ronaldo has bought or discover why an eastenders actress has split up with her boyfriend ?
carlton sam , who shot at police , barely merited a mention yes , says mark frith , former editor of heat magazine and author of the celeb diaries .
" there was an untapped market and the whole -lsb- princess -rsb- diana phenomenon showed that people wanted to read about people in the public eye , " he says .
" posh and becks was the start of the celebrity age and since then it has moved on to people like jade goody , who was the most read story on the bbc website two days running . "
frith says : " editors have to decide which stories will engage their readers and they will not mourn for stories that they have not got room for . "
a spokesman for the daily telegraph told the bbc : " our aim is to provide up-to-date , reliable news and comment for our readers from a range of voices .
we believe we have been successful in that , including appealing to changing audiences , which is why we remain the market-leading news provider . "
professor justin lewis , head of the school of journalism , media and cultural studies at cardiff university , has conducted research on the changing content of newspapers .
he says : " there is no doubt that celebrity news as a category has grown markedly , especially in broadcasting .
" there is a perception that that is what people want but there is not actually that much evidence that it is .
people may say it sells newspapers , but clearly it does n't because circulation is still going down . "
but he adds : " i do n't think there is a shortage of crime coverage , but it 's just a different type .
big newsworthy crimes still get covered rather than the day-to-day business of the courts . "
tv to blame ?
jeff edwards , who was the mirror 's crime correspondent until being made redundant last year , agrees : " i do n't think crime reporting is dead .
there is not a huge dropping off in interest in law enforcement .
but there is a dropping off in stories about ordinary people . "
professor franklin says there is no doubt the courts are not covered like they used to be , but he says there is still a big demand from the public for crime stories , especially " cause celebres " like the cases of madeline mccann and shannon matthews .
campbell says : " newspapers do n't want to run lengthy court reports .
we are playing up to an attention deficit disorder .
there is a feeling that people ca n't take large chunks of information , whether it 's on radio , on television or in newspapers . "

celebrity gossip has forced out a lot of hard news in modern newspapers believe it or not , once upon a time , newspapers and television news bulletins were full of actual news involving actual people , much of it generated by reporters on the crime beat .
the demise of the crime reporter , and the decline of investigative journalism in general , has coincided almost perfectly during the past 20 years with the rise of celebrity news .
tittle-tattle about soap stars , premier league footballers , tv chefs and even those who " starred " in shows like big brother now makes up the bulk of tabloid newspaper content , and it has seeped inevitably into upmarket papers and tv news and current affairs programmes .
this is a world in which the first photograph of tv presenter davina mccall , pregnant , walking down the street , was sold to a newspaper for £ 7,500 .
death of fleet street other factors have no doubt played a part - the rise of public relations -lrb- pr -rrb- and press officers and the gradual move away from fleet street by the national newspapers meant the culture of journalists getting out of their offices and chatting to detectives , lawyers , politicians , entrepreneurs and other " sources " over a drink in a pub has ebbed away .
" hard news is declining and there has been a movement towards ' lifestyle journalism ' , often provided by prs or agencies .
it is cheap and fairly easy , " says bob franklin , professor of journalism studies at cardiff university .
he says : " i often wonder why we train our students to cover the courts and council meetings because when they get jobs they rarely have to do either .
journalists do not get out of their offices as much as they used to .
there is a lot more juggling the wires -lsb- news agencies -rsb- and press releases .
newspapers do n't want to run lengthy court reports .
we are playing up to an attention deficit disorder duncan campbell the guardian changing newspapers 1979-2009 " after all , discussing the latest celebrity dress is easier than uncovering corruption on a local council . "
duncan campbell , the guardian 's long-time crime correspondent , who is retiring this year after four decades in journalism , says : " nowadays you get much more homogenous news with all the media chasing the same stories . "
" most newspapers , and the bbc and others , have websites and they can see from the number of hits a story gets what is popular .
" you will find a story about -lsb- cristiano -rsb- ronaldo or kate moss will be massively hit , which you will not necessarily get from an interesting story with nobody famous in it . "
campbell says crime coverage has been one of the biggest casualties , with newspapers and broadcasters massively downsizing their teams .
retreat of the reporters old bailey reporter dave st george can vouch for that .
" i started here in 1969 when i was asked to supply the telegraph , mirror and the standard , " he says .
" in those days pa -lsb- the press association -rsb- had seven people covering the old bailey , and the express , mail and the times all had staffers down here . "
pa now has two hard-working but over-stretched journalists covering the old bailey and supplying copy to the national newspapers , who long ago withdrew their court reporters back to their offices .
the other day there was a fellow jailed for 30 years for shooting at a policeman .
that would have been a big story a few years ago , but nowadays it does n't even merit a mention dave st george st george says : " i used to get four or five stories in the telegraph every day .
now i never hear from the newsdesks from one year to the next .
they 're filling the papers with all this other stuff .
" the other day there was a fellow jailed for 30 years for shooting at a policeman .
that would have been a big story a few years ago , but nowadays it does n't even merit a mention , " st george says .
the case of carlton sam only merited three paragraphs in the sun and one paragraph in the mirror .
no other national newspaper reported it .
ironically the reduction in coverage coincides with a rise in the number of crimes .
" in the 1970s if we had one homicide a fortnight it was big news , " st george says .
this week there are 11 ongoing murder trials at the old bailey .
so have readers just had their fill of crime ?
would they rather read about the new mansion ronaldo has bought or discover why an eastenders actress has split up with her boyfriend ?
carlton sam , who shot at police , barely merited a mention yes , says mark frith , former editor of heat magazine and author of the celeb diaries .
" there was an untapped market and the whole -lsb- princess -rsb- diana phenomenon showed that people wanted to read about people in the public eye , " he says .
" posh and becks was the start of the celebrity age and since then it has moved on to people like jade goody , who was the most read story on the bbc website two days running . "
frith says : " editors have to decide which stories will engage their readers and they will not mourn for stories that they have not got room for . "
a spokesman for the daily telegraph told the bbc : " our aim is to provide up-to-date , reliable news and comment for our readers from a range of voices .
we believe we have been successful in that , including appealing to changing audiences , which is why we remain the market-leading news provider . "
professor justin lewis , head of the school of journalism , media and cultural studies at cardiff university , has conducted research on the changing content of newspapers .
he says : " there is no doubt that celebrity news as a category has grown markedly , especially in broadcasting .
" there is a perception that that is what people want but there is not actually that much evidence that it is .
people may say it sells newspapers , but clearly it does n't because circulation is still going down . "
but he adds : " i do n't think there is a shortage of crime coverage , but it 's just a different type .
big newsworthy crimes still get covered rather than the day-to-day business of the courts . "
tv to blame ?
jeff edwards , who was the mirror 's crime correspondent until being made redundant last year , agrees : " i do n't think crime reporting is dead .
there is not a huge dropping off in interest in law enforcement .
but there is a dropping off in stories about ordinary people . "
professor franklin says there is no doubt the courts are not covered like they used to be , but he says there is still a big demand from the public for crime stories , especially " cause celebres " like the cases of madeline mccann and shannon matthews .
campbell says : " newspapers do n't want to run lengthy court reports .
we are playing up to an attention deficit disorder .
there is a feeling that people ca n't take large chunks of information , whether it 's on radio , on television or in newspapers . "
fleet street has changed out of all recognition since the 1970s he pins part of the blame on tv .
" the concept of rolling news , where the competition is not to explain something better but to have a version up quicker .
speed , rather than depth , has become the essence , " he says .
" decent court reporting is also very people-intensive .
sometimes you may have to hang around for a few days without getting anything in the paper , but you bump into lawyers , police officers , even defendants and somebody tells you something and you get a story emerging . "
campbell 's latest novel is a " requiem for the old days of crime reporting " and focuses on an old bailey reporter struggling with a celebrity-obsessed newsdesk .
he sees the same trends in local newspapers , where cut-backs have meant it is extremely rare to see journalists at most magistrates ' and even crown courts .
but one place where crime reporting thrives is scotland , where tabloid papers regularly lead with tales of organised crime .
the editor of the sunday mail , allan rennie , says : " i do n't know if it 's because scots like crime stories or whether organised crime is more visible up here , more like old-fashioned criminals like the krays . "
rennie adds : " nowadays it 's a fact of life that you ca n't afford to send staff to spend days on end at court . "
he thinks one possible answer would be to allow television cameras inside courts .
changing media the media has changed enormously since the 1970s .
in duncan campbell 's book a court reporter battles with his newsdesk reporters are now equipped with mobile phones , laptops , blackberrys and digital cameras and can file copy much quicker than in the old days .
the general public are often invited to become " citizen journalists " by e-mailing or texting in photographs or reportage of incidents they have witnessed , including pictures of celebs doing embarrassing or even mundane things .
but citizen journalists can not cover court cases - they are not trained in the legal pitfalls and are unlikely to have any shorthand skills - so the criminal justice system goes under-reported .
who cares ?
but does it matter ?
professor lewis says : " the danger is that it potentially distorts our perception of crime . "
st george says there is another danger .
" princes and paupers and politicians can get away with murder if there is nobody on the press bench to report it , " he says .
" and if an accused wants to declare their innocence to the world who is there to report it ? "
campbell says : " who knows how many scandals we have missed ?
people might have got away with a lot of stuff because there are far less investigative journalists going out and actually covering things .
it 's far easier to shove a celebrity picture on a page rather than go out and find a story . "
but he is hopeful for the future .
he says : " there may be a reaction to the trivialisation of the news , to the spin and the vitriol , in ways i ca n't predict .
we are in a period of enormous change and people may want to know about stories in far greater detail . "
if it bleeds , by duncan campbell , is due out this week .
your comments : " news coverage " has all but disappeared .
to be replaced by , -lsb- the infinitely more profitable - so we are told -rsb- , sensationalism , speculation and conjecture of today 's " news stories " .
chris neame , bodrum , turkey i have stopped buying daily newspapers as all the tabloids have simply turned into celebrity gossip magazines and i have no interest in that .
i still get a weekend broadsheet but even then news is pretty thin on the ground .
a sad state of affairs .

here we compare four papers .
the sun between 1979 and 2009 daily mail between 1979 and 2009 daily telegraph between 1979 and 2009 the guardian between 1979 and 2009 the sun 15 january 1979 front-page headline - helpless ! 3 million face dole queues britain was in the grip of the " winter of discontent " .
at the time many people still worked in the manufacturing industries and many of them faced lay-offs due to shortages caused by strikes by both lorry drivers and rail workers .
has crime lost out to showbiz ?
sun circulation figures jan-jul 1979 - 3,793,007 jan-jul 1989 - 4,173,267 jan-jul 1999 - 3,730,466 jan 2009 - 3,146,006 source : audited bureau of circulations -lrb- abc -rrb- page three girls had been introduced in 1970 , but the political and industrial crisis was so dire " lovely tina thomas " was actually relegated to page five .
because of a crippling lack of newsprint , the whole paper was reduced to a measly 12 pages , three of which were sport .
prominent stories involved the unsolved murder of model barbara gaul in brighton , and campaigner mary whitehouse was criticising the bbc for showing sexually explicit films on bbc two .
the sun had recently overtaken the daily mirror to become britain 's most popular newspaper .
16 january 1989 -lrb- 15 january was a sunday -rrb- front-page headline - tv boss in porn girls quiz only 10 years have elapsed but already the sun is showing signs of change .
next to the main story on the front page is a huge plug for a feature inside about eastenders star leslie grantham , entitled the secret life of dirty den .
the page-seven lead is about a woman who had won money in the sun 's own bingo competition .
also prominent is the new bizarre column , about showbiz gossip , which was edited at the time by garry bushell .
15 january 1999 front-page headline - jagger divorce the sun claims a world exclusive in revealing that rolling stones singer mick jagger was splitting up with his wife , the model and actress jerry hall .
the paper was now up to a " whopping " 60 pages , with 11 pages devoted to sport .
the trend towards celebrity culture is even more marked , with several leads about tv stars and footballers - including the " news " that manchester united 's gary neville had bought a bicycle .
there was also a two-page spread about celebrities and their daughters , featuring madonna , sheryl gascoigne and jerry hall again ; and also a 24-page entertainment listings supplement .
dominic mohan has taken over the bizarre column , which is now spread over two pages .
15 january 2009 front-page headline - life on mars -lrb- well , there 's something up there has wind -rrb- quite unusually the editor has chosen to " splash " on a serious story - albeit riddled with puns - about nasa revealing that methane has been detected on the red planet , which could hint at the existence of some form of life .
the page three girl survives - despite several campaigns by the politically correct to remove her - in the form of 21-year-old peta from essex .
there are numerous page leads about celebrities , including one which claims a tv money expert has gone bankrupt .
page seven is devoted to a large picture spread about victoria beckham advertising armani underwear , which appears to be based on solely a press release .
another example of pr blurb is a story - illustrated with several pictures - of a " magic scarf " that is apparently proving popular with female shoppers .
the daily mail back to top 15 january 1979 front-page headline - now - bonny alastair linda lee-potter , who later made her name as a columnist , penned this front-page story about the birth of the world 's second test-tube baby .
daily mail circulation jan - jul 1979 - 1,943,793 jan - jul 1989 - 1,750,303 jan - jul 1999 - 2,350,241 jan 2009 - 2,228,897 source : abc nigel dempster 's gossip column was prominent on page seven and page leads included news of film star john wayne 's nine-hour stomach operation .
he would die of cancer six months later .
another page lead was a first-person piece of reportage by john edwards , who was one of the journalists who had discovered the secrets of what would be known as the " killing fields " following the khmer rouge 's departure from cambodia .
16 january 1989 front-page headline - fergie back on death slopes the duchess of york , popular tabloid fodder throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s , was on a skiing holiday in klosters not long after an avalanche which had killed a former royal equerry .
page leads include a picture spread on boxer frank bruno 's six-year-old daughter , stories about japanese pow camps which is linked to the tv drama tenko .
there is also a two-page spread , illustrated with lurid photographs , about south africa 's far-right awb movement , its leader eugene terreblanche and sex scandals involving a woman called jani allen .
by now nigel dempster had been relegated to page 17 .
15 january 1999 front-page headline - you can keep the children for now the lead story was about foster parents jeff and jenny bramley who went missing with two little girls in their care after a row with social services .
later that year charges of abduction were dropped against the couple .
elsewhere there are regular daily mail themes , including bashing of the european union , and a feature about nurses quitting the nhs .
the page-five lead is all about rod stewart 's then wife rachel hunter .
in the inside pages is a two-page spread about stars like jennifer aniston looking hungover .
in the 1990s the mail bucked the trend for declining circulation and opened up a huge gap on its one-time rival , the struggling and under-funded daily express .
poor old dempster has by now been shunted on to page 39 , and was eventually dropped altogether in 2003 .
15 january 2009 front-page headline - minister shoots herself in the foot the mail goes to town on the story about junior government minister baroness vadera claiming she could see the " green shoots " of economic recovery amid the general doom and gloom .
the paper also took aim at the bbc on the front page for allowing disgraced tv presenter jonathan ross to host the bafta awards .
the mail is also prone to pr spin , with a large picture spread on the " magic scarf " on page three , and a page lead on victoria beckham in that armani underwear again .
also noticeable is the rise of the commentator , with several pages given over to opinion columns by stephen glover , ann leslie , quentin letts and keith waterhouse .
femail has grown to a 19-page supplement , including a picture spread about what clothes the women judges wear on the x factor .
the daily telegraph back to top 15 january 1979 front-page headline - cabinet face tory fury daily telegraph circulation jan - jul 1979 - 1,476,887 jan - jul 1989 - 1,113,033 jan - jul 1999 - 1,044,740 jan 2009 - 842,912 source - abc the telegraph openly gloats as jim callaghan 's labour government struggles amid a tide of industrial strife .
home secretary merlyn rees orders an inquiry into the use of secondary picketing by the tgwu .
the broadsheet front page is stolidly conservative , with a combination of political and foreign stories and not a whiff of celebrity in sight .
the main photo is of chinese peasants protesting in what was then known as peking .
inside , the paper contains large amounts of foreign news , including a page-four lead about muslim rebels killing 100 troops of the afghan communist government .
eleven months later the soviet union invaded to support the kabul regime .
several columnists put the boot into the government and the trade unions , with one describing strikes as " britain 's disease " .
the paper is only 16 pages , due to a shortage of newsprint .
16 january 1989 front-page headline - israel hits back at waldegrave ' insults ' junior foreign office minister william waldegrave has got himself into trouble with the israeli government for telling them not to be " clever silly " in their dealings with the palestinians and referring to then prime minister yitzhak shamir 's past in the " terrorist " stern gang .
there is also a front-page picture of salman rushdie 's controversial book the satanic verses being burned in bradford .
the paper wears its thatcherite heart on its sleeve with page leads on plans being considered by the tory government for identity cards and the possibility of all immigrants being dna tested .
george walden pens a column about the dangers of the end of the cold war , including the rise of islam .
15 january 1999 front-page headline -lrb- under a huge picture of president bill clinton -rrb- - ' his lies were not few or isolated but pervaded his whole testimony ' the presidential impeachment hearing dominated the paper , with pages four and five totally taken up by it .
other stories on the inside pages include a man who survived for 22 days lost in the jungles of papua new guinea , an interview with a british hostage freed in yemen , and the ex-boyfriend of gynaecologist dr joan francisco being charged with her murder .
he was later jailed for life .
the paper looks a lot more colourful and better presented than in the 1970s and 1980s but remains full of hard news with little bowing to the growing celebrity culture .
15 january 2009 front-page headline - dismay as minister ' sees the shoots of recovery ' the paper still sometimes dubbed the torygraph tears into baroness vadera for her controversial comments in an interview with itv news .
the front-page picture is a large photograph of the musical oliver , ahead of a story about it having taken advance sales of £ 15m , which sounds very much like it has come from the theatre 's pr company .
there is much less foreign news than in the past and scant crime coverage .
again the pr companies are doing well with the magic scarf story making a large picture spread on page four and a survey by a retail analysis firm making a page lead about john lewis being britain 's most popular shop .
there is also a page lead about a new drug for eyelashes that does away with the need for mascara and , on an inside page , a large article which plugging a new book and dvd on johnny cash .
the guardian back to top 15 january 1979 front-page headline - road and rail strikes put 1m jobs at risk the labour-supporting paper is clearly embarrassed by the growing " winter of discontent " and offers a lower figure for the number of jobs at risk because of the haulage dispute .
the newsprint shortage means the guardian is down to 12 pages .
inside the paper looks dowdy and dull , with lots of coverage of the arts and features on social work and other liberal professions .
16 january 1989 front page headline - freedom protest crushed the splash is about czechoslovak riot police attacking anti-communist demonstrators commemorating the death , by suicide , of protester jan palach in prague in 1959 .
the front page also contains a large black and white photograph of a train crash in bangladesh that claimed many lives .
inside , politics and foreign news dominate , but there is a large article about the 20th anniversary of buddhism coming to britain .
15 january 1999 front-page headline - trial of the century begins guardian circulation jan - jul 1979 - 379,429 jan - jul 1989 - 438,732 jan - jul 1999 - 398,721 jan 2009 - 358,844 source - abc the guardian also leads with the clinton impeachment hearing , with perhaps slightly less relish than the telegraph .
there is a large front-page picture of nelson mandela and fw de klerk with a story suggesting a bitter feud had gone on between the two men behind the scenes .
the story about foster parents jeff and jenny bramley was on page two , probably being of great interest to the paper 's large readership among social workers .
the papua new guinea jungle rescue story and the freeing of the yemen hostage are also page leads .
the review has a large feature about kate winslet .
15 january 2009 front-page headline - ' war on terror was a mistake ' , says miliband during a tour of india foreign secretary david miliband let slip that the whole tone of the bush / blair " war on terror " had been misconceived .
there is also a large picture of the russian tycoon alexander lebedev , who is buying the evening standard .
the guardian shows it too is prone to increasing triviality with page leads on jonathan ross hosting the baftas , the demolition of the astoria venue in london and a story about what presents the royal family received from abroad , which appears to have emanated from a press release .

because of a crippling lack of newsprint , the whole paper was reduced to a measly 12 pages , three of which were sport .
prominent stories involved the unsolved murder of model barbara gaul in brighton , and campaigner mary whitehouse was criticising the bbc for showing sexually explicit films on bbc two .
the sun had recently overtaken the daily mirror to become britain 's most popular newspaper .
16 january 1989 -lrb- 15 january was a sunday -rrb- front-page headline - tv boss in porn girls quiz only 10 years have elapsed but already the sun is showing signs of change .
next to the main story on the front page is a huge plug for a feature inside about eastenders star leslie grantham , entitled the secret life of dirty den .
the page-seven lead is about a woman who had won money in the sun 's own bingo competition .
also prominent is the new bizarre column , about showbiz gossip , which was edited at the time by garry bushell .
15 january 1999 front-page headline - jagger divorce the sun claims a world exclusive in revealing that rolling stones singer mick jagger was splitting up with his wife , the model and actress jerry hall .
the paper was now up to a " whopping " 60 pages , with 11 pages devoted to sport .
the trend towards celebrity culture is even more marked , with several leads about tv stars and footballers - including the " news " that manchester united 's gary neville had bought a bicycle .
there was also a two-page spread about celebrities and their daughters , featuring madonna , sheryl gascoigne and jerry hall again ; and also a 24-page entertainment listings supplement .
dominic mohan has taken over the bizarre column , which is now spread over two pages .
15 january 2009 front-page headline - life on mars -lrb- well , there 's something up there has wind -rrb- quite unusually the editor has chosen to " splash " on a serious story - albeit riddled with puns - about nasa revealing that methane has been detected on the red planet , which could hint at the existence of some form of life .
the page three girl survives - despite several campaigns by the politically correct to remove her - in the form of 21-year-old peta from essex .
there are numerous page leads about celebrities , including one which claims a tv money expert has gone bankrupt .
page seven is devoted to a large picture spread about victoria beckham advertising armani underwear , which appears to be based on solely a press release .
another example of pr blurb is a story - illustrated with several pictures - of a " magic scarf " that is apparently proving popular with female shoppers .
the daily mail back to top 15 january 1979 front-page headline - now - bonny alastair linda lee-potter , who later made her name as a columnist , penned this front-page story about the birth of the world 's second test-tube baby .

the page-five lead is all about rod stewart 's then wife rachel hunter .
in the inside pages is a two-page spread about stars like jennifer aniston looking hungover .
in the 1990s the mail bucked the trend for declining circulation and opened up a huge gap on its one-time rival , the struggling and under-funded daily express .
poor old dempster has by now been shunted on to page 39 , and was eventually dropped altogether in 2003 .
15 january 2009 front-page headline - minister shoots herself in the foot the mail goes to town on the story about junior government minister baroness vadera claiming she could see the " green shoots " of economic recovery amid the general doom and gloom .
the paper also took aim at the bbc on the front page for allowing disgraced tv presenter jonathan ross to host the bafta awards .
the mail is also prone to pr spin , with a large picture spread on the " magic scarf " on page three , and a page lead on victoria beckham in that armani underwear again .
also noticeable is the rise of the commentator , with several pages given over to opinion columns by stephen glover , ann leslie , quentin letts and keith waterhouse .
femail has grown to a 19-page supplement , including a picture spread about what clothes the women judges wear on the x factor .
the daily telegraph back to top 15 january 1979 front-page headline - cabinet face tory fury daily telegraph circulation jan - jul 1979 - 1,476,887 jan - jul 1989 - 1,113,033 jan - jul 1999 - 1,044,740 jan 2009 - 842,912 source - abc the telegraph openly gloats as jim callaghan 's labour government struggles amid a tide of industrial strife .

the broadsheet front page is stolidly conservative , with a combination of political and foreign stories and not a whiff of celebrity in sight .
the main photo is of chinese peasants protesting in what was then known as peking .
inside , the paper contains large amounts of foreign news , including a page-four lead about muslim rebels killing 100 troops of the afghan communist government .
eleven months later the soviet union invaded to support the kabul regime .
several columnists put the boot into the government and the trade unions , with one describing strikes as " britain 's disease " .
the paper is only 16 pages , due to a shortage of newsprint .
16 january 1989 front-page headline - israel hits back at waldegrave ' insults ' junior foreign office minister william waldegrave has got himself into trouble with the israeli government for telling them not to be " clever silly " in their dealings with the palestinians and referring to then prime minister yitzhak shamir 's past in the " terrorist " stern gang .
there is also a front-page picture of salman rushdie 's controversial book the satanic verses being burned in bradford .
the paper wears its thatcherite heart on its sleeve with page leads on plans being considered by the tory government for identity cards and the possibility of all immigrants being dna tested .
george walden pens a column about the dangers of the end of the cold war , including the rise of islam .
15 january 1999 front-page headline -lrb- under a huge picture of president bill clinton -rrb- - ' his lies were not few or isolated but pervaded his whole testimony ' the presidential impeachment hearing dominated the paper , with pages four and five totally taken up by it .
other stories on the inside pages include a man who survived for 22 days lost in the jungles of papua new guinea , an interview with a british hostage freed in yemen , and the ex-boyfriend of gynaecologist dr joan francisco being charged with her murder .
he was later jailed for life .
the paper looks a lot more colourful and better presented than in the 1970s and 1980s but remains full of hard news with little bowing to the growing celebrity culture .
15 january 2009 front-page headline - dismay as minister ' sees the shoots of recovery ' the paper still sometimes dubbed the torygraph tears into baroness vadera for her controversial comments in an interview with itv news .
it makes a nice picture spread , but is it news ?
the front-page picture is a large photograph of the musical oliver , ahead of a story about it having taken advance sales of £ 15m , which sounds very much like it has come from the theatre 's pr company .
there is much less foreign news than in the past and scant crime coverage .
again the pr companies are doing well with the magic scarf story making a large picture spread on page four and a survey by a retail analysis firm making a page lead about john lewis being britain 's most popular shop .
there is also a page lead about a new drug for eyelashes that does away with the need for mascara and , on an inside page , a large article which plugging a new book and dvd on johnny cash .
the guardian back to top 15 january 1979 front-page headline - road and rail strikes put 1m jobs at risk the labour-supporting paper is clearly embarrassed by the growing " winter of discontent " and offers a lower figure for the number of jobs at risk because of the haulage dispute .

15 january 1999 front-page headline - trial of the century begins guardian circulation jan - jul 1979 - 379,429 jan - jul 1989 - 438,732 jan - jul 1999 - 398,721 jan 2009 - 358,844 source - abc the guardian also leads with the clinton impeachment hearing , with perhaps slightly less relish than the telegraph .
there is a large front-page picture of nelson mandela and fw de klerk with a story suggesting a bitter feud had gone on between the two men behind the scenes .
the story about foster parents jeff and jenny bramley was on page two , probably being of great interest to the paper 's large readership among social workers .
the papua new guinea jungle rescue story and the freeing of the yemen hostage are also page leads .
the review has a large feature about kate winslet .
15 january 2009 front-page headline - ' war on terror was a mistake ' , says miliband during a tour of india foreign secretary david miliband let slip that the whole tone of the bush / blair " war on terror " had been misconceived .
there is also a large picture of the russian tycoon alexander lebedev , who is buying the evening standard .
the guardian shows it too is prone to increasing triviality with page leads on jonathan ross hosting the baftas , the demolition of the astoria venue in london and a story about what presents the royal family received from abroad , which appears to have emanated from a press release .

the mail is also prone to pr spin , with a large picture spread on the " magic scarf " on page three , and a page lead on victoria beckham in that armani underwear again .

the daily telegraph back to top 15 january 1979 front-page headline - cabinet face tory fury daily telegraph circulation jan - jul 1979 - 1,476,887 jan - jul 1989 - 1,113,033 jan - jul 1999 - 1,044,740 jan 2009 - 842,912 source - abc the telegraph openly gloats as jim callaghan 's labour government struggles amid a tide of industrial strife .

the main photo is of chinese peasants protesting in what was then known as peking .
inside , the paper contains large amounts of foreign news , including a page-four lead about muslim rebels killing 100 troops of the afghan communist government .
eleven months later the soviet union invaded to support the kabul regime .
several columnists put the boot into the government and the trade unions , with one describing strikes as " britain 's disease " .
the paper is only 16 pages , due to a shortage of newsprint .
16 january 1989 front-page headline - israel hits back at waldegrave ' insults ' junior foreign office minister william waldegrave has got himself into trouble with the israeli government for telling them not to be " clever silly " in their dealings with the palestinians and referring to then prime minister yitzhak shamir 's past in the " terrorist " stern gang .

other stories on the inside pages include a man who survived for 22 days lost in the jungles of papua new guinea , an interview with a british hostage freed in yemen , and the ex-boyfriend of gynaecologist dr joan francisco being charged with her murder .
he was later jailed for life .
the paper looks a lot more colourful and better presented than in the 1970s and 1980s but remains full of hard news with little bowing to the growing celebrity culture .
15 january 2009 front-page headline - dismay as minister ' sees the shoots of recovery ' the paper still sometimes dubbed the torygraph tears into baroness vadera for her controversial comments in an interview with itv news .
it makes a nice picture spread , but is it news ?
the front-page picture is a large photograph of the musical oliver , ahead of a story about it having taken advance sales of £ 15m , which sounds very much like it has come from the theatre 's pr company .
there is much less foreign news than in the past and scant crime coverage .
again the pr companies are doing well with the magic scarf story making a large picture spread on page four and a survey by a retail analysis firm making a page lead about john lewis being britain 's most popular shop .
there is also a page lead about a new drug for eyelashes that does away with the need for mascara and , on an inside page , a large article which plugging a new book and dvd on johnny cash .
the guardian back to top 15 january 1979 front-page headline - road and rail strikes put 1m jobs at risk the labour-supporting paper is clearly embarrassed by the growing " winter of discontent " and offers a lower figure for the number of jobs at risk because of the haulage dispute .

15 january 1999 front-page headline - trial of the century begins guardian circulation jan - jul 1979 - 379,429 jan - jul 1989 - 438,732 jan - jul 1999 - 398,721 jan 2009 - 358,844 source - abc the guardian also leads with the clinton impeachment hearing , with perhaps slightly less relish than the telegraph .
there is a large front-page picture of nelson mandela and fw de klerk with a story suggesting a bitter feud had gone on between the two men behind the scenes .
the story about foster parents jeff and jenny bramley was on page two , probably being of great interest to the paper 's large readership among social workers .
the papua new guinea jungle rescue story and the freeing of the yemen hostage are also page leads .
the review has a large feature about kate winslet .
15 january 2009 front-page headline - ' war on terror was a mistake ' , says miliband during a tour of india foreign secretary david miliband let slip that the whole tone of the bush / blair " war on terror " had been misconceived .
there is also a large picture of the russian tycoon alexander lebedev , who is buying the evening standard .
the guardian shows it too is prone to increasing triviality with page leads on jonathan ross hosting the baftas , the demolition of the astoria venue in london and a story about what presents the royal family received from abroad , which appears to have emanated from a press release .

inside , the paper contains large amounts of foreign news , including a page-four lead about muslim rebels killing 100 troops of the afghan communist government .

he was later jailed for life .
the paper looks a lot more colourful and better presented than in the 1970s and 1980s but remains full of hard news with little bowing to the growing celebrity culture .
15 january 2009 front-page headline - dismay as minister ' sees the shoots of recovery ' the paper still sometimes dubbed the torygraph tears into baroness vadera for her controversial comments in an interview with itv news .
it makes a nice picture spread , but is it news ?
the front-page picture is a large photograph of the musical oliver , ahead of a story about it having taken advance sales of £ 15m , which sounds very much like it has come from the theatre 's pr company .
there is much less foreign news than in the past and scant crime coverage .
again the pr companies are doing well with the magic scarf story making a large picture spread on page four and a survey by a retail analysis firm making a page lead about john lewis being britain 's most popular shop .

there is a large front-page picture of nelson mandela and fw de klerk with a story suggesting a bitter feud had gone on between the two men behind the scenes .
the story about foster parents jeff and jenny bramley was on page two , probably being of great interest to the paper 's large readership among social workers .
the papua new guinea jungle rescue story and the freeing of the yemen hostage are also page leads .
the review has a large feature about kate winslet .
15 january 2009 front-page headline - ' war on terror was a mistake ' , says miliband during a tour of india foreign secretary david miliband let slip that the whole tone of the bush / blair " war on terror " had been misconceived .
there is also a large picture of the russian tycoon alexander lebedev , who is buying the evening standard .
the guardian shows it too is prone to increasing triviality with page leads on jonathan ross hosting the baftas , the demolition of the astoria venue in london and a story about what presents the royal family received from abroad , which appears to have emanated from a press release .
