however environmentalists warn that previous climate commitments are way off the mark . delegations from 192 countries are meeting in bonn to continue negotiations towards a global climate deal , which is to be finalised at a much-anticipated un meeting in copenhagen in december .
at the recent g-8 summit in the earthquake-devastated italian town of l 'aquila , developed nations , including the us , promised to limit global warming to two degrees celsius by 2050 .
however , climate experts and environmental groups say even two degrees is far too high and would have cataclysmic consequences .
martin kaiser , who is representing the environmental group greenpeace at the un climate talks , says an increase of two degrees would probably result in the disappearance of the amazon rainforest .
" -lrb- two degrees -rrb- would mean that sea levels would rise by one meter , and it would also mean that much arable land would become so dry that it would no longer be cultivable , " he says .
a replacement for kyoto in total , five rounds of preliminary talks will have been held by the time the copenhagen meeting roles around in december .
this third round of talks is intended as an ' informal meeting ' and is being held in bonn , as were the first two rounds . two further conferences are to be held in bangkok in september and october , and then in barcelona at the beginning of november .
the result of the last conference in bonn was a 300-page document with suggestions from the 192 negotiating countries .
the aim of this week 's meeting is to reduce the document to between 50 and 100 pages ; this will then form the basis of discussions in copenhagen .
suggestions abound ; commitments are scarce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests accompanied the last un climate talks in bonn despite the hundreds of pages of suggestions , solid commitments from un member nations have not been forthcoming .
disputes continue about who should do what and in what time frame .
there are also questions about who should provide financing for developing nations so that they can also combat the effects of climate change .
yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change , recently told the french news agency afp that the kyoto-replacement climate treaty would be crippled without strong commitments from developed nations and would " defeat the whole purpose of the copenhagen agreement . "
developed nations have been reluctant to agree to concrete commitments without the support of developing nations , especially china and india , two of the world 's fastest growing countries with the world 's two largest populations .
however , china and india say that their commitments should not be equal to those of wealthy countries because their populations are poorer and because they say their nations ' growth would be stilted by restrictions .

the aim of this week 's meeting is to reduce the document to between 50 and 100 pages ; this will then form the basis of discussions in copenhagen .
suggestions abound ; commitments are scarce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests accompanied the last un climate talks in bonn despite the hundreds of pages of suggestions , solid commitments from un member nations have not been forthcoming .
disputes continue about who should do what and in what time frame .
there are also questions about who should provide financing for developing nations so that they can also combat the effects of climate change .
yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change , recently told the french news agency afp that the kyoto-replacement climate treaty would be crippled without strong commitments from developed nations and would " defeat the whole purpose of the copenhagen agreement . "
developed nations have been reluctant to agree to concrete commitments without the support of developing nations , especially china and india , two of the world 's fastest growing countries with the world 's two largest populations .
however , china and india say that their commitments should not be equal to those of wealthy countries because their populations are poorer and because they say their nations ' growth would be stilted by restrictions .

the basque separatist group eta is believed to have been behind the attacks . spanish police officials said they were trying to determine the identities of the people behind the bomb blasts . the attacks are believed to have been carried out by the basque separatist group eta .
only a few clues had emerged on monday and authorities could not say whether the bombers were still on the island or if there was an eta terrorist cell on the island itself . it is also unclear whether sunday 's bombers were the same people responsible for a bomb attack that killed two policemen in july . spain 's king juan carlos has condemned the mallorca bombings saying the attacks would not succeed in damaging spain 's democracy . there is speculation that the attacks may have been meant to draw attention to eta ’ s cause rather than to harm people because all of the bombs contained low levels of explosives and were detonated after warnings had been given , giving the authorities time to clear people from the blast sites .
no injuries were reported . the first of sunday 's bombings occurred at a restaurant on the outskirts of palma de mallorca , near a recreational harbor along the road leading from the city center to the island 's airport .
the explosive was hidden in a backpack in one of the restaurant 's bathrooms . the second explosion came about two hours later in another restaurant about 500 meters -lrb- 546 yards -rrb- from the first .
the third came in a nearby underground supermarket shortly afterwards .
the shopping complex had already been sealed off by police . the origin of a fourth explosion - in a restaurant - was being investigated to find out whether it was a gas explosion or another bomb blast .
overnight police were searching for yet another suspected bomb in a hotel complex in palma de mallorca . bombings followed eta claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first two bombs exploded in restaurants while the third went off in a supermarket the attacks are another blow to the island 's tourism industry and came only hours after eta admitted it was behind bombings that claimed the lives of two civil guard officers and a police inspector and injured dozens more in june and july . the group did not initially claim responsibility for an attack in the mallorcan resort town of palmanova on july 30 , but confirmed in a statement in the basque newspaper , gara , on sunday that it had been behind the car bombing . the explosion killed two civil guard officers who had been driving the vehicle at the time . eta also said it was behind a car bombing in the basque city of bilbao in june which claimed the life of police inspector eduardo puelles garcia . the separatists said garcia had been " the chief of police operations against numerous leftist independence activists and against pro-independence youths for the past decades , and the coordinator of different operations against eta . " eta also said it was behind two other attacks , both in july .
one was a car bombing outside of a police barracks , which injured more than 40 people ; the other an attack on the governing socialist party 's offices in the basque town of durango . ai / mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 10.08.2009 verdict due for ex-nazi war criminal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef scheungraber is accused of ordering the murder of 14 people a german court is expected to hand out a verdict against a nazi war criminal 65 years after the end of world war two as two more trials are set to start in the coming months .
will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

it 's another blow to the local tourist industry , with many travelers already concerned about the large number of swine flu cases on the island .
a spokesperson from the german foreign ministry told deutsche welle that the ministry has updated its travel information to make tourists aware of the bombings , with tips such as trying to avoid large crowds .
however , the ministry has not issued a travel warning for mallorca and early indications are that the bombs have not caused tourists to cut short their summer breaks .
sybille zeuch from the german travel association says there is currently no suggestion that the bomb attacks will drive away the 170,000 german tourists now on mallorca .
" what is different from other terrorist attacks is that eta does not want to target tourists and no one has been hurt in these attacks , " zeuch told deutsche welle .
" eta wants to spread fear but they do n't want any victims ; what they want to target is the economy . "
the spanish government has remained defiant , saying the impact on tourism from the blasts will be minimal .
" eta has been trying to inflict damage on the spanish tourism industry for 30 years , " joan mesquida , spain 's state secretary for tourism , said in palma de mallorca on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cordoned off the can tere antoni beach in mallorca after they received bomb warnings allegedly from eta eta responsible ?
all three bombs were planted in ladies ' toilets , indicating that at least one of the attackers was a woman , however police have not yet been unable to formally identify those responsible .
indications are that basque separatist group eta was behind the blasts , after police received warnings earlier in the day that attacks would occur , from someone claiming to be from eta .
the group also admitted responsibility on sunday for a number of recent attacks , including a car bomb on mallorca just over a week ago that killed two civil guards .
thanks to the warnings , no one was hurt in the explosions .
the explosives were also not particularly powerful , leading authorities to believe that the attacks were intended only as a warning and not to cause injury .
authorities are investigating whether the bombs were set off with the use of timers , which would have allowed the devices to be planted several days in advance and given those responsible time to escape .

with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .

out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .

but the indigenous communities are using both ancient knowledge and modern technology to protect biodiversity and stop further destruction . the lush green of the rain forest offers rich natural resources which the ashaninka indians have lived on for centuries .
at the yoreka atame school of primeval forestry in brazil , young indigenous and non-indigenous people have been learning how to make use of them in a sustainable way . since 2007 , the school has taught more than 2,000 participants skills like the cultivating fruit trees , keeping bees , and erecting dams in creeks and lakes to enhance spawning grounds for fish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cultivating traditional plants is part of the curriculum " that 's how we ashaninka indians here in the border region between brazil and peru want to pass on our traditional knowledge , " said moises piyako .
he cofounded the yoreka atame school together with his brother benki in 2007 . illegal logging threatens biodiversity political problems between brazil and its neighbor peru make life complicated for the indigenous people in the border region . " we are suffering from peruvian logging companies , and now the peruvian government also wants to dig for oil along the border , " said moises piyako . illegal timber-fellers from peru are increasingly encroaching on the rainforest on both sides of the border . the land and its resources belong to the ashaninka , according to the indigenous and tribal peoples convention 169 adopted by the international labour organisation , ilo .
it recognizes the rights of ownership of the peoples over the lands which they traditionally occupy .
but peru has been trying to circumnavigate international law by granting mining concessions for areas that are owned by indigenous peoples . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ashaninka live in the border region between brazil and peru " in the process , peruvian timber companies even illegally enter brazilian territory , " said ashaninka spokesman benki piyako .
" illegal logging is putting our whole region and its biodiversity at risk . " the invasion of ashaninka rainforests by illegal loggers started in 2001 with a company called forestal venao , which is owned by the daughter of the former peruvian president , alberto fujimori .
he was recently put on trial for corruption and has already been convicted to 25 years in prison for severe human rights violations and killing opposition politicians . his daughter , keiko fujimori , has announced her candidacy for the presidency as well as her aim to officially pardon her father should she come to power .
her political campaign is partially funded by the earnings from her timber company . demand for a ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal logging damages the rainforest to prevent forestal venao from wreaking further havoc on brazilian territory , benki and moises piyako demand a world-wide ban on imports of wood illegally felled in rainforests . " there are only a few specimen left of many of the tree species , and we are trying to recultivate these economic plants , " they said , adding that there is a lack of understanding for the importance of managing resources sustainably . " we must make sure that our natural resources are not destroyed in the struggle for survival . " in their fight for environmental protection , the ashaninka combine traditional knowledge and modern technology .
some remote communities have already set up satellite-supported communication systems in the rainforest .
by checking satellite photographs on a computer , the communities can monitor illegal logging activities or the illegal construction of roads in their region . " we install this monitoring system , and we teach the local people how to operate the gps technology , " said benki piyako . hi-tech to protect the rainforest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 certificates pay for recultivation efforts in addition , benki piyako and his village of apiwtxa have set up a video blog on life in the rainforest .
there , they also post satellite photos that document how illegal logging is devastating huge areas .
it is their aim to teach people how the forest and its resources can be used without destroying them .
and they also want to set up a global network supporting the protection of their region . modern tools are also employed when it comes to environmental protection . the indigenous organization in apiwtxa sells co2 certificates , and the ashaninka also offer them to companies that want to support the protection of the rainforest .

it 's another blow to the local tourist industry , with many travelers already concerned about the large number of swine flu cases on the island .
a spokesperson from the german foreign ministry told deutsche welle that the ministry has updated its travel information to make tourists aware of the bombings , with tips such as trying to avoid large crowds .
however , the ministry has not issued a travel warning for mallorca and early indications are that the bombs have not caused tourists to cut short their summer breaks .
sybille zeuch from the german travel association says there is currently no suggestion that the bomb attacks will drive away the 170,000 german tourists now on mallorca .
" what is different from other terrorist attacks is that eta does not want to target tourists and no one has been hurt in these attacks , " zeuch told deutsche welle .
" eta wants to spread fear but they do n't want any victims ; what they want to target is the economy . "
the spanish government has remained defiant , saying the impact on tourism from the blasts will be minimal .
" eta has been trying to inflict damage on the spanish tourism industry for 30 years , " joan mesquida , spain 's state secretary for tourism , said in palma de mallorca on monday .

all three bombs were planted in ladies ' toilets , indicating that at least one of the attackers was a woman , however police have not yet been unable to formally identify those responsible .
indications are that basque separatist group eta was behind the blasts , after police received warnings earlier in the day that attacks would occur , from someone claiming to be from eta .
the group also admitted responsibility on sunday for a number of recent attacks , including a car bomb on mallorca just over a week ago that killed two civil guards .
thanks to the warnings , no one was hurt in the explosions .
the explosives were also not particularly powerful , leading authorities to believe that the attacks were intended only as a warning and not to cause injury .
authorities are investigating whether the bombs were set off with the use of timers , which would have allowed the devices to be planted several days in advance and given those responsible time to escape .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 10.08.2009 international partners watch south american summit with interest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 12-nation unasur meets to discuss common issues the summit of the union of south american nations -lrb- unasur -rrb- in quito , ecuador brought together the heads of state of the 12-member bloc to discuss the economic crisis , regional security and other common issues . unasur was set up in 2008 , bringing together argentina , bolivia , brazil , chile , colombia , ecuador , guyana , paraguay , peru , suriname , uruguay and venezuela in a new union after its predecessor , the south american community of nations -lrb- csn -rrb- , became defunct in 2007 .
unasur was launched to promote integration among south american countries and as such has a number of initiatives at its heart which intend to consolidate trade , security and infrastructure policies across its member states .
among many of the initiatives set up at its creation , unasur aims to create a single market to eliminate the fees for non-sensitive products by 2014 and for sensitive products -lrb- i.e. , beef , dairy -rrb- by 2019 .
unasur is also pursuing an initiative for infrastructure integration of south america -lrb- iirsa -rrb- , including the construction of the inter-oceanic highway to link the pacific coast countries to allow better connections with bolivia , argentina , peru and brazil .
the presidency of unasur rotates on an annual basis , and is currently held by chilean president michelle bachelet .
the presidency will be handed to ecuador during the summit held in its capital .
the outcomes of the 2009 unasur summit are likely to have a wider significance outside of south america , with the european union and germany in particular interested in the bloc 's discussions .
as well as developments in trade relations , germany will be looking at the increased collaboration within unasur with a view to possible effects this may have on its bilateral relations .
germany 's interests feature heavily on trade out of the 12 unasur countries , germany is closest , in terms of trade and political dialogue , with brazil .
brazil is germany 's main trade partner in the unasur , with seven percent of brazilian imports coming from germany , making it brazil 's main trading partner in the eu , while five percent of brazilian exports come to germany , second only to the netherlands within the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and lula have a tight trading partnership " brazil is germany 's main partner within this country-group , " claudia zilla , a latin america expert with the americas research division at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" germany imports iron ore , auto parts , machinery , coffee , soy , animal feed , chemical products , oil , paper pulp , meat and metals from brazil .
brazil imports machinery , chemical products , auto parts , electro technology , and medicine from germany . "
zilla explained that , while trade - specifically with brazil - is an important part of germany 's involvement in south america , it is far from being its only commitment .
berlin sees opportunities to forge partnerships on a number of global issues with south american governments within unasur .
in terms of international development cooperation with south america , germany 's main partners in bilateral programs are peru , ecuador , colombia , brazil , and particularly bolivia .
partnerships pursued ; opportunities missed " besides investment and trade , germany is interested in global governance , " zilla said .
" in some policy areas like environment and energy , south american countries have high potential to become partners in global cooperation .
germany and south america share important values like multilateralism and peaceful conflict resolution .
but this does not mean both parts exploit these opportunities .
there is a lack of sustainable engagement and strategic coordination between both sides on an international level .
bildunterschrift : germany actively seeks cooperation with unasur members but opportunities are often squandered " democratic values are always an important component of germany 's partnership programs , of political dialogue and international economic cooperation , " she added .
" but it does not mean that the intensity of germany 's relationship with south american countries goes hand in hand with their democratic quality . "
" on the one hand , some cooperation with less democratic countries can be a valuable contribution to deeper democratization .
on the other hand , latin american democracies are not frozen political systems , but dynamic ones .
this makes things tough at times , as it is not easy to constantly adapt foreign relations to the changes in each country , " she said .
while common policies on tackling the effects of the global financial crisis and issues of trade and security are the main topics for the 2009 meeting , the summit is likely to be overshadowed by the row simmering between a number of unasur 's members over colombia 's plans to allow the united states use of seven military bases in its territory .
the official reason given for the us approach by alvaro uribe 's government is the fight against drug trafficking , which fuels the activities of leftist colombian rebels that have been fighting the state for more than 40 years .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , a long-time antagonist of uribe , has voiced strong opposition to colombia 's plans , and moved to freeze ties with bogota as well as recalling the venezuelan ambassador .
he considers the narcotics interdiction a pretense , and has accused the us of seeking to establish colombia as a " yankee " platform for attacks on other countries in latin america .
berlin unlikely to comment on us base plan for colombia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela and germany have a low-level relationship germany has a low-level relationship with venezuela and as such is highly unlikely to get involved in any spat over us influence in colombia .
venezuela 's trade dealings are focused on the united states while chavez 's foreign policy has a strong south-south-dimension , oriented toward his own region or toward non-eu countries like iran and russia .
" i can not imagine that germany would see anything wrong with -lrb- colombia 's plan -rrb- .
the us has had its own military base in manta for a long time , " said zilla .
" now the us is looking for alternatives after ecuador decided not to renew the lease on the base , it makes sense that -lrb- colombian president alvaro -rrb- uribe is willing to let the us use colombian bases . "
as is often the case , chavez is the most outspoken critic of us plans in latin america , but other leaders around the region have expressed reservations too after uribe toured seven south american countries to explain his plans last week .
brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva demanded formal guarantees that the planned deal between bogota and washington would not allow the use of colombian bases to launch actions on other countries in the region .
" it is essential to grant some kind of formal guarantee , a legal guarantee , that possible -lrb- us military -rrb- operations will happen strictly within colombian territory , " brazilian presidential spokesman marcelo baumbach stressed last friday .
" there is a suggestion for there to be greater transparency , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim had said earlier .
according to amorim , lula hopes all doubts can be dispelled " calmly , based on technical considerations " at the unasur summit .
lula stressed that he favors " bilateral and multilateral cooperation between south american nations to combat drug trafficking , without external interferences . "

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

the basque separatist group eta is believed to have been behind the attacks . spanish police officials said they were trying to determine the identities of the people behind the bomb blasts . the attacks are believed to have been carried out by the basque separatist group eta .
only a few clues had emerged on monday and authorities could not say whether the bombers were still on the island or if there was an eta terrorist cell on the island itself . it is also unclear whether sunday 's bombers were the same people responsible for a bomb attack that killed two policemen in july . spain 's king juan carlos has condemned the mallorca bombings saying the attacks would not succeed in damaging spain 's democracy . there is speculation that the attacks may have been meant to draw attention to eta ’ s cause rather than to harm people because all of the bombs contained low levels of explosives and were detonated after warnings had been given , giving the authorities time to clear people from the blast sites .
no injuries were reported . the first of sunday 's bombings occurred at a restaurant on the outskirts of palma de mallorca , near a recreational harbor along the road leading from the city center to the island 's airport .
the explosive was hidden in a backpack in one of the restaurant 's bathrooms . the second explosion came about two hours later in another restaurant about 500 meters -lrb- 546 yards -rrb- from the first .
the third came in a nearby underground supermarket shortly afterwards .
the shopping complex had already been sealed off by police . the origin of a fourth explosion - in a restaurant - was being investigated to find out whether it was a gas explosion or another bomb blast .
overnight police were searching for yet another suspected bomb in a hotel complex in palma de mallorca . bombings followed eta claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first two bombs exploded in restaurants while the third went off in a supermarket the attacks are another blow to the island 's tourism industry and came only hours after eta admitted it was behind bombings that claimed the lives of two civil guard officers and a police inspector and injured dozens more in june and july . the group did not initially claim responsibility for an attack in the mallorcan resort town of palmanova on july 30 , but confirmed in a statement in the basque newspaper , gara , on sunday that it had been behind the car bombing . the explosion killed two civil guard officers who had been driving the vehicle at the time . eta also said it was behind a car bombing in the basque city of bilbao in june which claimed the life of police inspector eduardo puelles garcia . the separatists said garcia had been " the chief of police operations against numerous leftist independence activists and against pro-independence youths for the past decades , and the coordinator of different operations against eta . " eta also said it was behind two other attacks , both in july .
one was a car bombing outside of a police barracks , which injured more than 40 people ; the other an attack on the governing socialist party 's offices in the basque town of durango . ai / mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however environmentalists warn that previous climate commitments are way off the mark . delegations from 192 countries are meeting in bonn to continue negotiations towards a global climate deal , which is to be finalised at a much-anticipated un meeting in copenhagen in december .
at the recent g-8 summit in the earthquake-devastated italian town of l 'aquila , developed nations , including the us , promised to limit global warming to two degrees celsius by 2050 .
however , climate experts and environmental groups say even two degrees is far too high and would have cataclysmic consequences .
martin kaiser , who is representing the environmental group greenpeace at the un climate talks , says an increase of two degrees would probably result in the disappearance of the amazon rainforest .
" -lrb- two degrees -rrb- would mean that sea levels would rise by one meter , and it would also mean that much arable land would become so dry that it would no longer be cultivable , " he says .
a replacement for kyoto in total , five rounds of preliminary talks will have been held by the time the copenhagen meeting roles around in december .
this third round of talks is intended as an ' informal meeting ' and is being held in bonn , as were the first two rounds . two further conferences are to be held in bangkok in september and october , and then in barcelona at the beginning of november .
the result of the last conference in bonn was a 300-page document with suggestions from the 192 negotiating countries .
the aim of this week 's meeting is to reduce the document to between 50 and 100 pages ; this will then form the basis of discussions in copenhagen .
suggestions abound ; commitments are scarce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests accompanied the last un climate talks in bonn despite the hundreds of pages of suggestions , solid commitments from un member nations have not been forthcoming .
disputes continue about who should do what and in what time frame .
there are also questions about who should provide financing for developing nations so that they can also combat the effects of climate change .
yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change , recently told the french news agency afp that the kyoto-replacement climate treaty would be crippled without strong commitments from developed nations and would " defeat the whole purpose of the copenhagen agreement . "
developed nations have been reluctant to agree to concrete commitments without the support of developing nations , especially china and india , two of the world 's fastest growing countries with the world 's two largest populations .
however , china and india say that their commitments should not be equal to those of wealthy countries because their populations are poorer and because they say their nations ' growth would be stilted by restrictions .

praised for his musical versatility , he told dw how all musical genres are linked - and what he 's going to do when he retires . martin grubinger has performed in some of the world 's top concert halls , including the koelner philharmonie , the concertgebouw in amsterdam and carnegie hall in new york .
he is currently active in the european summer music festival scene , playing at the salzburg festival in austria and at germany 's schleswig-holstein music festival , where he is an artist in residence . deutsche welle : you 're at home in practically every musical genre .
how did you become such a versatile musician ? martin grubinger : for us percussionists , there 's a logical connection between contemporary music and jazz .
or take salsa , samba , tango , funk , fusion , rock - all of these belong together for us percussionists .
every genre has a connection to all the others and percussion is at home in all these areas . was exactly is the connection between jazz and contemporary music ? contemporary music has a lot to do with percussion because the composers today use a lot of different percussion instruments in their works .
they 're discovering the instrument , both in solo and orchestral contexts - there 's always quite a lot of percussion in contemporary compositions .
without percussion , the music would n't work - without the rhythm and the stringency . can you describe the different challenges that jazz and contemporary music involve ? yes , of course these different types of music have to be approached differently .
with jazz , you are creative and you can do a lot - every evening is different .
in contemporary music , it 's important to the composers that you stay true to the score and actually play what 's written .
that 's crucial because the composers have something particular in mind . if i were to improvise a work by iannis xenakis , for example , it would be a scandal , a falsification .
it would totally miss the composer 's idea .
xenakis mathematically calculates the relationship between the instruments .
that means if you do n't play exactly what 's in the score , the result would be total chaos . with jazz , it 's completely different .
there , you just have to stay within the meter and the harmonies and otherwise you 're pretty much free . bildunterschrift : without percussion , contemporary music would n't work , says grubinger this year , you 're an artist in residence at the schleswig-holstein music festival , where you 've given a wide variety of workshops and concerts and with diverse programs .
all of your concerts were sold out , which earned you the label " audience magnet . " yes , it 's actually really funny .
for us musicians , things happen via friendships and connections .
you hear people when you 're on tour - you sit in concerts and think , he has to play with my ensemble , i want to work with him ! in our case , we 're in a position to bring a big audience into the concert hall , so of course the good musicians want to play with us .
that 's a big advantage , because that way we can gain a lot of quality and expertise in very different areas . the other musicians who work with you have said they really enjoy it .
is there a reciprocal effect with the members of your ensemble ? it 's unbelievable what you can learn on such an evening , you 're sensitized to entirely new things .
as a percussionist , you work in one direction , then there 's a violinist who has a completely different idea of how things should sound and a much bigger palette of colors .
he has a different idea of phrasing and rhythm , and an entirely different perspective on music .
it 's important , then , to learn to say , i want to watch out for those things too . you once said you work with a sports medicine specialist to be able to perform at 100 percent capacity even when your pulse is running at an average of 160 beats per minute during a concert .
you always perform from memory - do you ever have time to relax ? i 'm passionate about cycling and can relax really well when i 'm doing that , or when i 'm playing or watching soccer .
i like to read about socio-political things and i love history .
when i stop playing percussion , i want to study history . interview : magdalene melchers -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

every genre has a connection to all the others and percussion is at home in all these areas . was exactly is the connection between jazz and contemporary music ? contemporary music has a lot to do with percussion because the composers today use a lot of different percussion instruments in their works .

without percussion , the music would n't work - without the rhythm and the stringency . can you describe the different challenges that jazz and contemporary music involve ? yes , of course these different types of music have to be approached differently .
with jazz , you are creative and you can do a lot - every evening is different .
in contemporary music , it 's important to the composers that you stay true to the score and actually play what 's written .
that 's crucial because the composers have something particular in mind . if i were to improvise a work by iannis xenakis , for example , it would be a scandal , a falsification .
it would totally miss the composer 's idea .
xenakis mathematically calculates the relationship between the instruments .

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

the basque separatist group eta is believed to have been behind the attacks . spanish police officials said they were trying to determine the identities of the people behind the bomb blasts . the attacks are believed to have been carried out by the basque separatist group eta .
only a few clues had emerged on monday and authorities could not say whether the bombers were still on the island or if there was an eta terrorist cell on the island itself . it is also unclear whether sunday 's bombers were the same people responsible for a bomb attack that killed two policemen in july . spain 's king juan carlos has condemned the mallorca bombings saying the attacks would not succeed in damaging spain 's democracy . there is speculation that the attacks may have been meant to draw attention to eta ’ s cause rather than to harm people because all of the bombs contained low levels of explosives and were detonated after warnings had been given , giving the authorities time to clear people from the blast sites .
no injuries were reported . the first of sunday 's bombings occurred at a restaurant on the outskirts of palma de mallorca , near a recreational harbor along the road leading from the city center to the island 's airport .
the explosive was hidden in a backpack in one of the restaurant 's bathrooms . the second explosion came about two hours later in another restaurant about 500 meters -lrb- 546 yards -rrb- from the first .
the third came in a nearby underground supermarket shortly afterwards .
the shopping complex had already been sealed off by police . the origin of a fourth explosion - in a restaurant - was being investigated to find out whether it was a gas explosion or another bomb blast .
overnight police were searching for yet another suspected bomb in a hotel complex in palma de mallorca . bombings followed eta claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first two bombs exploded in restaurants while the third went off in a supermarket the attacks are another blow to the island 's tourism industry and came only hours after eta admitted it was behind bombings that claimed the lives of two civil guard officers and a police inspector and injured dozens more in june and july . the group did not initially claim responsibility for an attack in the mallorcan resort town of palmanova on july 30 , but confirmed in a statement in the basque newspaper , gara , on sunday that it had been behind the car bombing . the explosion killed two civil guard officers who had been driving the vehicle at the time . eta also said it was behind a car bombing in the basque city of bilbao in june which claimed the life of police inspector eduardo puelles garcia . the separatists said garcia had been " the chief of police operations against numerous leftist independence activists and against pro-independence youths for the past decades , and the coordinator of different operations against eta . " eta also said it was behind two other attacks , both in july .
one was a car bombing outside of a police barracks , which injured more than 40 people ; the other an attack on the governing socialist party 's offices in the basque town of durango . ai / mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the confessions are expected to shorten the trial of the four men . in his wide-ranging confession , suspected ring leader fritz gelowicz told the court how the group 's plans for a terror attack in germany developed .
according to his confession in a duesseldorf court , the alleged mastermind of the group took part in a three-month terrorist training camp in pakistan in 2006 .
there , a plot was hatched to attack american targets , particularly military personnel , in germany .
part of the training dealt with weapons , such as kalashnikov machine guns , and the suspects were also reportedly trained in explosives and circuitry for bomb making .
prosecution lawyer volker brinkmann said ahead of the trial that the suspects had admitted to their goal of " killing as many americans as possible . "
unprecedented confessions the members of the so-called sauerland terror cell have been questioned by police for the past four weeks since the court adjourned for its summer recess .
their written testimonies now run to over 1,500 pages .
the confessions are more extensive than expected and they are likely to speed up the trial and reduce the sentences .

international security expert michael lueders says the confessions could significantly reduce the length of the trial .
" in the beginning , there was talk of two years for this process , but now people talk about three or four months , " lueders told deutsche welle .
this is one of the biggest terrorism trials in germany since those involving the urban guerrillas of the red army faction in the 1970s .

two of the suspects , gelowicz and daniel schneider , aged 29 and 23 respectively , are german converts to islam .

selek was later caught in turkey .
although the men were apprehended before any attacks took place , the fact that such ' home grown ' terrorists may pose a real threat in germany is a major cause for concern , says international security expert michael lueders .
" not everyone who converts to islam is radical , but some people are , and this is really a room for concern for most security analysts in germany , " said lueders , " and nobody really knows how to solve this issue .

the basque separatist group eta is believed to have been behind the attacks . spanish police officials said they were trying to determine the identities of the people behind the bomb blasts . the attacks are believed to have been carried out by the basque separatist group eta .
only a few clues had emerged on monday and authorities could not say whether the bombers were still on the island or if there was an eta terrorist cell on the island itself . it is also unclear whether sunday 's bombers were the same people responsible for a bomb attack that killed two policemen in july . spain 's king juan carlos has condemned the mallorca bombings saying the attacks would not succeed in damaging spain 's democracy . there is speculation that the attacks may have been meant to draw attention to eta ’ s cause rather than to harm people because all of the bombs contained low levels of explosives and were detonated after warnings had been given , giving the authorities time to clear people from the blast sites .
no injuries were reported . the first of sunday 's bombings occurred at a restaurant on the outskirts of palma de mallorca , near a recreational harbor along the road leading from the city center to the island 's airport .
the explosive was hidden in a backpack in one of the restaurant 's bathrooms . the second explosion came about two hours later in another restaurant about 500 meters -lrb- 546 yards -rrb- from the first .
the third came in a nearby underground supermarket shortly afterwards .
the shopping complex had already been sealed off by police . the origin of a fourth explosion - in a restaurant - was being investigated to find out whether it was a gas explosion or another bomb blast .
overnight police were searching for yet another suspected bomb in a hotel complex in palma de mallorca . bombings followed eta claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first two bombs exploded in restaurants while the third went off in a supermarket the attacks are another blow to the island 's tourism industry and came only hours after eta admitted it was behind bombings that claimed the lives of two civil guard officers and a police inspector and injured dozens more in june and july . the group did not initially claim responsibility for an attack in the mallorcan resort town of palmanova on july 30 , but confirmed in a statement in the basque newspaper , gara , on sunday that it had been behind the car bombing . the explosion killed two civil guard officers who had been driving the vehicle at the time . eta also said it was behind a car bombing in the basque city of bilbao in june which claimed the life of police inspector eduardo puelles garcia . the separatists said garcia had been " the chief of police operations against numerous leftist independence activists and against pro-independence youths for the past decades , and the coordinator of different operations against eta . " eta also said it was behind two other attacks , both in july .
one was a car bombing outside of a police barracks , which injured more than 40 people ; the other an attack on the governing socialist party 's offices in the basque town of durango . ai / mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only a few clues had emerged on monday and authorities could not say whether the bombers were still on the island or if there was an eta terrorist cell on the island itself . it is also unclear whether sunday 's bombers were the same people responsible for a bomb attack that killed two policemen in july . spain 's king juan carlos has condemned the mallorca bombings saying the attacks would not succeed in damaging spain 's democracy . there is speculation that the attacks may have been meant to draw attention to eta ’ s cause rather than to harm people because all of the bombs contained low levels of explosives and were detonated after warnings had been given , giving the authorities time to clear people from the blast sites .
no injuries were reported . the first of sunday 's bombings occurred at a restaurant on the outskirts of palma de mallorca , near a recreational harbor along the road leading from the city center to the island 's airport .
the explosive was hidden in a backpack in one of the restaurant 's bathrooms . the second explosion came about two hours later in another restaurant about 500 meters -lrb- 546 yards -rrb- from the first .
the third came in a nearby underground supermarket shortly afterwards .
the shopping complex had already been sealed off by police . the origin of a fourth explosion - in a restaurant - was being investigated to find out whether it was a gas explosion or another bomb blast .
overnight police were searching for yet another suspected bomb in a hotel complex in palma de mallorca . bombings followed eta claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first two bombs exploded in restaurants while the third went off in a supermarket the attacks are another blow to the island 's tourism industry and came only hours after eta admitted it was behind bombings that claimed the lives of two civil guard officers and a police inspector and injured dozens more in june and july . the group did not initially claim responsibility for an attack in the mallorcan resort town of palmanova on july 30 , but confirmed in a statement in the basque newspaper , gara , on sunday that it had been behind the car bombing . the explosion killed two civil guard officers who had been driving the vehicle at the time . eta also said it was behind a car bombing in the basque city of bilbao in june which claimed the life of police inspector eduardo puelles garcia . the separatists said garcia had been " the chief of police operations against numerous leftist independence activists and against pro-independence youths for the past decades , and the coordinator of different operations against eta . " eta also said it was behind two other attacks , both in july .
one was a car bombing outside of a police barracks , which injured more than 40 people ; the other an attack on the governing socialist party 's offices in the basque town of durango . ai / mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 10.08.2009 suspected leader of sauerland terror cell confesses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz gelowicz , the alleged mastermind behind the sauerland cell , confessed to planning terror attacks in germany the first of four alleged islamist militants known as the sauerland cell took the stand to confess his role in planning terror attacks in germany .
the confessions are expected to shorten the trial of the four men . in his wide-ranging confession , suspected ring leader fritz gelowicz told the court how the group 's plans for a terror attack in germany developed .
according to his confession in a duesseldorf court , the alleged mastermind of the group took part in a three-month terrorist training camp in pakistan in 2006 .
there , a plot was hatched to attack american targets , particularly military personnel , in germany .
part of the training dealt with weapons , such as kalashnikov machine guns , and the suspects were also reportedly trained in explosives and circuitry for bomb making .
prosecution lawyer volker brinkmann said ahead of the trial that the suspects had admitted to their goal of " killing as many americans as possible . "
unprecedented confessions the members of the so-called sauerland terror cell have been questioned by police for the past four weeks since the court adjourned for its summer recess .
their written testimonies now run to over 1,500 pages .
the confessions are more extensive than expected and they are likely to speed up the trial and reduce the sentences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presiding judge ottmar breidling called the wide-ranging confessions " impressive " chief judge ottmar breidling said the questioning during the four-week break had revealed an unexpectedly " impressive " range of information .
international security expert michael lueders says the confessions could significantly reduce the length of the trial .
" in the beginning , there was talk of two years for this process , but now people talk about three or four months , " lueders told deutsche welle .
this is one of the biggest terrorism trials in germany since those involving the urban guerrillas of the red army faction in the 1970s .
suspects accused of planning massive attacks the men allegedly formed their terror cell for the islamic jihad union and stand accused of plotting at least three bomb attacks in german cities targeting us citizens .
authorities say the group aimed to carry out attacks as deadly as those of september 11 , 2001 which killed around 3,000 people in the united states .
two of the suspects , gelowicz and daniel schneider , aged 29 and 23 respectively , are german converts to islam .
a third suspect , attila selek , is a 24-year-old german citizen of turkish origin , while 30-year-old adem yilmaz is a turkish national .
the threat of ' home grown ' terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the suspects were arrested in september 2007 with hydrogen peroxide drums the sauerland cell is named after a western german region where three of the men were apprehended in september 2007 along with 26 detonators and 12 drums of hydrogen peroxide , a substance used in the deadly attacks on london 's transport system two years earlier .
selek was later caught in turkey .
although the men were apprehended before any attacks took place , the fact that such ' home grown ' terrorists may pose a real threat in germany is a major cause for concern , says international security expert michael lueders .
" not everyone who converts to islam is radical , but some people are , and this is really a room for concern for most security analysts in germany , " said lueders , " and nobody really knows how to solve this issue .
so these so-called converts are really targeted by police . "
if convicted , the suspected terrorists could face up to 15 years in prison. mz / dpa / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

throughout the most recent dispute with iran he has continually called for restraint .

the immediate reason for this is the trial in tehran against a frenchwoman and two iranian employees of the french and the british embassies .

bildt 's comments were not received well in tehran .
hassan ghashghavi , a spokesman for the iranian foreign ministry , reacted by saying it was beyond any legal logic to claim a trial in one country would simultaneously challenge 27 other countries .
ghashgavi added that iran had never interfered in elections or trials in the eu and expected the eu to do the same .
he rejected eu calls to let the defendants go free .

throughout the most recent dispute with iran he has continually called for restraint .
but his patience seems to have worn thin .
the immediate reason for this is the trial in tehran against a frenchwoman and two iranian employees of the french and the british embassies .
they are all accused of spying against iran and taking part in efforts to topple the islamic system .
in an interview , mr bildt said it was a show trial .
“ i 've protested very sharply on behalf of the european union .
this is not against individual persons or countries but against the european union as a whole , and this is exactly how we are treating this matter , ” said bildt .
bildt 's comments were not received well in tehran .
hassan ghashghavi , a spokesman for the iranian foreign ministry , reacted by saying it was beyond any legal logic to claim a trial in one country would simultaneously challenge 27 other countries .
ghashgavi added that iran had never interfered in elections or trials in the eu and expected the eu to do the same .
he rejected eu calls to let the defendants go free .
“ the islamic republic of iran will stand firm against irrational demands , “ said gashghavi .
eu nations also criticize trials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clotilde reiss in the dock a spokeswoman for the british foreign office called the decision to put the british embasssy 's chief political analyst , hossein rassam on trial , fully unacceptable .
in a statement released by the french foreign ministry , the french called the accusations against reiss " without foundation . "
paris has categorically denied espionage charges levied against reiss , a lecturer at a university in iran .
clotilde reiss , a french lecturer , has confessed that she supplied information on post-election protests to foreign embassies .
the iranian employee of the british embassy has said he was sent to attend and monitor the demonstrations .
eu diplomats have suggested that the accused have made these statements under pressure .

throughout the most recent dispute with iran he has continually called for restraint .
but his patience seems to have worn thin .
the immediate reason for this is the trial in tehran against a frenchwoman and two iranian employees of the french and the british embassies .
they are all accused of spying against iran and taking part in efforts to topple the islamic system .
in an interview , mr bildt said it was a show trial .
“ i 've protested very sharply on behalf of the european union .
this is not against individual persons or countries but against the european union as a whole , and this is exactly how we are treating this matter , ” said bildt .
bildt 's comments were not received well in tehran .

however environmentalists warn that previous climate commitments are way off the mark . delegations from 192 countries are meeting in bonn to continue negotiations towards a global climate deal , which is to be finalised at a much-anticipated un meeting in copenhagen in december .
at the recent g-8 summit in the earthquake-devastated italian town of l 'aquila , developed nations , including the us , promised to limit global warming to two degrees celsius by 2050 .
however , climate experts and environmental groups say even two degrees is far too high and would have cataclysmic consequences .
martin kaiser , who is representing the environmental group greenpeace at the un climate talks , says an increase of two degrees would probably result in the disappearance of the amazon rainforest .
" -lrb- two degrees -rrb- would mean that sea levels would rise by one meter , and it would also mean that much arable land would become so dry that it would no longer be cultivable , " he says .

this third round of talks is intended as an ' informal meeting ' and is being held in bonn , as were the first two rounds . two further conferences are to be held in bangkok in september and october , and then in barcelona at the beginning of november .
the result of the last conference in bonn was a 300-page document with suggestions from the 192 negotiating countries .
the aim of this week 's meeting is to reduce the document to between 50 and 100 pages ; this will then form the basis of discussions in copenhagen .
suggestions abound ; commitments are scarce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests accompanied the last un climate talks in bonn despite the hundreds of pages of suggestions , solid commitments from un member nations have not been forthcoming .
disputes continue about who should do what and in what time frame .
there are also questions about who should provide financing for developing nations so that they can also combat the effects of climate change .
yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change , recently told the french news agency afp that the kyoto-replacement climate treaty would be crippled without strong commitments from developed nations and would " defeat the whole purpose of the copenhagen agreement . "
developed nations have been reluctant to agree to concrete commitments without the support of developing nations , especially china and india , two of the world 's fastest growing countries with the world 's two largest populations .
however , china and india say that their commitments should not be equal to those of wealthy countries because their populations are poorer and because they say their nations ' growth would be stilted by restrictions .

the basque separatist group eta is believed to have been behind the attacks . spanish police officials said they were trying to determine the identities of the people behind the bomb blasts . the attacks are believed to have been carried out by the basque separatist group eta .
only a few clues had emerged on monday and authorities could not say whether the bombers were still on the island or if there was an eta terrorist cell on the island itself . it is also unclear whether sunday 's bombers were the same people responsible for a bomb attack that killed two policemen in july . spain 's king juan carlos has condemned the mallorca bombings saying the attacks would not succeed in damaging spain 's democracy . there is speculation that the attacks may have been meant to draw attention to eta ’ s cause rather than to harm people because all of the bombs contained low levels of explosives and were detonated after warnings had been given , giving the authorities time to clear people from the blast sites .
no injuries were reported . the first of sunday 's bombings occurred at a restaurant on the outskirts of palma de mallorca , near a recreational harbor along the road leading from the city center to the island 's airport .
the explosive was hidden in a backpack in one of the restaurant 's bathrooms . the second explosion came about two hours later in another restaurant about 500 meters -lrb- 546 yards -rrb- from the first .
the third came in a nearby underground supermarket shortly afterwards .
the shopping complex had already been sealed off by police . the origin of a fourth explosion - in a restaurant - was being investigated to find out whether it was a gas explosion or another bomb blast .
overnight police were searching for yet another suspected bomb in a hotel complex in palma de mallorca . bombings followed eta claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first two bombs exploded in restaurants while the third went off in a supermarket the attacks are another blow to the island 's tourism industry and came only hours after eta admitted it was behind bombings that claimed the lives of two civil guard officers and a police inspector and injured dozens more in june and july . the group did not initially claim responsibility for an attack in the mallorcan resort town of palmanova on july 30 , but confirmed in a statement in the basque newspaper , gara , on sunday that it had been behind the car bombing . the explosion killed two civil guard officers who had been driving the vehicle at the time . eta also said it was behind a car bombing in the basque city of bilbao in june which claimed the life of police inspector eduardo puelles garcia . the separatists said garcia had been " the chief of police operations against numerous leftist independence activists and against pro-independence youths for the past decades , and the coordinator of different operations against eta . " eta also said it was behind two other attacks , both in july .
one was a car bombing outside of a police barracks , which injured more than 40 people ; the other an attack on the governing socialist party 's offices in the basque town of durango . ai / mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however environmentalists warn that previous climate commitments are way off the mark . delegations from 192 countries are meeting in bonn to continue negotiations towards a global climate deal , which is to be finalised at a much-anticipated un meeting in copenhagen in december .
at the recent g-8 summit in the earthquake-devastated italian town of l 'aquila , developed nations , including the us , promised to limit global warming to two degrees celsius by 2050 .
however , climate experts and environmental groups say even two degrees is far too high and would have cataclysmic consequences .
martin kaiser , who is representing the environmental group greenpeace at the un climate talks , says an increase of two degrees would probably result in the disappearance of the amazon rainforest .
" -lrb- two degrees -rrb- would mean that sea levels would rise by one meter , and it would also mean that much arable land would become so dry that it would no longer be cultivable , " he says .
a replacement for kyoto in total , five rounds of preliminary talks will have been held by the time the copenhagen meeting roles around in december .
this third round of talks is intended as an ' informal meeting ' and is being held in bonn , as were the first two rounds . two further conferences are to be held in bangkok in september and october , and then in barcelona at the beginning of november .
the result of the last conference in bonn was a 300-page document with suggestions from the 192 negotiating countries .
the aim of this week 's meeting is to reduce the document to between 50 and 100 pages ; this will then form the basis of discussions in copenhagen .
suggestions abound ; commitments are scarce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests accompanied the last un climate talks in bonn despite the hundreds of pages of suggestions , solid commitments from un member nations have not been forthcoming .
disputes continue about who should do what and in what time frame .
there are also questions about who should provide financing for developing nations so that they can also combat the effects of climate change .
yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change , recently told the french news agency afp that the kyoto-replacement climate treaty would be crippled without strong commitments from developed nations and would " defeat the whole purpose of the copenhagen agreement . "
developed nations have been reluctant to agree to concrete commitments without the support of developing nations , especially china and india , two of the world 's fastest growing countries with the world 's two largest populations .
however , china and india say that their commitments should not be equal to those of wealthy countries because their populations are poorer and because they say their nations ' growth would be stilted by restrictions .

however environmentalists warn that previous climate commitments are way off the mark . delegations from 192 countries are meeting in bonn to continue negotiations towards a global climate deal , which is to be finalised at a much-anticipated un meeting in copenhagen in december .
at the recent g-8 summit in the earthquake-devastated italian town of l 'aquila , developed nations , including the us , promised to limit global warming to two degrees celsius by 2050 .
however , climate experts and environmental groups say even two degrees is far too high and would have cataclysmic consequences .
martin kaiser , who is representing the environmental group greenpeace at the un climate talks , says an increase of two degrees would probably result in the disappearance of the amazon rainforest .
" -lrb- two degrees -rrb- would mean that sea levels would rise by one meter , and it would also mean that much arable land would become so dry that it would no longer be cultivable , " he says .
a replacement for kyoto in total , five rounds of preliminary talks will have been held by the time the copenhagen meeting roles around in december .
this third round of talks is intended as an ' informal meeting ' and is being held in bonn , as were the first two rounds . two further conferences are to be held in bangkok in september and october , and then in barcelona at the beginning of november .
the result of the last conference in bonn was a 300-page document with suggestions from the 192 negotiating countries .
the aim of this week 's meeting is to reduce the document to between 50 and 100 pages ; this will then form the basis of discussions in copenhagen .
suggestions abound ; commitments are scarce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests accompanied the last un climate talks in bonn despite the hundreds of pages of suggestions , solid commitments from un member nations have not been forthcoming .
disputes continue about who should do what and in what time frame .
there are also questions about who should provide financing for developing nations so that they can also combat the effects of climate change .
yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change , recently told the french news agency afp that the kyoto-replacement climate treaty would be crippled without strong commitments from developed nations and would " defeat the whole purpose of the copenhagen agreement . "
developed nations have been reluctant to agree to concrete commitments without the support of developing nations , especially china and india , two of the world 's fastest growing countries with the world 's two largest populations .
however , china and india say that their commitments should not be equal to those of wealthy countries because their populations are poorer and because they say their nations ' growth would be stilted by restrictions .

bayreuth breaks protocol großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opera for the masses opera does n't have to be for the elite , but in bayreuth it always has been .
that the bayreuth festival is taking its wagner operas outside the festspielhaus is n't a novel idea , but it 's a big step for the green hill . some 22,000 people on sunday watched christoph marthaler 's production of the richard wagner opera " tristan and isolde . "
only one in 10 observed standard bayreuth protocol : evening gown and black tie . many of the rest were clad in shorts and sandals and had a cocktail or bratwurst in their hand .
unlike in the theater on the green hill , eating and drinking were permitted during the live broadcast of the performance on bayreuth 's central square . katharina wagner - the newly inaugurated co-director of the festival and great-granddaughter to the composer himself - initiated the public viewing last year and has said she wants to make it a bayreuth tradition . " opera is n't elitist ; it 's entertaining , " katharina wagner told reporters . with free entry and without having to spend years on the theater 's waiting list for tickets , the outdoor version is accessible to more opera fans .
those who watched the live-stream on their computers at home paid 14.90 euros -lrb- $ 21.10 -rrb- .
inside the festspielhaus , those lucky enough to get tickets can pay up to several hundred euros for them . granted , the sound quality outdoors can hardly compare with richard wagner 's specially designed theater .
however , the acoustic experienced was improved over last year 's debut broadcast - this time with 20 speakers running on 138,000 watts , according to the dpa news agency . seven cameras in the theater transported the singers to the 90-square-meter -lrb- 969-square-foot -rrb- led screen in the square .
the cast , with robert dean smith and irene theorin in the title roles , made a live appearance for their outdoor audience after the show . sunday 's broadcast was the second of its kind at this year 's bayreuth festival . author : kate bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three bomb blasts on mallorca are the latest attacks on the popular tourist destination .
while all signs point to the involvement of eta , authorities have not officially named the group over sunday 's bombings . to learn more about the eta and their strategies , deutsche welle interviewed professor paul heywood , an expert on the basque separatist group at the university of nottingham in the united kingdom .
dw : the authorities have yet to conclusively link eta to sunday 's three bomb blasts .
is there any doubt about their involvement ? paul heywood : it is almost certain this was the work of eta , they had released statements the day before about a series of previous attacks that had taken place in june and july and these latest attacks follow a very similar pattern , including two attacks on holiday resorts in the past .
from your knowledge of the way eta operates , would they have had an active cell on the island , or would they have sent in people from the mainland ?
they probably sent people in from the mainland .
now there was , of course , the assassination of two civil guards on the island in palmanova on 30th july and these bombs that went off yesterday -lrb- sunday ed . -rrb- were all on timer devices , so it is just possible that the cell which carried out the assassinations just over a week ago also planted the bombs , though it 's a long time for bombs to be on timer devices , it 's more likely that they 've still got some people on the island .
how successful have the spanish authorities been in the past in tracking down eta bombers ?
well there have been a lot of high profile arrests of eta leaders and there 's been in recent years much more effective collaboration with the french authorities , so that the french and the spanish police have worked together to capture some of the top eta leaders .
however one of the issues - it can hardly be overstressed with any organization like eta - is that they are not single organizations where there is one leadership and if you capture that leadership then the organization is undermined .
these organizations operate on the basis of numbers of different cells which operate according to different command structures within different parts of the country , and indeed , they are often characterized by splits within the organization , so eta , just like a lot of other terrorist organizations , has historically had splits between an official leadership - quite often wanting dialogue and political interaction with the government - and more militant , often younger members , who are against dialogue and want to continue the campaign of violence .
what is likely to be the impact on spain 's tourism industry ? that 's what they are aiming for - to hurt spain 's tourism industry - this is a form of economic terrorism .
the targets are not members of the public , still less actual tourists .
eta has a history of mainly targeting members of the spanish armed forces or police and recent assassinations which have taken place have been of members of the civil guard .
eta has never really gone for soft targets in the sense of members of the public or holidaymakers , tourists .
but what they do want to do to is to instil a sense of fear so that people think twice about whether they are going to visit spain on holiday and in that sense create an economic climate for the government , which of course is already struggling with the impact of recession , which makes it much more difficult for them .

three bomb blasts on mallorca are the latest attacks on the popular tourist destination .
while all signs point to the involvement of eta , authorities have not officially named the group over sunday 's bombings . to learn more about the eta and their strategies , deutsche welle interviewed professor paul heywood , an expert on the basque separatist group at the university of nottingham in the united kingdom .
dw : the authorities have yet to conclusively link eta to sunday 's three bomb blasts .
is there any doubt about their involvement ? paul heywood : it is almost certain this was the work of eta , they had released statements the day before about a series of previous attacks that had taken place in june and july and these latest attacks follow a very similar pattern , including two attacks on holiday resorts in the past .
from your knowledge of the way eta operates , would they have had an active cell on the island , or would they have sent in people from the mainland ?
they probably sent people in from the mainland .
now there was , of course , the assassination of two civil guards on the island in palmanova on 30th july and these bombs that went off yesterday -lrb- sunday ed . -rrb- were all on timer devices , so it is just possible that the cell which carried out the assassinations just over a week ago also planted the bombs , though it 's a long time for bombs to be on timer devices , it 's more likely that they 've still got some people on the island .
how successful have the spanish authorities been in the past in tracking down eta bombers ?
well there have been a lot of high profile arrests of eta leaders and there 's been in recent years much more effective collaboration with the french authorities , so that the french and the spanish police have worked together to capture some of the top eta leaders .
however one of the issues - it can hardly be overstressed with any organization like eta - is that they are not single organizations where there is one leadership and if you capture that leadership then the organization is undermined .
these organizations operate on the basis of numbers of different cells which operate according to different command structures within different parts of the country , and indeed , they are often characterized by splits within the organization , so eta , just like a lot of other terrorist organizations , has historically had splits between an official leadership - quite often wanting dialogue and political interaction with the government - and more militant , often younger members , who are against dialogue and want to continue the campaign of violence .
what is likely to be the impact on spain 's tourism industry ? that 's what they are aiming for - to hurt spain 's tourism industry - this is a form of economic terrorism .
the targets are not members of the public , still less actual tourists .
eta has a history of mainly targeting members of the spanish armed forces or police and recent assassinations which have taken place have been of members of the civil guard .
eta has never really gone for soft targets in the sense of members of the public or holidaymakers , tourists .
but what they do want to do to is to instil a sense of fear so that people think twice about whether they are going to visit spain on holiday and in that sense create an economic climate for the government , which of course is already struggling with the impact of recession , which makes it much more difficult for them .

the basque separatist group eta is believed to have been behind the attacks . spanish police officials said they were trying to determine the identities of the people behind the bomb blasts . the attacks are believed to have been carried out by the basque separatist group eta .
only a few clues had emerged on monday and authorities could not say whether the bombers were still on the island or if there was an eta terrorist cell on the island itself . it is also unclear whether sunday 's bombers were the same people responsible for a bomb attack that killed two policemen in july . spain 's king juan carlos has condemned the mallorca bombings saying the attacks would not succeed in damaging spain 's democracy . there is speculation that the attacks may have been meant to draw attention to eta ’ s cause rather than to harm people because all of the bombs contained low levels of explosives and were detonated after warnings had been given , giving the authorities time to clear people from the blast sites .
no injuries were reported . the first of sunday 's bombings occurred at a restaurant on the outskirts of palma de mallorca , near a recreational harbor along the road leading from the city center to the island 's airport .
the explosive was hidden in a backpack in one of the restaurant 's bathrooms . the second explosion came about two hours later in another restaurant about 500 meters -lrb- 546 yards -rrb- from the first .
the third came in a nearby underground supermarket shortly afterwards .
the shopping complex had already been sealed off by police . the origin of a fourth explosion - in a restaurant - was being investigated to find out whether it was a gas explosion or another bomb blast .
overnight police were searching for yet another suspected bomb in a hotel complex in palma de mallorca . bombings followed eta claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first two bombs exploded in restaurants while the third went off in a supermarket the attacks are another blow to the island 's tourism industry and came only hours after eta admitted it was behind bombings that claimed the lives of two civil guard officers and a police inspector and injured dozens more in june and july . the group did not initially claim responsibility for an attack in the mallorcan resort town of palmanova on july 30 , but confirmed in a statement in the basque newspaper , gara , on sunday that it had been behind the car bombing . the explosion killed two civil guard officers who had been driving the vehicle at the time . eta also said it was behind a car bombing in the basque city of bilbao in june which claimed the life of police inspector eduardo puelles garcia . the separatists said garcia had been " the chief of police operations against numerous leftist independence activists and against pro-independence youths for the past decades , and the coordinator of different operations against eta . " eta also said it was behind two other attacks , both in july .
one was a car bombing outside of a police barracks , which injured more than 40 people ; the other an attack on the governing socialist party 's offices in the basque town of durango . ai / mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

unasur was launched to promote integration among south american countries and as such has a number of initiatives at its heart which intend to consolidate trade , security and infrastructure policies across its member states .
among many of the initiatives set up at its creation , unasur aims to create a single market to eliminate the fees for non-sensitive products by 2014 and for sensitive products -lrb- i.e. , beef , dairy -rrb- by 2019 .
unasur is also pursuing an initiative for infrastructure integration of south america -lrb- iirsa -rrb- , including the construction of the inter-oceanic highway to link the pacific coast countries to allow better connections with bolivia , argentina , peru and brazil .
the presidency of unasur rotates on an annual basis , and is currently held by chilean president michelle bachelet .
the presidency will be handed to ecuador during the summit held in its capital .
the outcomes of the 2009 unasur summit are likely to have a wider significance outside of south america , with the european union and germany in particular interested in the bloc 's discussions .
as well as developments in trade relations , germany will be looking at the increased collaboration within unasur with a view to possible effects this may have on its bilateral relations .
germany 's interests feature heavily on trade out of the 12 unasur countries , germany is closest , in terms of trade and political dialogue , with brazil .
brazil is germany 's main trade partner in the unasur , with seven percent of brazilian imports coming from germany , making it brazil 's main trading partner in the eu , while five percent of brazilian exports come to germany , second only to the netherlands within the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and lula have a tight trading partnership " brazil is germany 's main partner within this country-group , " claudia zilla , a latin america expert with the americas research division at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" germany imports iron ore , auto parts , machinery , coffee , soy , animal feed , chemical products , oil , paper pulp , meat and metals from brazil .
brazil imports machinery , chemical products , auto parts , electro technology , and medicine from germany . "
zilla explained that , while trade - specifically with brazil - is an important part of germany 's involvement in south america , it is far from being its only commitment .
berlin sees opportunities to forge partnerships on a number of global issues with south american governments within unasur .
in terms of international development cooperation with south america , germany 's main partners in bilateral programs are peru , ecuador , colombia , brazil , and particularly bolivia .
partnerships pursued ; opportunities missed " besides investment and trade , germany is interested in global governance , " zilla said .
" in some policy areas like environment and energy , south american countries have high potential to become partners in global cooperation .
germany and south america share important values like multilateralism and peaceful conflict resolution .
but this does not mean both parts exploit these opportunities .
there is a lack of sustainable engagement and strategic coordination between both sides on an international level .
bildunterschrift : germany actively seeks cooperation with unasur members but opportunities are often squandered " democratic values are always an important component of germany 's partnership programs , of political dialogue and international economic cooperation , " she added .
" but it does not mean that the intensity of germany 's relationship with south american countries goes hand in hand with their democratic quality . "
" on the one hand , some cooperation with less democratic countries can be a valuable contribution to deeper democratization .
on the other hand , latin american democracies are not frozen political systems , but dynamic ones .
this makes things tough at times , as it is not easy to constantly adapt foreign relations to the changes in each country , " she said .
while common policies on tackling the effects of the global financial crisis and issues of trade and security are the main topics for the 2009 meeting , the summit is likely to be overshadowed by the row simmering between a number of unasur 's members over colombia 's plans to allow the united states use of seven military bases in its territory .
the official reason given for the us approach by alvaro uribe 's government is the fight against drug trafficking , which fuels the activities of leftist colombian rebels that have been fighting the state for more than 40 years .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , a long-time antagonist of uribe , has voiced strong opposition to colombia 's plans , and moved to freeze ties with bogota as well as recalling the venezuelan ambassador .
he considers the narcotics interdiction a pretense , and has accused the us of seeking to establish colombia as a " yankee " platform for attacks on other countries in latin america .
berlin unlikely to comment on us base plan for colombia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela and germany have a low-level relationship germany has a low-level relationship with venezuela and as such is highly unlikely to get involved in any spat over us influence in colombia .
venezuela 's trade dealings are focused on the united states while chavez 's foreign policy has a strong south-south-dimension , oriented toward his own region or toward non-eu countries like iran and russia .
" i can not imagine that germany would see anything wrong with -lrb- colombia 's plan -rrb- .
the us has had its own military base in manta for a long time , " said zilla .
" now the us is looking for alternatives after ecuador decided not to renew the lease on the base , it makes sense that -lrb- colombian president alvaro -rrb- uribe is willing to let the us use colombian bases . "
as is often the case , chavez is the most outspoken critic of us plans in latin america , but other leaders around the region have expressed reservations too after uribe toured seven south american countries to explain his plans last week .
brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva demanded formal guarantees that the planned deal between bogota and washington would not allow the use of colombian bases to launch actions on other countries in the region .
" it is essential to grant some kind of formal guarantee , a legal guarantee , that possible -lrb- us military -rrb- operations will happen strictly within colombian territory , " brazilian presidential spokesman marcelo baumbach stressed last friday .
" there is a suggestion for there to be greater transparency , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim had said earlier .
according to amorim , lula hopes all doubts can be dispelled " calmly , based on technical considerations " at the unasur summit .
lula stressed that he favors " bilateral and multilateral cooperation between south american nations to combat drug trafficking , without external interferences . "

it 's another blow to the local tourist industry , with many travelers already concerned about the large number of swine flu cases on the island .
a spokesperson from the german foreign ministry told deutsche welle that the ministry has updated its travel information to make tourists aware of the bombings , with tips such as trying to avoid large crowds .
however , the ministry has not issued a travel warning for mallorca and early indications are that the bombs have not caused tourists to cut short their summer breaks .
sybille zeuch from the german travel association says there is currently no suggestion that the bomb attacks will drive away the 170,000 german tourists now on mallorca .
" what is different from other terrorist attacks is that eta does not want to target tourists and no one has been hurt in these attacks , " zeuch told deutsche welle .
" eta wants to spread fear but they do n't want any victims ; what they want to target is the economy . "
the spanish government has remained defiant , saying the impact on tourism from the blasts will be minimal .
" eta has been trying to inflict damage on the spanish tourism industry for 30 years , " joan mesquida , spain 's state secretary for tourism , said in palma de mallorca on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cordoned off the can tere antoni beach in mallorca after they received bomb warnings allegedly from eta eta responsible ?
all three bombs were planted in ladies ' toilets , indicating that at least one of the attackers was a woman , however police have not yet been unable to formally identify those responsible .
indications are that basque separatist group eta was behind the blasts , after police received warnings earlier in the day that attacks would occur , from someone claiming to be from eta .
the group also admitted responsibility on sunday for a number of recent attacks , including a car bomb on mallorca just over a week ago that killed two civil guards .
thanks to the warnings , no one was hurt in the explosions .
the explosives were also not particularly powerful , leading authorities to believe that the attacks were intended only as a warning and not to cause injury .
authorities are investigating whether the bombs were set off with the use of timers , which would have allowed the devices to be planted several days in advance and given those responsible time to escape .

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 10.08.2009 percussionists are natural all-rounders , says young star grubinger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grubinger was born in salzburg in 1983 and is playing at this year 's festival there at just 26 , austrian percussionist martin grubinger 's concerts sell out around the world .
praised for his musical versatility , he told dw how all musical genres are linked - and what he 's going to do when he retires . martin grubinger has performed in some of the world 's top concert halls , including the koelner philharmonie , the concertgebouw in amsterdam and carnegie hall in new york .
he is currently active in the european summer music festival scene , playing at the salzburg festival in austria and at germany 's schleswig-holstein music festival , where he is an artist in residence . deutsche welle : you 're at home in practically every musical genre .
how did you become such a versatile musician ? martin grubinger : for us percussionists , there 's a logical connection between contemporary music and jazz .
or take salsa , samba , tango , funk , fusion , rock - all of these belong together for us percussionists .
every genre has a connection to all the others and percussion is at home in all these areas . was exactly is the connection between jazz and contemporary music ? contemporary music has a lot to do with percussion because the composers today use a lot of different percussion instruments in their works .
they 're discovering the instrument , both in solo and orchestral contexts - there 's always quite a lot of percussion in contemporary compositions .
without percussion , the music would n't work - without the rhythm and the stringency . can you describe the different challenges that jazz and contemporary music involve ? yes , of course these different types of music have to be approached differently .
with jazz , you are creative and you can do a lot - every evening is different .
in contemporary music , it 's important to the composers that you stay true to the score and actually play what 's written .
that 's crucial because the composers have something particular in mind . if i were to improvise a work by iannis xenakis , for example , it would be a scandal , a falsification .
it would totally miss the composer 's idea .
xenakis mathematically calculates the relationship between the instruments .
that means if you do n't play exactly what 's in the score , the result would be total chaos . with jazz , it 's completely different .
there , you just have to stay within the meter and the harmonies and otherwise you 're pretty much free . bildunterschrift : without percussion , contemporary music would n't work , says grubinger this year , you 're an artist in residence at the schleswig-holstein music festival , where you 've given a wide variety of workshops and concerts and with diverse programs .
all of your concerts were sold out , which earned you the label " audience magnet . " yes , it 's actually really funny .
for us musicians , things happen via friendships and connections .
you hear people when you 're on tour - you sit in concerts and think , he has to play with my ensemble , i want to work with him ! in our case , we 're in a position to bring a big audience into the concert hall , so of course the good musicians want to play with us .
that 's a big advantage , because that way we can gain a lot of quality and expertise in very different areas . the other musicians who work with you have said they really enjoy it .
is there a reciprocal effect with the members of your ensemble ? it 's unbelievable what you can learn on such an evening , you 're sensitized to entirely new things .
as a percussionist , you work in one direction , then there 's a violinist who has a completely different idea of how things should sound and a much bigger palette of colors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 10.08.2009 all signs point to eta , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor paul heywood believes that eta is not a monolithic organisation .
three bomb blasts on mallorca are the latest attacks on the popular tourist destination .
while all signs point to the involvement of eta , authorities have not officially named the group over sunday 's bombings . to learn more about the eta and their strategies , deutsche welle interviewed professor paul heywood , an expert on the basque separatist group at the university of nottingham in the united kingdom .
dw : the authorities have yet to conclusively link eta to sunday 's three bomb blasts .
is there any doubt about their involvement ? paul heywood : it is almost certain this was the work of eta , they had released statements the day before about a series of previous attacks that had taken place in june and july and these latest attacks follow a very similar pattern , including two attacks on holiday resorts in the past .
from your knowledge of the way eta operates , would they have had an active cell on the island , or would they have sent in people from the mainland ?
they probably sent people in from the mainland .
now there was , of course , the assassination of two civil guards on the island in palmanova on 30th july and these bombs that went off yesterday -lrb- sunday ed . -rrb- were all on timer devices , so it is just possible that the cell which carried out the assassinations just over a week ago also planted the bombs , though it 's a long time for bombs to be on timer devices , it 's more likely that they 've still got some people on the island .
how successful have the spanish authorities been in the past in tracking down eta bombers ?
well there have been a lot of high profile arrests of eta leaders and there 's been in recent years much more effective collaboration with the french authorities , so that the french and the spanish police have worked together to capture some of the top eta leaders .
however one of the issues - it can hardly be overstressed with any organization like eta - is that they are not single organizations where there is one leadership and if you capture that leadership then the organization is undermined .
these organizations operate on the basis of numbers of different cells which operate according to different command structures within different parts of the country , and indeed , they are often characterized by splits within the organization , so eta , just like a lot of other terrorist organizations , has historically had splits between an official leadership - quite often wanting dialogue and political interaction with the government - and more militant , often younger members , who are against dialogue and want to continue the campaign of violence .
what is likely to be the impact on spain 's tourism industry ? that 's what they are aiming for - to hurt spain 's tourism industry - this is a form of economic terrorism .
the targets are not members of the public , still less actual tourists .
eta has a history of mainly targeting members of the spanish armed forces or police and recent assassinations which have taken place have been of members of the civil guard .
eta has never really gone for soft targets in the sense of members of the public or holidaymakers , tourists .
but what they do want to do to is to instil a sense of fear so that people think twice about whether they are going to visit spain on holiday and in that sense create an economic climate for the government , which of course is already struggling with the impact of recession , which makes it much more difficult for them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 10.08.2009 spanish police search for suspected eta bombers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta appears to be stepping up its bombing campaign spanish police are searching for suspects behind a number of bomb blasts on the spanish island of mallorca on sunday .
the basque separatist group eta is believed to have been behind the attacks . spanish police officials said they were trying to determine the identities of the people behind the bomb blasts . the attacks are believed to have been carried out by the basque separatist group eta .
only a few clues had emerged on monday and authorities could not say whether the bombers were still on the island or if there was an eta terrorist cell on the island itself . it is also unclear whether sunday 's bombers were the same people responsible for a bomb attack that killed two policemen in july . spain 's king juan carlos has condemned the mallorca bombings saying the attacks would not succeed in damaging spain 's democracy . there is speculation that the attacks may have been meant to draw attention to eta ’ s cause rather than to harm people because all of the bombs contained low levels of explosives and were detonated after warnings had been given , giving the authorities time to clear people from the blast sites .
no injuries were reported . the first of sunday 's bombings occurred at a restaurant on the outskirts of palma de mallorca , near a recreational harbor along the road leading from the city center to the island 's airport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 10.08.2009 un delegates continue battle over climate commitments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists warn that melting glaciers have already caused seas to rise delegates are meeting in bonn for the latest round of climate talks in the lead-up to a major conference in copenhagen in december .
however environmentalists warn that previous climate commitments are way off the mark . delegations from 192 countries are meeting in bonn to continue negotiations towards a global climate deal , which is to be finalised at a much-anticipated un meeting in copenhagen in december .
at the recent g-8 summit in the earthquake-devastated italian town of l 'aquila , developed nations , including the us , promised to limit global warming to two degrees celsius by 2050 .
however , climate experts and environmental groups say even two degrees is far too high and would have cataclysmic consequences .
martin kaiser , who is representing the environmental group greenpeace at the un climate talks , says an increase of two degrees would probably result in the disappearance of the amazon rainforest .
" -lrb- two degrees -rrb- would mean that sea levels would rise by one meter , and it would also mean that much arable land would become so dry that it would no longer be cultivable , " he says .
a replacement for kyoto in total , five rounds of preliminary talks will have been held by the time the copenhagen meeting roles around in december .
this third round of talks is intended as an ' informal meeting ' and is being held in bonn , as were the first two rounds . two further conferences are to be held in bangkok in september and october , and then in barcelona at the beginning of november .
the result of the last conference in bonn was a 300-page document with suggestions from the 192 negotiating countries .
the aim of this week 's meeting is to reduce the document to between 50 and 100 pages ; this will then form the basis of discussions in copenhagen .
suggestions abound ; commitments are scarce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests accompanied the last un climate talks in bonn despite the hundreds of pages of suggestions , solid commitments from un member nations have not been forthcoming .
disputes continue about who should do what and in what time frame .
there are also questions about who should provide financing for developing nations so that they can also combat the effects of climate change .
yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change , recently told the french news agency afp that the kyoto-replacement climate treaty would be crippled without strong commitments from developed nations and would " defeat the whole purpose of the copenhagen agreement . "
developed nations have been reluctant to agree to concrete commitments without the support of developing nations , especially china and india , two of the world 's fastest growing countries with the world 's two largest populations .
however , china and india say that their commitments should not be equal to those of wealthy countries because their populations are poorer and because they say their nations ' growth would be stilted by restrictions .

however environmentalists warn that previous climate commitments are way off the mark . delegations from 192 countries are meeting in bonn to continue negotiations towards a global climate deal , which is to be finalised at a much-anticipated un meeting in copenhagen in december .
at the recent g-8 summit in the earthquake-devastated italian town of l 'aquila , developed nations , including the us , promised to limit global warming to two degrees celsius by 2050 .
however , climate experts and environmental groups say even two degrees is far too high and would have cataclysmic consequences .
martin kaiser , who is representing the environmental group greenpeace at the un climate talks , says an increase of two degrees would probably result in the disappearance of the amazon rainforest .
" -lrb- two degrees -rrb- would mean that sea levels would rise by one meter , and it would also mean that much arable land would become so dry that it would no longer be cultivable , " he says .
a replacement for kyoto in total , five rounds of preliminary talks will have been held by the time the copenhagen meeting roles around in december .
this third round of talks is intended as an ' informal meeting ' and is being held in bonn , as were the first two rounds . two further conferences are to be held in bangkok in september and october , and then in barcelona at the beginning of november .
the result of the last conference in bonn was a 300-page document with suggestions from the 192 negotiating countries .
the aim of this week 's meeting is to reduce the document to between 50 and 100 pages ; this will then form the basis of discussions in copenhagen .
suggestions abound ; commitments are scarce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests accompanied the last un climate talks in bonn despite the hundreds of pages of suggestions , solid commitments from un member nations have not been forthcoming .
disputes continue about who should do what and in what time frame .
there are also questions about who should provide financing for developing nations so that they can also combat the effects of climate change .
yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change , recently told the french news agency afp that the kyoto-replacement climate treaty would be crippled without strong commitments from developed nations and would " defeat the whole purpose of the copenhagen agreement . "
developed nations have been reluctant to agree to concrete commitments without the support of developing nations , especially china and india , two of the world 's fastest growing countries with the world 's two largest populations .
however , china and india say that their commitments should not be equal to those of wealthy countries because their populations are poorer and because they say their nations ' growth would be stilted by restrictions .

bayreuth breaks protocol großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opera for the masses opera does n't have to be for the elite , but in bayreuth it always has been .
that the bayreuth festival is taking its wagner operas outside the festspielhaus is n't a novel idea , but it 's a big step for the green hill . some 22,000 people on sunday watched christoph marthaler 's production of the richard wagner opera " tristan and isolde . "
only one in 10 observed standard bayreuth protocol : evening gown and black tie . many of the rest were clad in shorts and sandals and had a cocktail or bratwurst in their hand .
unlike in the theater on the green hill , eating and drinking were permitted during the live broadcast of the performance on bayreuth 's central square . katharina wagner - the newly inaugurated co-director of the festival and great-granddaughter to the composer himself - initiated the public viewing last year and has said she wants to make it a bayreuth tradition . " opera is n't elitist ; it 's entertaining , " katharina wagner told reporters . with free entry and without having to spend years on the theater 's waiting list for tickets , the outdoor version is accessible to more opera fans .
those who watched the live-stream on their computers at home paid 14.90 euros -lrb- $ 21.10 -rrb- .
inside the festspielhaus , those lucky enough to get tickets can pay up to several hundred euros for them . granted , the sound quality outdoors can hardly compare with richard wagner 's specially designed theater .
however , the acoustic experienced was improved over last year 's debut broadcast - this time with 20 speakers running on 138,000 watts , according to the dpa news agency . seven cameras in the theater transported the singers to the 90-square-meter -lrb- 969-square-foot -rrb- led screen in the square .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 10.08.2009 international partners watch south american summit with interest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 12-nation unasur meets to discuss common issues the summit of the union of south american nations -lrb- unasur -rrb- in quito , ecuador brought together the heads of state of the 12-member bloc to discuss the economic crisis , regional security and other common issues . unasur was set up in 2008 , bringing together argentina , bolivia , brazil , chile , colombia , ecuador , guyana , paraguay , peru , suriname , uruguay and venezuela in a new union after its predecessor , the south american community of nations -lrb- csn -rrb- , became defunct in 2007 .
unasur was launched to promote integration among south american countries and as such has a number of initiatives at its heart which intend to consolidate trade , security and infrastructure policies across its member states .
among many of the initiatives set up at its creation , unasur aims to create a single market to eliminate the fees for non-sensitive products by 2014 and for sensitive products -lrb- i.e. , beef , dairy -rrb- by 2019 .
unasur is also pursuing an initiative for infrastructure integration of south america -lrb- iirsa -rrb- , including the construction of the inter-oceanic highway to link the pacific coast countries to allow better connections with bolivia , argentina , peru and brazil .
the presidency of unasur rotates on an annual basis , and is currently held by chilean president michelle bachelet .
the presidency will be handed to ecuador during the summit held in its capital .
the outcomes of the 2009 unasur summit are likely to have a wider significance outside of south america , with the european union and germany in particular interested in the bloc 's discussions .
as well as developments in trade relations , germany will be looking at the increased collaboration within unasur with a view to possible effects this may have on its bilateral relations .
germany 's interests feature heavily on trade out of the 12 unasur countries , germany is closest , in terms of trade and political dialogue , with brazil .
brazil is germany 's main trade partner in the unasur , with seven percent of brazilian imports coming from germany , making it brazil 's main trading partner in the eu , while five percent of brazilian exports come to germany , second only to the netherlands within the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and lula have a tight trading partnership " brazil is germany 's main partner within this country-group , " claudia zilla , a latin america expert with the americas research division at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" germany imports iron ore , auto parts , machinery , coffee , soy , animal feed , chemical products , oil , paper pulp , meat and metals from brazil .
brazil imports machinery , chemical products , auto parts , electro technology , and medicine from germany . "
zilla explained that , while trade - specifically with brazil - is an important part of germany 's involvement in south america , it is far from being its only commitment .
berlin sees opportunities to forge partnerships on a number of global issues with south american governments within unasur .
in terms of international development cooperation with south america , germany 's main partners in bilateral programs are peru , ecuador , colombia , brazil , and particularly bolivia .
partnerships pursued ; opportunities missed " besides investment and trade , germany is interested in global governance , " zilla said .
" in some policy areas like environment and energy , south american countries have high potential to become partners in global cooperation .
germany and south america share important values like multilateralism and peaceful conflict resolution .
but this does not mean both parts exploit these opportunities .
there is a lack of sustainable engagement and strategic coordination between both sides on an international level .
bildunterschrift : germany actively seeks cooperation with unasur members but opportunities are often squandered " democratic values are always an important component of germany 's partnership programs , of political dialogue and international economic cooperation , " she added .
" but it does not mean that the intensity of germany 's relationship with south american countries goes hand in hand with their democratic quality . "
" on the one hand , some cooperation with less democratic countries can be a valuable contribution to deeper democratization .
on the other hand , latin american democracies are not frozen political systems , but dynamic ones .
this makes things tough at times , as it is not easy to constantly adapt foreign relations to the changes in each country , " she said .
while common policies on tackling the effects of the global financial crisis and issues of trade and security are the main topics for the 2009 meeting , the summit is likely to be overshadowed by the row simmering between a number of unasur 's members over colombia 's plans to allow the united states use of seven military bases in its territory .
the official reason given for the us approach by alvaro uribe 's government is the fight against drug trafficking , which fuels the activities of leftist colombian rebels that have been fighting the state for more than 40 years .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , a long-time antagonist of uribe , has voiced strong opposition to colombia 's plans , and moved to freeze ties with bogota as well as recalling the venezuelan ambassador .
he considers the narcotics interdiction a pretense , and has accused the us of seeking to establish colombia as a " yankee " platform for attacks on other countries in latin america .
berlin unlikely to comment on us base plan for colombia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela and germany have a low-level relationship germany has a low-level relationship with venezuela and as such is highly unlikely to get involved in any spat over us influence in colombia .
venezuela 's trade dealings are focused on the united states while chavez 's foreign policy has a strong south-south-dimension , oriented toward his own region or toward non-eu countries like iran and russia .
" i can not imagine that germany would see anything wrong with -lrb- colombia 's plan -rrb- .
the us has had its own military base in manta for a long time , " said zilla .
" now the us is looking for alternatives after ecuador decided not to renew the lease on the base , it makes sense that -lrb- colombian president alvaro -rrb- uribe is willing to let the us use colombian bases . "
as is often the case , chavez is the most outspoken critic of us plans in latin america , but other leaders around the region have expressed reservations too after uribe toured seven south american countries to explain his plans last week .
brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva demanded formal guarantees that the planned deal between bogota and washington would not allow the use of colombian bases to launch actions on other countries in the region .
" it is essential to grant some kind of formal guarantee , a legal guarantee , that possible -lrb- us military -rrb- operations will happen strictly within colombian territory , " brazilian presidential spokesman marcelo baumbach stressed last friday .
" there is a suggestion for there to be greater transparency , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim had said earlier .
according to amorim , lula hopes all doubts can be dispelled " calmly , based on technical considerations " at the unasur summit .
lula stressed that he favors " bilateral and multilateral cooperation between south american nations to combat drug trafficking , without external interferences . "

unasur was launched to promote integration among south american countries and as such has a number of initiatives at its heart which intend to consolidate trade , security and infrastructure policies across its member states .
among many of the initiatives set up at its creation , unasur aims to create a single market to eliminate the fees for non-sensitive products by 2014 and for sensitive products -lrb- i.e. , beef , dairy -rrb- by 2019 .
unasur is also pursuing an initiative for infrastructure integration of south america -lrb- iirsa -rrb- , including the construction of the inter-oceanic highway to link the pacific coast countries to allow better connections with bolivia , argentina , peru and brazil .
the presidency of unasur rotates on an annual basis , and is currently held by chilean president michelle bachelet .
the presidency will be handed to ecuador during the summit held in its capital .
the outcomes of the 2009 unasur summit are likely to have a wider significance outside of south america , with the european union and germany in particular interested in the bloc 's discussions .
as well as developments in trade relations , germany will be looking at the increased collaboration within unasur with a view to possible effects this may have on its bilateral relations .
germany 's interests feature heavily on trade out of the 12 unasur countries , germany is closest , in terms of trade and political dialogue , with brazil .
brazil is germany 's main trade partner in the unasur , with seven percent of brazilian imports coming from germany , making it brazil 's main trading partner in the eu , while five percent of brazilian exports come to germany , second only to the netherlands within the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and lula have a tight trading partnership " brazil is germany 's main partner within this country-group , " claudia zilla , a latin america expert with the americas research division at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" germany imports iron ore , auto parts , machinery , coffee , soy , animal feed , chemical products , oil , paper pulp , meat and metals from brazil .
brazil imports machinery , chemical products , auto parts , electro technology , and medicine from germany . "
zilla explained that , while trade - specifically with brazil - is an important part of germany 's involvement in south america , it is far from being its only commitment .
berlin sees opportunities to forge partnerships on a number of global issues with south american governments within unasur .
in terms of international development cooperation with south america , germany 's main partners in bilateral programs are peru , ecuador , colombia , brazil , and particularly bolivia .
partnerships pursued ; opportunities missed " besides investment and trade , germany is interested in global governance , " zilla said .
" in some policy areas like environment and energy , south american countries have high potential to become partners in global cooperation .
germany and south america share important values like multilateralism and peaceful conflict resolution .
but this does not mean both parts exploit these opportunities .
there is a lack of sustainable engagement and strategic coordination between both sides on an international level .
bildunterschrift : germany actively seeks cooperation with unasur members but opportunities are often squandered " democratic values are always an important component of germany 's partnership programs , of political dialogue and international economic cooperation , " she added .
" but it does not mean that the intensity of germany 's relationship with south american countries goes hand in hand with their democratic quality . "
" on the one hand , some cooperation with less democratic countries can be a valuable contribution to deeper democratization .
on the other hand , latin american democracies are not frozen political systems , but dynamic ones .
this makes things tough at times , as it is not easy to constantly adapt foreign relations to the changes in each country , " she said .
while common policies on tackling the effects of the global financial crisis and issues of trade and security are the main topics for the 2009 meeting , the summit is likely to be overshadowed by the row simmering between a number of unasur 's members over colombia 's plans to allow the united states use of seven military bases in its territory .
the official reason given for the us approach by alvaro uribe 's government is the fight against drug trafficking , which fuels the activities of leftist colombian rebels that have been fighting the state for more than 40 years .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , a long-time antagonist of uribe , has voiced strong opposition to colombia 's plans , and moved to freeze ties with bogota as well as recalling the venezuelan ambassador .
he considers the narcotics interdiction a pretense , and has accused the us of seeking to establish colombia as a " yankee " platform for attacks on other countries in latin america .
berlin unlikely to comment on us base plan for colombia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela and germany have a low-level relationship germany has a low-level relationship with venezuela and as such is highly unlikely to get involved in any spat over us influence in colombia .
venezuela 's trade dealings are focused on the united states while chavez 's foreign policy has a strong south-south-dimension , oriented toward his own region or toward non-eu countries like iran and russia .
" i can not imagine that germany would see anything wrong with -lrb- colombia 's plan -rrb- .
the us has had its own military base in manta for a long time , " said zilla .
" now the us is looking for alternatives after ecuador decided not to renew the lease on the base , it makes sense that -lrb- colombian president alvaro -rrb- uribe is willing to let the us use colombian bases . "
as is often the case , chavez is the most outspoken critic of us plans in latin america , but other leaders around the region have expressed reservations too after uribe toured seven south american countries to explain his plans last week .
brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva demanded formal guarantees that the planned deal between bogota and washington would not allow the use of colombian bases to launch actions on other countries in the region .
" it is essential to grant some kind of formal guarantee , a legal guarantee , that possible -lrb- us military -rrb- operations will happen strictly within colombian territory , " brazilian presidential spokesman marcelo baumbach stressed last friday .
" there is a suggestion for there to be greater transparency , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim had said earlier .
according to amorim , lula hopes all doubts can be dispelled " calmly , based on technical considerations " at the unasur summit .
lula stressed that he favors " bilateral and multilateral cooperation between south american nations to combat drug trafficking , without external interferences . "

it 's another blow to the local tourist industry , with many travelers already concerned about the large number of swine flu cases on the island .
a spokesperson from the german foreign ministry told deutsche welle that the ministry has updated its travel information to make tourists aware of the bombings , with tips such as trying to avoid large crowds .
however , the ministry has not issued a travel warning for mallorca and early indications are that the bombs have not caused tourists to cut short their summer breaks .
sybille zeuch from the german travel association says there is currently no suggestion that the bomb attacks will drive away the 170,000 german tourists now on mallorca .
" what is different from other terrorist attacks is that eta does not want to target tourists and no one has been hurt in these attacks , " zeuch told deutsche welle .
" eta wants to spread fear but they do n't want any victims ; what they want to target is the economy . "
the spanish government has remained defiant , saying the impact on tourism from the blasts will be minimal .
" eta has been trying to inflict damage on the spanish tourism industry for 30 years , " joan mesquida , spain 's state secretary for tourism , said in palma de mallorca on monday .

indications are that basque separatist group eta was behind the blasts , after police received warnings earlier in the day that attacks would occur , from someone claiming to be from eta .
the group also admitted responsibility on sunday for a number of recent attacks , including a car bomb on mallorca just over a week ago that killed two civil guards .
thanks to the warnings , no one was hurt in the explosions .
the explosives were also not particularly powerful , leading authorities to believe that the attacks were intended only as a warning and not to cause injury .

praised for his musical versatility , he told dw how all musical genres are linked - and what he 's going to do when he retires . martin grubinger has performed in some of the world 's top concert halls , including the koelner philharmonie , the concertgebouw in amsterdam and carnegie hall in new york .
he is currently active in the european summer music festival scene , playing at the salzburg festival in austria and at germany 's schleswig-holstein music festival , where he is an artist in residence . deutsche welle : you 're at home in practically every musical genre .
how did you become such a versatile musician ? martin grubinger : for us percussionists , there 's a logical connection between contemporary music and jazz .
or take salsa , samba , tango , funk , fusion , rock - all of these belong together for us percussionists .
every genre has a connection to all the others and percussion is at home in all these areas . was exactly is the connection between jazz and contemporary music ? contemporary music has a lot to do with percussion because the composers today use a lot of different percussion instruments in their works .
they 're discovering the instrument , both in solo and orchestral contexts - there 's always quite a lot of percussion in contemporary compositions .
without percussion , the music would n't work - without the rhythm and the stringency . can you describe the different challenges that jazz and contemporary music involve ? yes , of course these different types of music have to be approached differently .
with jazz , you are creative and you can do a lot - every evening is different .
in contemporary music , it 's important to the composers that you stay true to the score and actually play what 's written .
that 's crucial because the composers have something particular in mind . if i were to improvise a work by iannis xenakis , for example , it would be a scandal , a falsification .
it would totally miss the composer 's idea .
xenakis mathematically calculates the relationship between the instruments .
that means if you do n't play exactly what 's in the score , the result would be total chaos . with jazz , it 's completely different .
there , you just have to stay within the meter and the harmonies and otherwise you 're pretty much free . bildunterschrift : without percussion , contemporary music would n't work , says grubinger this year , you 're an artist in residence at the schleswig-holstein music festival , where you 've given a wide variety of workshops and concerts and with diverse programs .
all of your concerts were sold out , which earned you the label " audience magnet . " yes , it 's actually really funny .
for us musicians , things happen via friendships and connections .
you hear people when you 're on tour - you sit in concerts and think , he has to play with my ensemble , i want to work with him ! in our case , we 're in a position to bring a big audience into the concert hall , so of course the good musicians want to play with us .
that 's a big advantage , because that way we can gain a lot of quality and expertise in very different areas . the other musicians who work with you have said they really enjoy it .
is there a reciprocal effect with the members of your ensemble ? it 's unbelievable what you can learn on such an evening , you 're sensitized to entirely new things .
as a percussionist , you work in one direction , then there 's a violinist who has a completely different idea of how things should sound and a much bigger palette of colors .
he has a different idea of phrasing and rhythm , and an entirely different perspective on music .
it 's important , then , to learn to say , i want to watch out for those things too . you once said you work with a sports medicine specialist to be able to perform at 100 percent capacity even when your pulse is running at an average of 160 beats per minute during a concert .
you always perform from memory - do you ever have time to relax ? i 'm passionate about cycling and can relax really well when i 'm doing that , or when i 'm playing or watching soccer .
i like to read about socio-political things and i love history .
when i stop playing percussion , i want to study history . interview : magdalene melchers -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

praised for his musical versatility , he told dw how all musical genres are linked - and what he 's going to do when he retires . martin grubinger has performed in some of the world 's top concert halls , including the koelner philharmonie , the concertgebouw in amsterdam and carnegie hall in new york .
he is currently active in the european summer music festival scene , playing at the salzburg festival in austria and at germany 's schleswig-holstein music festival , where he is an artist in residence . deutsche welle : you 're at home in practically every musical genre .
how did you become such a versatile musician ? martin grubinger : for us percussionists , there 's a logical connection between contemporary music and jazz .
or take salsa , samba , tango , funk , fusion , rock - all of these belong together for us percussionists .
every genre has a connection to all the others and percussion is at home in all these areas . was exactly is the connection between jazz and contemporary music ? contemporary music has a lot to do with percussion because the composers today use a lot of different percussion instruments in their works .
they 're discovering the instrument , both in solo and orchestral contexts - there 's always quite a lot of percussion in contemporary compositions .
without percussion , the music would n't work - without the rhythm and the stringency . can you describe the different challenges that jazz and contemporary music involve ? yes , of course these different types of music have to be approached differently .
with jazz , you are creative and you can do a lot - every evening is different .
in contemporary music , it 's important to the composers that you stay true to the score and actually play what 's written .
that 's crucial because the composers have something particular in mind . if i were to improvise a work by iannis xenakis , for example , it would be a scandal , a falsification .
it would totally miss the composer 's idea .
xenakis mathematically calculates the relationship between the instruments .
that means if you do n't play exactly what 's in the score , the result would be total chaos . with jazz , it 's completely different .
there , you just have to stay within the meter and the harmonies and otherwise you 're pretty much free . bildunterschrift : without percussion , contemporary music would n't work , says grubinger this year , you 're an artist in residence at the schleswig-holstein music festival , where you 've given a wide variety of workshops and concerts and with diverse programs .

for us musicians , things happen via friendships and connections .
you hear people when you 're on tour - you sit in concerts and think , he has to play with my ensemble , i want to work with him ! in our case , we 're in a position to bring a big audience into the concert hall , so of course the good musicians want to play with us .
that 's a big advantage , because that way we can gain a lot of quality and expertise in very different areas . the other musicians who work with you have said they really enjoy it .
is there a reciprocal effect with the members of your ensemble ? it 's unbelievable what you can learn on such an evening , you 're sensitized to entirely new things .

praised for his musical versatility , he told dw how all musical genres are linked - and what he 's going to do when he retires . martin grubinger has performed in some of the world 's top concert halls , including the koelner philharmonie , the concertgebouw in amsterdam and carnegie hall in new york .
he is currently active in the european summer music festival scene , playing at the salzburg festival in austria and at germany 's schleswig-holstein music festival , where he is an artist in residence . deutsche welle : you 're at home in practically every musical genre .
how did you become such a versatile musician ? martin grubinger : for us percussionists , there 's a logical connection between contemporary music and jazz .
or take salsa , samba , tango , funk , fusion , rock - all of these belong together for us percussionists .
every genre has a connection to all the others and percussion is at home in all these areas . was exactly is the connection between jazz and contemporary music ? contemporary music has a lot to do with percussion because the composers today use a lot of different percussion instruments in their works .
they 're discovering the instrument , both in solo and orchestral contexts - there 's always quite a lot of percussion in contemporary compositions .
without percussion , the music would n't work - without the rhythm and the stringency . can you describe the different challenges that jazz and contemporary music involve ? yes , of course these different types of music have to be approached differently .
with jazz , you are creative and you can do a lot - every evening is different .
in contemporary music , it 's important to the composers that you stay true to the score and actually play what 's written .
that 's crucial because the composers have something particular in mind . if i were to improvise a work by iannis xenakis , for example , it would be a scandal , a falsification .
it would totally miss the composer 's idea .
xenakis mathematically calculates the relationship between the instruments .
that means if you do n't play exactly what 's in the score , the result would be total chaos . with jazz , it 's completely different .
there , you just have to stay within the meter and the harmonies and otherwise you 're pretty much free . bildunterschrift : without percussion , contemporary music would n't work , says grubinger this year , you 're an artist in residence at the schleswig-holstein music festival , where you 've given a wide variety of workshops and concerts and with diverse programs .
all of your concerts were sold out , which earned you the label " audience magnet . " yes , it 's actually really funny .
for us musicians , things happen via friendships and connections .
you hear people when you 're on tour - you sit in concerts and think , he has to play with my ensemble , i want to work with him ! in our case , we 're in a position to bring a big audience into the concert hall , so of course the good musicians want to play with us .
that 's a big advantage , because that way we can gain a lot of quality and expertise in very different areas . the other musicians who work with you have said they really enjoy it .
is there a reciprocal effect with the members of your ensemble ? it 's unbelievable what you can learn on such an evening , you 're sensitized to entirely new things .
as a percussionist , you work in one direction , then there 's a violinist who has a completely different idea of how things should sound and a much bigger palette of colors .
he has a different idea of phrasing and rhythm , and an entirely different perspective on music .
it 's important , then , to learn to say , i want to watch out for those things too . you once said you work with a sports medicine specialist to be able to perform at 100 percent capacity even when your pulse is running at an average of 160 beats per minute during a concert .
you always perform from memory - do you ever have time to relax ? i 'm passionate about cycling and can relax really well when i 'm doing that , or when i 'm playing or watching soccer .
i like to read about socio-political things and i love history .
when i stop playing percussion , i want to study history . interview : magdalene melchers -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

the confessions are expected to shorten the trial of the four men . in his wide-ranging confession , suspected ring leader fritz gelowicz told the court how the group 's plans for a terror attack in germany developed .
according to his confession in a duesseldorf court , the alleged mastermind of the group took part in a three-month terrorist training camp in pakistan in 2006 .
there , a plot was hatched to attack american targets , particularly military personnel , in germany .
part of the training dealt with weapons , such as kalashnikov machine guns , and the suspects were also reportedly trained in explosives and circuitry for bomb making .
prosecution lawyer volker brinkmann said ahead of the trial that the suspects had admitted to their goal of " killing as many americans as possible . "
unprecedented confessions the members of the so-called sauerland terror cell have been questioned by police for the past four weeks since the court adjourned for its summer recess .
their written testimonies now run to over 1,500 pages .
the confessions are more extensive than expected and they are likely to speed up the trial and reduce the sentences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presiding judge ottmar breidling called the wide-ranging confessions " impressive " chief judge ottmar breidling said the questioning during the four-week break had revealed an unexpectedly " impressive " range of information .
international security expert michael lueders says the confessions could significantly reduce the length of the trial .
" in the beginning , there was talk of two years for this process , but now people talk about three or four months , " lueders told deutsche welle .
this is one of the biggest terrorism trials in germany since those involving the urban guerrillas of the red army faction in the 1970s .
suspects accused of planning massive attacks the men allegedly formed their terror cell for the islamic jihad union and stand accused of plotting at least three bomb attacks in german cities targeting us citizens .
authorities say the group aimed to carry out attacks as deadly as those of september 11 , 2001 which killed around 3,000 people in the united states .
two of the suspects , gelowicz and daniel schneider , aged 29 and 23 respectively , are german converts to islam .
a third suspect , attila selek , is a 24-year-old german citizen of turkish origin , while 30-year-old adem yilmaz is a turkish national .

selek was later caught in turkey .
although the men were apprehended before any attacks took place , the fact that such ' home grown ' terrorists may pose a real threat in germany is a major cause for concern , says international security expert michael lueders .
" not everyone who converts to islam is radical , but some people are , and this is really a room for concern for most security analysts in germany , " said lueders , " and nobody really knows how to solve this issue .
so these so-called converts are really targeted by police . "

the confessions are expected to shorten the trial of the four men . in his wide-ranging confession , suspected ring leader fritz gelowicz told the court how the group 's plans for a terror attack in germany developed .
according to his confession in a duesseldorf court , the alleged mastermind of the group took part in a three-month terrorist training camp in pakistan in 2006 .
there , a plot was hatched to attack american targets , particularly military personnel , in germany .
part of the training dealt with weapons , such as kalashnikov machine guns , and the suspects were also reportedly trained in explosives and circuitry for bomb making .
prosecution lawyer volker brinkmann said ahead of the trial that the suspects had admitted to their goal of " killing as many americans as possible . "
unprecedented confessions the members of the so-called sauerland terror cell have been questioned by police for the past four weeks since the court adjourned for its summer recess .
their written testimonies now run to over 1,500 pages .

" in the beginning , there was talk of two years for this process , but now people talk about three or four months , " lueders told deutsche welle .
this is one of the biggest terrorism trials in germany since those involving the urban guerrillas of the red army faction in the 1970s .
suspects accused of planning massive attacks the men allegedly formed their terror cell for the islamic jihad union and stand accused of plotting at least three bomb attacks in german cities targeting us citizens .
authorities say the group aimed to carry out attacks as deadly as those of september 11 , 2001 which killed around 3,000 people in the united states .
two of the suspects , gelowicz and daniel schneider , aged 29 and 23 respectively , are german converts to islam .
a third suspect , attila selek , is a 24-year-old german citizen of turkish origin , while 30-year-old adem yilmaz is a turkish national .

selek was later caught in turkey .
although the men were apprehended before any attacks took place , the fact that such ' home grown ' terrorists may pose a real threat in germany is a major cause for concern , says international security expert michael lueders .
" not everyone who converts to islam is radical , but some people are , and this is really a room for concern for most security analysts in germany , " said lueders , " and nobody really knows how to solve this issue .
so these so-called converts are really targeted by police . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 10.08.2009 all signs point to eta , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor paul heywood believes that eta is not a monolithic organisation .
three bomb blasts on mallorca are the latest attacks on the popular tourist destination .
while all signs point to the involvement of eta , authorities have not officially named the group over sunday 's bombings . to learn more about the eta and their strategies , deutsche welle interviewed professor paul heywood , an expert on the basque separatist group at the university of nottingham in the united kingdom .
dw : the authorities have yet to conclusively link eta to sunday 's three bomb blasts .
is there any doubt about their involvement ? paul heywood : it is almost certain this was the work of eta , they had released statements the day before about a series of previous attacks that had taken place in june and july and these latest attacks follow a very similar pattern , including two attacks on holiday resorts in the past .
from your knowledge of the way eta operates , would they have had an active cell on the island , or would they have sent in people from the mainland ?
they probably sent people in from the mainland .
now there was , of course , the assassination of two civil guards on the island in palmanova on 30th july and these bombs that went off yesterday -lrb- sunday ed . -rrb- were all on timer devices , so it is just possible that the cell which carried out the assassinations just over a week ago also planted the bombs , though it 's a long time for bombs to be on timer devices , it 's more likely that they 've still got some people on the island .
how successful have the spanish authorities been in the past in tracking down eta bombers ?
well there have been a lot of high profile arrests of eta leaders and there 's been in recent years much more effective collaboration with the french authorities , so that the french and the spanish police have worked together to capture some of the top eta leaders .
however one of the issues - it can hardly be overstressed with any organization like eta - is that they are not single organizations where there is one leadership and if you capture that leadership then the organization is undermined .
these organizations operate on the basis of numbers of different cells which operate according to different command structures within different parts of the country , and indeed , they are often characterized by splits within the organization , so eta , just like a lot of other terrorist organizations , has historically had splits between an official leadership - quite often wanting dialogue and political interaction with the government - and more militant , often younger members , who are against dialogue and want to continue the campaign of violence .
what is likely to be the impact on spain 's tourism industry ? that 's what they are aiming for - to hurt spain 's tourism industry - this is a form of economic terrorism .
the targets are not members of the public , still less actual tourists .
eta has a history of mainly targeting members of the spanish armed forces or police and recent assassinations which have taken place have been of members of the civil guard .
eta has never really gone for soft targets in the sense of members of the public or holidaymakers , tourists .
but what they do want to do to is to instil a sense of fear so that people think twice about whether they are going to visit spain on holiday and in that sense create an economic climate for the government , which of course is already struggling with the impact of recession , which makes it much more difficult for them .

unasur was launched to promote integration among south american countries and as such has a number of initiatives at its heart which intend to consolidate trade , security and infrastructure policies across its member states .
among many of the initiatives set up at its creation , unasur aims to create a single market to eliminate the fees for non-sensitive products by 2014 and for sensitive products -lrb- i.e. , beef , dairy -rrb- by 2019 .
unasur is also pursuing an initiative for infrastructure integration of south america -lrb- iirsa -rrb- , including the construction of the inter-oceanic highway to link the pacific coast countries to allow better connections with bolivia , argentina , peru and brazil .
the presidency of unasur rotates on an annual basis , and is currently held by chilean president michelle bachelet .
the presidency will be handed to ecuador during the summit held in its capital .
the outcomes of the 2009 unasur summit are likely to have a wider significance outside of south america , with the european union and germany in particular interested in the bloc 's discussions .
as well as developments in trade relations , germany will be looking at the increased collaboration within unasur with a view to possible effects this may have on its bilateral relations .
germany 's interests feature heavily on trade out of the 12 unasur countries , germany is closest , in terms of trade and political dialogue , with brazil .
brazil is germany 's main trade partner in the unasur , with seven percent of brazilian imports coming from germany , making it brazil 's main trading partner in the eu , while five percent of brazilian exports come to germany , second only to the netherlands within the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and lula have a tight trading partnership " brazil is germany 's main partner within this country-group , " claudia zilla , a latin america expert with the americas research division at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" germany imports iron ore , auto parts , machinery , coffee , soy , animal feed , chemical products , oil , paper pulp , meat and metals from brazil .
brazil imports machinery , chemical products , auto parts , electro technology , and medicine from germany . "
zilla explained that , while trade - specifically with brazil - is an important part of germany 's involvement in south america , it is far from being its only commitment .
berlin sees opportunities to forge partnerships on a number of global issues with south american governments within unasur .
in terms of international development cooperation with south america , germany 's main partners in bilateral programs are peru , ecuador , colombia , brazil , and particularly bolivia .
partnerships pursued ; opportunities missed " besides investment and trade , germany is interested in global governance , " zilla said .
" in some policy areas like environment and energy , south american countries have high potential to become partners in global cooperation .
germany and south america share important values like multilateralism and peaceful conflict resolution .
but this does not mean both parts exploit these opportunities .
there is a lack of sustainable engagement and strategic coordination between both sides on an international level .
bildunterschrift : germany actively seeks cooperation with unasur members but opportunities are often squandered " democratic values are always an important component of germany 's partnership programs , of political dialogue and international economic cooperation , " she added .
" but it does not mean that the intensity of germany 's relationship with south american countries goes hand in hand with their democratic quality . "
" on the one hand , some cooperation with less democratic countries can be a valuable contribution to deeper democratization .
on the other hand , latin american democracies are not frozen political systems , but dynamic ones .
this makes things tough at times , as it is not easy to constantly adapt foreign relations to the changes in each country , " she said .
while common policies on tackling the effects of the global financial crisis and issues of trade and security are the main topics for the 2009 meeting , the summit is likely to be overshadowed by the row simmering between a number of unasur 's members over colombia 's plans to allow the united states use of seven military bases in its territory .
the official reason given for the us approach by alvaro uribe 's government is the fight against drug trafficking , which fuels the activities of leftist colombian rebels that have been fighting the state for more than 40 years .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , a long-time antagonist of uribe , has voiced strong opposition to colombia 's plans , and moved to freeze ties with bogota as well as recalling the venezuelan ambassador .
he considers the narcotics interdiction a pretense , and has accused the us of seeking to establish colombia as a " yankee " platform for attacks on other countries in latin america .
berlin unlikely to comment on us base plan for colombia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela and germany have a low-level relationship germany has a low-level relationship with venezuela and as such is highly unlikely to get involved in any spat over us influence in colombia .
venezuela 's trade dealings are focused on the united states while chavez 's foreign policy has a strong south-south-dimension , oriented toward his own region or toward non-eu countries like iran and russia .
" i can not imagine that germany would see anything wrong with -lrb- colombia 's plan -rrb- .
the us has had its own military base in manta for a long time , " said zilla .
" now the us is looking for alternatives after ecuador decided not to renew the lease on the base , it makes sense that -lrb- colombian president alvaro -rrb- uribe is willing to let the us use colombian bases . "
as is often the case , chavez is the most outspoken critic of us plans in latin america , but other leaders around the region have expressed reservations too after uribe toured seven south american countries to explain his plans last week .
brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva demanded formal guarantees that the planned deal between bogota and washington would not allow the use of colombian bases to launch actions on other countries in the region .
" it is essential to grant some kind of formal guarantee , a legal guarantee , that possible -lrb- us military -rrb- operations will happen strictly within colombian territory , " brazilian presidential spokesman marcelo baumbach stressed last friday .
" there is a suggestion for there to be greater transparency , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim had said earlier .
according to amorim , lula hopes all doubts can be dispelled " calmly , based on technical considerations " at the unasur summit .
lula stressed that he favors " bilateral and multilateral cooperation between south american nations to combat drug trafficking , without external interferences . "

but the indigenous communities are using both ancient knowledge and modern technology to protect biodiversity and stop further destruction . the lush green of the rain forest offers rich natural resources which the ashaninka indians have lived on for centuries .
at the yoreka atame school of primeval forestry in brazil , young indigenous and non-indigenous people have been learning how to make use of them in a sustainable way . since 2007 , the school has taught more than 2,000 participants skills like the cultivating fruit trees , keeping bees , and erecting dams in creeks and lakes to enhance spawning grounds for fish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cultivating traditional plants is part of the curriculum " that 's how we ashaninka indians here in the border region between brazil and peru want to pass on our traditional knowledge , " said moises piyako .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 10.08.2009 all signs point to eta , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor paul heywood believes that eta is not a monolithic organisation .
three bomb blasts on mallorca are the latest attacks on the popular tourist destination .
while all signs point to the involvement of eta , authorities have not officially named the group over sunday 's bombings . to learn more about the eta and their strategies , deutsche welle interviewed professor paul heywood , an expert on the basque separatist group at the university of nottingham in the united kingdom .
dw : the authorities have yet to conclusively link eta to sunday 's three bomb blasts .
is there any doubt about their involvement ? paul heywood : it is almost certain this was the work of eta , they had released statements the day before about a series of previous attacks that had taken place in june and july and these latest attacks follow a very similar pattern , including two attacks on holiday resorts in the past .
from your knowledge of the way eta operates , would they have had an active cell on the island , or would they have sent in people from the mainland ?
they probably sent people in from the mainland .
now there was , of course , the assassination of two civil guards on the island in palmanova on 30th july and these bombs that went off yesterday -lrb- sunday ed . -rrb- were all on timer devices , so it is just possible that the cell which carried out the assassinations just over a week ago also planted the bombs , though it 's a long time for bombs to be on timer devices , it 's more likely that they 've still got some people on the island .
how successful have the spanish authorities been in the past in tracking down eta bombers ?
well there have been a lot of high profile arrests of eta leaders and there 's been in recent years much more effective collaboration with the french authorities , so that the french and the spanish police have worked together to capture some of the top eta leaders .
however one of the issues - it can hardly be overstressed with any organization like eta - is that they are not single organizations where there is one leadership and if you capture that leadership then the organization is undermined .
these organizations operate on the basis of numbers of different cells which operate according to different command structures within different parts of the country , and indeed , they are often characterized by splits within the organization , so eta , just like a lot of other terrorist organizations , has historically had splits between an official leadership - quite often wanting dialogue and political interaction with the government - and more militant , often younger members , who are against dialogue and want to continue the campaign of violence .
what is likely to be the impact on spain 's tourism industry ? that 's what they are aiming for - to hurt spain 's tourism industry - this is a form of economic terrorism .
the targets are not members of the public , still less actual tourists .
eta has a history of mainly targeting members of the spanish armed forces or police and recent assassinations which have taken place have been of members of the civil guard .
eta has never really gone for soft targets in the sense of members of the public or holidaymakers , tourists .
but what they do want to do to is to instil a sense of fear so that people think twice about whether they are going to visit spain on holiday and in that sense create an economic climate for the government , which of course is already struggling with the impact of recession , which makes it much more difficult for them .

the confessions are expected to shorten the trial of the four men . in his wide-ranging confession , suspected ring leader fritz gelowicz told the court how the group 's plans for a terror attack in germany developed .
according to his confession in a duesseldorf court , the alleged mastermind of the group took part in a three-month terrorist training camp in pakistan in 2006 .
there , a plot was hatched to attack american targets , particularly military personnel , in germany .

prosecution lawyer volker brinkmann said ahead of the trial that the suspects had admitted to their goal of " killing as many americans as possible . "
unprecedented confessions the members of the so-called sauerland terror cell have been questioned by police for the past four weeks since the court adjourned for its summer recess .
their written testimonies now run to over 1,500 pages .
the confessions are more extensive than expected and they are likely to speed up the trial and reduce the sentences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presiding judge ottmar breidling called the wide-ranging confessions " impressive " chief judge ottmar breidling said the questioning during the four-week break had revealed an unexpectedly " impressive " range of information .

" in the beginning , there was talk of two years for this process , but now people talk about three or four months , " lueders told deutsche welle .
this is one of the biggest terrorism trials in germany since those involving the urban guerrillas of the red army faction in the 1970s .
suspects accused of planning massive attacks the men allegedly formed their terror cell for the islamic jihad union and stand accused of plotting at least three bomb attacks in german cities targeting us citizens .
authorities say the group aimed to carry out attacks as deadly as those of september 11 , 2001 which killed around 3,000 people in the united states .
two of the suspects , gelowicz and daniel schneider , aged 29 and 23 respectively , are german converts to islam .
a third suspect , attila selek , is a 24-year-old german citizen of turkish origin , while 30-year-old adem yilmaz is a turkish national .

selek was later caught in turkey .
although the men were apprehended before any attacks took place , the fact that such ' home grown ' terrorists may pose a real threat in germany is a major cause for concern , says international security expert michael lueders .
" not everyone who converts to islam is radical , but some people are , and this is really a room for concern for most security analysts in germany , " said lueders , " and nobody really knows how to solve this issue .

throughout the most recent dispute with iran he has continually called for restraint .
but his patience seems to have worn thin .
the immediate reason for this is the trial in tehran against a frenchwoman and two iranian employees of the french and the british embassies .
they are all accused of spying against iran and taking part in efforts to topple the islamic system .
in an interview , mr bildt said it was a show trial .
“ i 've protested very sharply on behalf of the european union .
this is not against individual persons or countries but against the european union as a whole , and this is exactly how we are treating this matter , ” said bildt .
bildt 's comments were not received well in tehran .
hassan ghashghavi , a spokesman for the iranian foreign ministry , reacted by saying it was beyond any legal logic to claim a trial in one country would simultaneously challenge 27 other countries .
ghashgavi added that iran had never interfered in elections or trials in the eu and expected the eu to do the same .
he rejected eu calls to let the defendants go free .
“ the islamic republic of iran will stand firm against irrational demands , “ said gashghavi .
eu nations also criticize trials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clotilde reiss in the dock a spokeswoman for the british foreign office called the decision to put the british embasssy 's chief political analyst , hossein rassam on trial , fully unacceptable .
in a statement released by the french foreign ministry , the french called the accusations against reiss " without foundation . "
paris has categorically denied espionage charges levied against reiss , a lecturer at a university in iran .
clotilde reiss , a french lecturer , has confessed that she supplied information on post-election protests to foreign embassies .
the iranian employee of the british embassy has said he was sent to attend and monitor the demonstrations .
eu diplomats have suggested that the accused have made these statements under pressure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 10.08.2009 all signs point to eta , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor paul heywood believes that eta is not a monolithic organisation .
three bomb blasts on mallorca are the latest attacks on the popular tourist destination .
while all signs point to the involvement of eta , authorities have not officially named the group over sunday 's bombings . to learn more about the eta and their strategies , deutsche welle interviewed professor paul heywood , an expert on the basque separatist group at the university of nottingham in the united kingdom .
dw : the authorities have yet to conclusively link eta to sunday 's three bomb blasts .
is there any doubt about their involvement ? paul heywood : it is almost certain this was the work of eta , they had released statements the day before about a series of previous attacks that had taken place in june and july and these latest attacks follow a very similar pattern , including two attacks on holiday resorts in the past .
from your knowledge of the way eta operates , would they have had an active cell on the island , or would they have sent in people from the mainland ?
they probably sent people in from the mainland .
now there was , of course , the assassination of two civil guards on the island in palmanova on 30th july and these bombs that went off yesterday -lrb- sunday ed . -rrb- were all on timer devices , so it is just possible that the cell which carried out the assassinations just over a week ago also planted the bombs , though it 's a long time for bombs to be on timer devices , it 's more likely that they 've still got some people on the island .
how successful have the spanish authorities been in the past in tracking down eta bombers ?
well there have been a lot of high profile arrests of eta leaders and there 's been in recent years much more effective collaboration with the french authorities , so that the french and the spanish police have worked together to capture some of the top eta leaders .
however one of the issues - it can hardly be overstressed with any organization like eta - is that they are not single organizations where there is one leadership and if you capture that leadership then the organization is undermined .
these organizations operate on the basis of numbers of different cells which operate according to different command structures within different parts of the country , and indeed , they are often characterized by splits within the organization , so eta , just like a lot of other terrorist organizations , has historically had splits between an official leadership - quite often wanting dialogue and political interaction with the government - and more militant , often younger members , who are against dialogue and want to continue the campaign of violence .
what is likely to be the impact on spain 's tourism industry ? that 's what they are aiming for - to hurt spain 's tourism industry - this is a form of economic terrorism .
the targets are not members of the public , still less actual tourists .
eta has a history of mainly targeting members of the spanish armed forces or police and recent assassinations which have taken place have been of members of the civil guard .
eta has never really gone for soft targets in the sense of members of the public or holidaymakers , tourists .
but what they do want to do to is to instil a sense of fear so that people think twice about whether they are going to visit spain on holiday and in that sense create an economic climate for the government , which of course is already struggling with the impact of recession , which makes it much more difficult for them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 10.08.2009 suspected leader of sauerland terror cell confesses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz gelowicz , the alleged mastermind behind the sauerland cell , confessed to planning terror attacks in germany the first of four alleged islamist militants known as the sauerland cell took the stand to confess his role in planning terror attacks in germany .
the confessions are expected to shorten the trial of the four men . in his wide-ranging confession , suspected ring leader fritz gelowicz told the court how the group 's plans for a terror attack in germany developed .
according to his confession in a duesseldorf court , the alleged mastermind of the group took part in a three-month terrorist training camp in pakistan in 2006 .
there , a plot was hatched to attack american targets , particularly military personnel , in germany .
part of the training dealt with weapons , such as kalashnikov machine guns , and the suspects were also reportedly trained in explosives and circuitry for bomb making .
prosecution lawyer volker brinkmann said ahead of the trial that the suspects had admitted to their goal of " killing as many americans as possible . "
unprecedented confessions the members of the so-called sauerland terror cell have been questioned by police for the past four weeks since the court adjourned for its summer recess .
their written testimonies now run to over 1,500 pages .
the confessions are more extensive than expected and they are likely to speed up the trial and reduce the sentences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presiding judge ottmar breidling called the wide-ranging confessions " impressive " chief judge ottmar breidling said the questioning during the four-week break had revealed an unexpectedly " impressive " range of information .
international security expert michael lueders says the confessions could significantly reduce the length of the trial .
" in the beginning , there was talk of two years for this process , but now people talk about three or four months , " lueders told deutsche welle .
this is one of the biggest terrorism trials in germany since those involving the urban guerrillas of the red army faction in the 1970s .
suspects accused of planning massive attacks the men allegedly formed their terror cell for the islamic jihad union and stand accused of plotting at least three bomb attacks in german cities targeting us citizens .
authorities say the group aimed to carry out attacks as deadly as those of september 11 , 2001 which killed around 3,000 people in the united states .
two of the suspects , gelowicz and daniel schneider , aged 29 and 23 respectively , are german converts to islam .
a third suspect , attila selek , is a 24-year-old german citizen of turkish origin , while 30-year-old adem yilmaz is a turkish national .
the threat of ' home grown ' terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the suspects were arrested in september 2007 with hydrogen peroxide drums the sauerland cell is named after a western german region where three of the men were apprehended in september 2007 along with 26 detonators and 12 drums of hydrogen peroxide , a substance used in the deadly attacks on london 's transport system two years earlier .
selek was later caught in turkey .
although the men were apprehended before any attacks took place , the fact that such ' home grown ' terrorists may pose a real threat in germany is a major cause for concern , says international security expert michael lueders .
" not everyone who converts to islam is radical , but some people are , and this is really a room for concern for most security analysts in germany , " said lueders , " and nobody really knows how to solve this issue .

the confessions are expected to shorten the trial of the four men . in his wide-ranging confession , suspected ring leader fritz gelowicz told the court how the group 's plans for a terror attack in germany developed .
according to his confession in a duesseldorf court , the alleged mastermind of the group took part in a three-month terrorist training camp in pakistan in 2006 .
there , a plot was hatched to attack american targets , particularly military personnel , in germany .
part of the training dealt with weapons , such as kalashnikov machine guns , and the suspects were also reportedly trained in explosives and circuitry for bomb making .
prosecution lawyer volker brinkmann said ahead of the trial that the suspects had admitted to their goal of " killing as many americans as possible . "
unprecedented confessions the members of the so-called sauerland terror cell have been questioned by police for the past four weeks since the court adjourned for its summer recess .
their written testimonies now run to over 1,500 pages .
the confessions are more extensive than expected and they are likely to speed up the trial and reduce the sentences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presiding judge ottmar breidling called the wide-ranging confessions " impressive " chief judge ottmar breidling said the questioning during the four-week break had revealed an unexpectedly " impressive " range of information .
international security expert michael lueders says the confessions could significantly reduce the length of the trial .
" in the beginning , there was talk of two years for this process , but now people talk about three or four months , " lueders told deutsche welle .
this is one of the biggest terrorism trials in germany since those involving the urban guerrillas of the red army faction in the 1970s .
suspects accused of planning massive attacks the men allegedly formed their terror cell for the islamic jihad union and stand accused of plotting at least three bomb attacks in german cities targeting us citizens .
authorities say the group aimed to carry out attacks as deadly as those of september 11 , 2001 which killed around 3,000 people in the united states .
two of the suspects , gelowicz and daniel schneider , aged 29 and 23 respectively , are german converts to islam .
a third suspect , attila selek , is a 24-year-old german citizen of turkish origin , while 30-year-old adem yilmaz is a turkish national .
the threat of ' home grown ' terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the suspects were arrested in september 2007 with hydrogen peroxide drums the sauerland cell is named after a western german region where three of the men were apprehended in september 2007 along with 26 detonators and 12 drums of hydrogen peroxide , a substance used in the deadly attacks on london 's transport system two years earlier .
selek was later caught in turkey .
although the men were apprehended before any attacks took place , the fact that such ' home grown ' terrorists may pose a real threat in germany is a major cause for concern , says international security expert michael lueders .
" not everyone who converts to islam is radical , but some people are , and this is really a room for concern for most security analysts in germany , " said lueders , " and nobody really knows how to solve this issue .
so these so-called converts are really targeted by police . "

three bomb blasts on mallorca are the latest attacks on the popular tourist destination .
while all signs point to the involvement of eta , authorities have not officially named the group over sunday 's bombings . to learn more about the eta and their strategies , deutsche welle interviewed professor paul heywood , an expert on the basque separatist group at the university of nottingham in the united kingdom .
dw : the authorities have yet to conclusively link eta to sunday 's three bomb blasts .
is there any doubt about their involvement ? paul heywood : it is almost certain this was the work of eta , they had released statements the day before about a series of previous attacks that had taken place in june and july and these latest attacks follow a very similar pattern , including two attacks on holiday resorts in the past .
from your knowledge of the way eta operates , would they have had an active cell on the island , or would they have sent in people from the mainland ?
they probably sent people in from the mainland .
now there was , of course , the assassination of two civil guards on the island in palmanova on 30th july and these bombs that went off yesterday -lrb- sunday ed . -rrb- were all on timer devices , so it is just possible that the cell which carried out the assassinations just over a week ago also planted the bombs , though it 's a long time for bombs to be on timer devices , it 's more likely that they 've still got some people on the island .
how successful have the spanish authorities been in the past in tracking down eta bombers ?
well there have been a lot of high profile arrests of eta leaders and there 's been in recent years much more effective collaboration with the french authorities , so that the french and the spanish police have worked together to capture some of the top eta leaders .
however one of the issues - it can hardly be overstressed with any organization like eta - is that they are not single organizations where there is one leadership and if you capture that leadership then the organization is undermined .
these organizations operate on the basis of numbers of different cells which operate according to different command structures within different parts of the country , and indeed , they are often characterized by splits within the organization , so eta , just like a lot of other terrorist organizations , has historically had splits between an official leadership - quite often wanting dialogue and political interaction with the government - and more militant , often younger members , who are against dialogue and want to continue the campaign of violence .
what is likely to be the impact on spain 's tourism industry ? that 's what they are aiming for - to hurt spain 's tourism industry - this is a form of economic terrorism .
the targets are not members of the public , still less actual tourists .
eta has a history of mainly targeting members of the spanish armed forces or police and recent assassinations which have taken place have been of members of the civil guard .
eta has never really gone for soft targets in the sense of members of the public or holidaymakers , tourists .
but what they do want to do to is to instil a sense of fear so that people think twice about whether they are going to visit spain on holiday and in that sense create an economic climate for the government , which of course is already struggling with the impact of recession , which makes it much more difficult for them .

bayreuth breaks protocol großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opera for the masses opera does n't have to be for the elite , but in bayreuth it always has been .
that the bayreuth festival is taking its wagner operas outside the festspielhaus is n't a novel idea , but it 's a big step for the green hill . some 22,000 people on sunday watched christoph marthaler 's production of the richard wagner opera " tristan and isolde . "
only one in 10 observed standard bayreuth protocol : evening gown and black tie . many of the rest were clad in shorts and sandals and had a cocktail or bratwurst in their hand .
unlike in the theater on the green hill , eating and drinking were permitted during the live broadcast of the performance on bayreuth 's central square . katharina wagner - the newly inaugurated co-director of the festival and great-granddaughter to the composer himself - initiated the public viewing last year and has said she wants to make it a bayreuth tradition . " opera is n't elitist ; it 's entertaining , " katharina wagner told reporters . with free entry and without having to spend years on the theater 's waiting list for tickets , the outdoor version is accessible to more opera fans .
those who watched the live-stream on their computers at home paid 14.90 euros -lrb- $ 21.10 -rrb- .
inside the festspielhaus , those lucky enough to get tickets can pay up to several hundred euros for them . granted , the sound quality outdoors can hardly compare with richard wagner 's specially designed theater .
however , the acoustic experienced was improved over last year 's debut broadcast - this time with 20 speakers running on 138,000 watts , according to the dpa news agency . seven cameras in the theater transported the singers to the 90-square-meter -lrb- 969-square-foot -rrb- led screen in the square .
the cast , with robert dean smith and irene theorin in the title roles , made a live appearance for their outdoor audience after the show . sunday 's broadcast was the second of its kind at this year 's bayreuth festival . author : kate bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 27.07.2009 -rrb- wagner festival gets a revamp , but is it only skin deep ?
richard wagner 's two great-granddaughters , directors of bayreuth 's renowned opera festival , are repolishing the event .
deutsche welle 's music editor says there 's a lot of new style , but the substance remains to be seen .

but the indigenous communities are using both ancient knowledge and modern technology to protect biodiversity and stop further destruction . the lush green of the rain forest offers rich natural resources which the ashaninka indians have lived on for centuries .
at the yoreka atame school of primeval forestry in brazil , young indigenous and non-indigenous people have been learning how to make use of them in a sustainable way . since 2007 , the school has taught more than 2,000 participants skills like the cultivating fruit trees , keeping bees , and erecting dams in creeks and lakes to enhance spawning grounds for fish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cultivating traditional plants is part of the curriculum " that 's how we ashaninka indians here in the border region between brazil and peru want to pass on our traditional knowledge , " said moises piyako .
he cofounded the yoreka atame school together with his brother benki in 2007 . illegal logging threatens biodiversity political problems between brazil and its neighbor peru make life complicated for the indigenous people in the border region . " we are suffering from peruvian logging companies , and now the peruvian government also wants to dig for oil along the border , " said moises piyako . illegal timber-fellers from peru are increasingly encroaching on the rainforest on both sides of the border . the land and its resources belong to the ashaninka , according to the indigenous and tribal peoples convention 169 adopted by the international labour organisation , ilo .
it recognizes the rights of ownership of the peoples over the lands which they traditionally occupy .
but peru has been trying to circumnavigate international law by granting mining concessions for areas that are owned by indigenous peoples . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ashaninka live in the border region between brazil and peru " in the process , peruvian timber companies even illegally enter brazilian territory , " said ashaninka spokesman benki piyako .
" illegal logging is putting our whole region and its biodiversity at risk . " the invasion of ashaninka rainforests by illegal loggers started in 2001 with a company called forestal venao , which is owned by the daughter of the former peruvian president , alberto fujimori .
he was recently put on trial for corruption and has already been convicted to 25 years in prison for severe human rights violations and killing opposition politicians . his daughter , keiko fujimori , has announced her candidacy for the presidency as well as her aim to officially pardon her father should she come to power .
her political campaign is partially funded by the earnings from her timber company . demand for a ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal logging damages the rainforest to prevent forestal venao from wreaking further havoc on brazilian territory , benki and moises piyako demand a world-wide ban on imports of wood illegally felled in rainforests . " there are only a few specimen left of many of the tree species , and we are trying to recultivate these economic plants , " they said , adding that there is a lack of understanding for the importance of managing resources sustainably . " we must make sure that our natural resources are not destroyed in the struggle for survival . " in their fight for environmental protection , the ashaninka combine traditional knowledge and modern technology .
some remote communities have already set up satellite-supported communication systems in the rainforest .
by checking satellite photographs on a computer , the communities can monitor illegal logging activities or the illegal construction of roads in their region . " we install this monitoring system , and we teach the local people how to operate the gps technology , " said benki piyako . hi-tech to protect the rainforest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 certificates pay for recultivation efforts in addition , benki piyako and his village of apiwtxa have set up a video blog on life in the rainforest .
there , they also post satellite photos that document how illegal logging is devastating huge areas .
it is their aim to teach people how the forest and its resources can be used without destroying them .
and they also want to set up a global network supporting the protection of their region . modern tools are also employed when it comes to environmental protection . the indigenous organization in apiwtxa sells co2 certificates , and the ashaninka also offer them to companies that want to support the protection of the rainforest .

the confessions are expected to shorten the trial of the four men . in his wide-ranging confession , suspected ring leader fritz gelowicz told the court how the group 's plans for a terror attack in germany developed .
according to his confession in a duesseldorf court , the alleged mastermind of the group took part in a three-month terrorist training camp in pakistan in 2006 .
there , a plot was hatched to attack american targets , particularly military personnel , in germany .
part of the training dealt with weapons , such as kalashnikov machine guns , and the suspects were also reportedly trained in explosives and circuitry for bomb making .
prosecution lawyer volker brinkmann said ahead of the trial that the suspects had admitted to their goal of " killing as many americans as possible . "
unprecedented confessions the members of the so-called sauerland terror cell have been questioned by police for the past four weeks since the court adjourned for its summer recess .
their written testimonies now run to over 1,500 pages .
the confessions are more extensive than expected and they are likely to speed up the trial and reduce the sentences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presiding judge ottmar breidling called the wide-ranging confessions " impressive " chief judge ottmar breidling said the questioning during the four-week break had revealed an unexpectedly " impressive " range of information .
international security expert michael lueders says the confessions could significantly reduce the length of the trial .
" in the beginning , there was talk of two years for this process , but now people talk about three or four months , " lueders told deutsche welle .
this is one of the biggest terrorism trials in germany since those involving the urban guerrillas of the red army faction in the 1970s .
suspects accused of planning massive attacks the men allegedly formed their terror cell for the islamic jihad union and stand accused of plotting at least three bomb attacks in german cities targeting us citizens .
authorities say the group aimed to carry out attacks as deadly as those of september 11 , 2001 which killed around 3,000 people in the united states .
two of the suspects , gelowicz and daniel schneider , aged 29 and 23 respectively , are german converts to islam .
a third suspect , attila selek , is a 24-year-old german citizen of turkish origin , while 30-year-old adem yilmaz is a turkish national .
the threat of ' home grown ' terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the suspects were arrested in september 2007 with hydrogen peroxide drums the sauerland cell is named after a western german region where three of the men were apprehended in september 2007 along with 26 detonators and 12 drums of hydrogen peroxide , a substance used in the deadly attacks on london 's transport system two years earlier .
selek was later caught in turkey .
although the men were apprehended before any attacks took place , the fact that such ' home grown ' terrorists may pose a real threat in germany is a major cause for concern , says international security expert michael lueders .
" not everyone who converts to islam is radical , but some people are , and this is really a room for concern for most security analysts in germany , " said lueders , " and nobody really knows how to solve this issue .
so these so-called converts are really targeted by police . "
if convicted , the suspected terrorists could face up to 15 years in prison. mz / dpa / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

throughout the most recent dispute with iran he has continually called for restraint .
but his patience seems to have worn thin .
the immediate reason for this is the trial in tehran against a frenchwoman and two iranian employees of the french and the british embassies .
they are all accused of spying against iran and taking part in efforts to topple the islamic system .
in an interview , mr bildt said it was a show trial .
“ i 've protested very sharply on behalf of the european union .
this is not against individual persons or countries but against the european union as a whole , and this is exactly how we are treating this matter , ” said bildt .
bildt 's comments were not received well in tehran .
hassan ghashghavi , a spokesman for the iranian foreign ministry , reacted by saying it was beyond any legal logic to claim a trial in one country would simultaneously challenge 27 other countries .
ghashgavi added that iran had never interfered in elections or trials in the eu and expected the eu to do the same .
he rejected eu calls to let the defendants go free .
“ the islamic republic of iran will stand firm against irrational demands , “ said gashghavi .
eu nations also criticize trials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clotilde reiss in the dock a spokeswoman for the british foreign office called the decision to put the british embasssy 's chief political analyst , hossein rassam on trial , fully unacceptable .

paris has categorically denied espionage charges levied against reiss , a lecturer at a university in iran .
clotilde reiss , a french lecturer , has confessed that she supplied information on post-election protests to foreign embassies .
the iranian employee of the british embassy has said he was sent to attend and monitor the demonstrations .
eu diplomats have suggested that the accused have made these statements under pressure .

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

however environmentalists warn that previous climate commitments are way off the mark . delegations from 192 countries are meeting in bonn to continue negotiations towards a global climate deal , which is to be finalised at a much-anticipated un meeting in copenhagen in december .
at the recent g-8 summit in the earthquake-devastated italian town of l 'aquila , developed nations , including the us , promised to limit global warming to two degrees celsius by 2050 .
however , climate experts and environmental groups say even two degrees is far too high and would have cataclysmic consequences .
martin kaiser , who is representing the environmental group greenpeace at the un climate talks , says an increase of two degrees would probably result in the disappearance of the amazon rainforest .
" -lrb- two degrees -rrb- would mean that sea levels would rise by one meter , and it would also mean that much arable land would become so dry that it would no longer be cultivable , " he says .
a replacement for kyoto in total , five rounds of preliminary talks will have been held by the time the copenhagen meeting roles around in december .
this third round of talks is intended as an ' informal meeting ' and is being held in bonn , as were the first two rounds . two further conferences are to be held in bangkok in september and october , and then in barcelona at the beginning of november .
the result of the last conference in bonn was a 300-page document with suggestions from the 192 negotiating countries .
the aim of this week 's meeting is to reduce the document to between 50 and 100 pages ; this will then form the basis of discussions in copenhagen .
suggestions abound ; commitments are scarce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests accompanied the last un climate talks in bonn despite the hundreds of pages of suggestions , solid commitments from un member nations have not been forthcoming .
disputes continue about who should do what and in what time frame .
there are also questions about who should provide financing for developing nations so that they can also combat the effects of climate change .
yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change , recently told the french news agency afp that the kyoto-replacement climate treaty would be crippled without strong commitments from developed nations and would " defeat the whole purpose of the copenhagen agreement . "
developed nations have been reluctant to agree to concrete commitments without the support of developing nations , especially china and india , two of the world 's fastest growing countries with the world 's two largest populations .

however environmentalists warn that previous climate commitments are way off the mark . delegations from 192 countries are meeting in bonn to continue negotiations towards a global climate deal , which is to be finalised at a much-anticipated un meeting in copenhagen in december .
at the recent g-8 summit in the earthquake-devastated italian town of l 'aquila , developed nations , including the us , promised to limit global warming to two degrees celsius by 2050 .
however , climate experts and environmental groups say even two degrees is far too high and would have cataclysmic consequences .
martin kaiser , who is representing the environmental group greenpeace at the un climate talks , says an increase of two degrees would probably result in the disappearance of the amazon rainforest .
" -lrb- two degrees -rrb- would mean that sea levels would rise by one meter , and it would also mean that much arable land would become so dry that it would no longer be cultivable , " he says .
a replacement for kyoto in total , five rounds of preliminary talks will have been held by the time the copenhagen meeting roles around in december .
this third round of talks is intended as an ' informal meeting ' and is being held in bonn , as were the first two rounds . two further conferences are to be held in bangkok in september and october , and then in barcelona at the beginning of november .
the result of the last conference in bonn was a 300-page document with suggestions from the 192 negotiating countries .
the aim of this week 's meeting is to reduce the document to between 50 and 100 pages ; this will then form the basis of discussions in copenhagen .
suggestions abound ; commitments are scarce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests accompanied the last un climate talks in bonn despite the hundreds of pages of suggestions , solid commitments from un member nations have not been forthcoming .
disputes continue about who should do what and in what time frame .
there are also questions about who should provide financing for developing nations so that they can also combat the effects of climate change .
yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change , recently told the french news agency afp that the kyoto-replacement climate treaty would be crippled without strong commitments from developed nations and would " defeat the whole purpose of the copenhagen agreement . "
developed nations have been reluctant to agree to concrete commitments without the support of developing nations , especially china and india , two of the world 's fastest growing countries with the world 's two largest populations .
however , china and india say that their commitments should not be equal to those of wealthy countries because their populations are poorer and because they say their nations ' growth would be stilted by restrictions .

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

that the bayreuth festival is taking its wagner operas outside the festspielhaus is n't a novel idea , but it 's a big step for the green hill . some 22,000 people on sunday watched christoph marthaler 's production of the richard wagner opera " tristan and isolde . "

unlike in the theater on the green hill , eating and drinking were permitted during the live broadcast of the performance on bayreuth 's central square . katharina wagner - the newly inaugurated co-director of the festival and great-granddaughter to the composer himself - initiated the public viewing last year and has said she wants to make it a bayreuth tradition . " opera is n't elitist ; it 's entertaining , " katharina wagner told reporters . with free entry and without having to spend years on the theater 's waiting list for tickets , the outdoor version is accessible to more opera fans .
those who watched the live-stream on their computers at home paid 14.90 euros -lrb- $ 21.10 -rrb- .
inside the festspielhaus , those lucky enough to get tickets can pay up to several hundred euros for them . granted , the sound quality outdoors can hardly compare with richard wagner 's specially designed theater .

praised for his musical versatility , he told dw how all musical genres are linked - and what he 's going to do when he retires . martin grubinger has performed in some of the world 's top concert halls , including the koelner philharmonie , the concertgebouw in amsterdam and carnegie hall in new york .
he is currently active in the european summer music festival scene , playing at the salzburg festival in austria and at germany 's schleswig-holstein music festival , where he is an artist in residence . deutsche welle : you 're at home in practically every musical genre .
how did you become such a versatile musician ? martin grubinger : for us percussionists , there 's a logical connection between contemporary music and jazz .
or take salsa , samba , tango , funk , fusion , rock - all of these belong together for us percussionists .
every genre has a connection to all the others and percussion is at home in all these areas . was exactly is the connection between jazz and contemporary music ? contemporary music has a lot to do with percussion because the composers today use a lot of different percussion instruments in their works .
they 're discovering the instrument , both in solo and orchestral contexts - there 's always quite a lot of percussion in contemporary compositions .
without percussion , the music would n't work - without the rhythm and the stringency . can you describe the different challenges that jazz and contemporary music involve ? yes , of course these different types of music have to be approached differently .
with jazz , you are creative and you can do a lot - every evening is different .
in contemporary music , it 's important to the composers that you stay true to the score and actually play what 's written .
that 's crucial because the composers have something particular in mind . if i were to improvise a work by iannis xenakis , for example , it would be a scandal , a falsification .
it would totally miss the composer 's idea .
xenakis mathematically calculates the relationship between the instruments .
that means if you do n't play exactly what 's in the score , the result would be total chaos . with jazz , it 's completely different .
there , you just have to stay within the meter and the harmonies and otherwise you 're pretty much free . bildunterschrift : without percussion , contemporary music would n't work , says grubinger this year , you 're an artist in residence at the schleswig-holstein music festival , where you 've given a wide variety of workshops and concerts and with diverse programs .
all of your concerts were sold out , which earned you the label " audience magnet . " yes , it 's actually really funny .
for us musicians , things happen via friendships and connections .
you hear people when you 're on tour - you sit in concerts and think , he has to play with my ensemble , i want to work with him ! in our case , we 're in a position to bring a big audience into the concert hall , so of course the good musicians want to play with us .
that 's a big advantage , because that way we can gain a lot of quality and expertise in very different areas . the other musicians who work with you have said they really enjoy it .
is there a reciprocal effect with the members of your ensemble ? it 's unbelievable what you can learn on such an evening , you 're sensitized to entirely new things .
as a percussionist , you work in one direction , then there 's a violinist who has a completely different idea of how things should sound and a much bigger palette of colors .
he has a different idea of phrasing and rhythm , and an entirely different perspective on music .
it 's important , then , to learn to say , i want to watch out for those things too . you once said you work with a sports medicine specialist to be able to perform at 100 percent capacity even when your pulse is running at an average of 160 beats per minute during a concert .
you always perform from memory - do you ever have time to relax ? i 'm passionate about cycling and can relax really well when i 'm doing that , or when i 'm playing or watching soccer .

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

praised for his musical versatility , he told dw how all musical genres are linked - and what he 's going to do when he retires . martin grubinger has performed in some of the world 's top concert halls , including the koelner philharmonie , the concertgebouw in amsterdam and carnegie hall in new york .
he is currently active in the european summer music festival scene , playing at the salzburg festival in austria and at germany 's schleswig-holstein music festival , where he is an artist in residence . deutsche welle : you 're at home in practically every musical genre .
how did you become such a versatile musician ? martin grubinger : for us percussionists , there 's a logical connection between contemporary music and jazz .
or take salsa , samba , tango , funk , fusion , rock - all of these belong together for us percussionists .
every genre has a connection to all the others and percussion is at home in all these areas . was exactly is the connection between jazz and contemporary music ? contemporary music has a lot to do with percussion because the composers today use a lot of different percussion instruments in their works .
they 're discovering the instrument , both in solo and orchestral contexts - there 's always quite a lot of percussion in contemporary compositions .
without percussion , the music would n't work - without the rhythm and the stringency . can you describe the different challenges that jazz and contemporary music involve ? yes , of course these different types of music have to be approached differently .
with jazz , you are creative and you can do a lot - every evening is different .
in contemporary music , it 's important to the composers that you stay true to the score and actually play what 's written .
that 's crucial because the composers have something particular in mind . if i were to improvise a work by iannis xenakis , for example , it would be a scandal , a falsification .
it would totally miss the composer 's idea .
xenakis mathematically calculates the relationship between the instruments .
that means if you do n't play exactly what 's in the score , the result would be total chaos . with jazz , it 's completely different .
there , you just have to stay within the meter and the harmonies and otherwise you 're pretty much free . bildunterschrift : without percussion , contemporary music would n't work , says grubinger this year , you 're an artist in residence at the schleswig-holstein music festival , where you 've given a wide variety of workshops and concerts and with diverse programs .
all of your concerts were sold out , which earned you the label " audience magnet . " yes , it 's actually really funny .
for us musicians , things happen via friendships and connections .
you hear people when you 're on tour - you sit in concerts and think , he has to play with my ensemble , i want to work with him ! in our case , we 're in a position to bring a big audience into the concert hall , so of course the good musicians want to play with us .
that 's a big advantage , because that way we can gain a lot of quality and expertise in very different areas . the other musicians who work with you have said they really enjoy it .
is there a reciprocal effect with the members of your ensemble ? it 's unbelievable what you can learn on such an evening , you 're sensitized to entirely new things .
as a percussionist , you work in one direction , then there 's a violinist who has a completely different idea of how things should sound and a much bigger palette of colors .
he has a different idea of phrasing and rhythm , and an entirely different perspective on music .
it 's important , then , to learn to say , i want to watch out for those things too . you once said you work with a sports medicine specialist to be able to perform at 100 percent capacity even when your pulse is running at an average of 160 beats per minute during a concert .
you always perform from memory - do you ever have time to relax ? i 'm passionate about cycling and can relax really well when i 'm doing that , or when i 'm playing or watching soccer .
i like to read about socio-political things and i love history .
when i stop playing percussion , i want to study history . interview : magdalene melchers -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 10.08.2009 mallorca tourists unperturbed by eta bombs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish police are unsure if the attackers are still on the island german tourists have so far not cancelled their holiday trips to the spanish resort island of mallorca , despite a recent spate of bomb attacks believed to have been organized by basque separatist group eta . thousands of mainly german and british holidaymakers flock to the resort island of mallorca each year , and these bomb attacks have come at the height of the tourist season .
it 's another blow to the local tourist industry , with many travelers already concerned about the large number of swine flu cases on the island .
a spokesperson from the german foreign ministry told deutsche welle that the ministry has updated its travel information to make tourists aware of the bombings , with tips such as trying to avoid large crowds .
however , the ministry has not issued a travel warning for mallorca and early indications are that the bombs have not caused tourists to cut short their summer breaks .
sybille zeuch from the german travel association says there is currently no suggestion that the bomb attacks will drive away the 170,000 german tourists now on mallorca .
" what is different from other terrorist attacks is that eta does not want to target tourists and no one has been hurt in these attacks , " zeuch told deutsche welle .
" eta wants to spread fear but they do n't want any victims ; what they want to target is the economy . "
the spanish government has remained defiant , saying the impact on tourism from the blasts will be minimal .
" eta has been trying to inflict damage on the spanish tourism industry for 30 years , " joan mesquida , spain 's state secretary for tourism , said in palma de mallorca on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cordoned off the can tere antoni beach in mallorca after they received bomb warnings allegedly from eta eta responsible ?
all three bombs were planted in ladies ' toilets , indicating that at least one of the attackers was a woman , however police have not yet been unable to formally identify those responsible .
indications are that basque separatist group eta was behind the blasts , after police received warnings earlier in the day that attacks would occur , from someone claiming to be from eta .
the group also admitted responsibility on sunday for a number of recent attacks , including a car bomb on mallorca just over a week ago that killed two civil guards .
thanks to the warnings , no one was hurt in the explosions .
the explosives were also not particularly powerful , leading authorities to believe that the attacks were intended only as a warning and not to cause injury .
authorities are investigating whether the bombs were set off with the use of timers , which would have allowed the devices to be planted several days in advance and given those responsible time to escape .

all three bombs were planted in ladies ' toilets , indicating that at least one of the attackers was a woman , however police have not yet been unable to formally identify those responsible .
indications are that basque separatist group eta was behind the blasts , after police received warnings earlier in the day that attacks would occur , from someone claiming to be from eta .
the group also admitted responsibility on sunday for a number of recent attacks , including a car bomb on mallorca just over a week ago that killed two civil guards .
thanks to the warnings , no one was hurt in the explosions .
the explosives were also not particularly powerful , leading authorities to believe that the attacks were intended only as a warning and not to cause injury .
authorities are investigating whether the bombs were set off with the use of timers , which would have allowed the devices to be planted several days in advance and given those responsible time to escape .

among many of the initiatives set up at its creation , unasur aims to create a single market to eliminate the fees for non-sensitive products by 2014 and for sensitive products -lrb- i.e. , beef , dairy -rrb- by 2019 .
unasur is also pursuing an initiative for infrastructure integration of south america -lrb- iirsa -rrb- , including the construction of the inter-oceanic highway to link the pacific coast countries to allow better connections with bolivia , argentina , peru and brazil .
the presidency of unasur rotates on an annual basis , and is currently held by chilean president michelle bachelet .
the presidency will be handed to ecuador during the summit held in its capital .
the outcomes of the 2009 unasur summit are likely to have a wider significance outside of south america , with the european union and germany in particular interested in the bloc 's discussions .
as well as developments in trade relations , germany will be looking at the increased collaboration within unasur with a view to possible effects this may have on its bilateral relations .
germany 's interests feature heavily on trade out of the 12 unasur countries , germany is closest , in terms of trade and political dialogue , with brazil .
brazil is germany 's main trade partner in the unasur , with seven percent of brazilian imports coming from germany , making it brazil 's main trading partner in the eu , while five percent of brazilian exports come to germany , second only to the netherlands within the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and lula have a tight trading partnership " brazil is germany 's main partner within this country-group , " claudia zilla , a latin america expert with the americas research division at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" germany imports iron ore , auto parts , machinery , coffee , soy , animal feed , chemical products , oil , paper pulp , meat and metals from brazil .
brazil imports machinery , chemical products , auto parts , electro technology , and medicine from germany . "
zilla explained that , while trade - specifically with brazil - is an important part of germany 's involvement in south america , it is far from being its only commitment .
berlin sees opportunities to forge partnerships on a number of global issues with south american governments within unasur .
in terms of international development cooperation with south america , germany 's main partners in bilateral programs are peru , ecuador , colombia , brazil , and particularly bolivia .
partnerships pursued ; opportunities missed " besides investment and trade , germany is interested in global governance , " zilla said .
" in some policy areas like environment and energy , south american countries have high potential to become partners in global cooperation .
germany and south america share important values like multilateralism and peaceful conflict resolution .
but this does not mean both parts exploit these opportunities .
there is a lack of sustainable engagement and strategic coordination between both sides on an international level .
bildunterschrift : germany actively seeks cooperation with unasur members but opportunities are often squandered " democratic values are always an important component of germany 's partnership programs , of political dialogue and international economic cooperation , " she added .
" but it does not mean that the intensity of germany 's relationship with south american countries goes hand in hand with their democratic quality . "
" on the one hand , some cooperation with less democratic countries can be a valuable contribution to deeper democratization .
on the other hand , latin american democracies are not frozen political systems , but dynamic ones .
this makes things tough at times , as it is not easy to constantly adapt foreign relations to the changes in each country , " she said .
while common policies on tackling the effects of the global financial crisis and issues of trade and security are the main topics for the 2009 meeting , the summit is likely to be overshadowed by the row simmering between a number of unasur 's members over colombia 's plans to allow the united states use of seven military bases in its territory .
the official reason given for the us approach by alvaro uribe 's government is the fight against drug trafficking , which fuels the activities of leftist colombian rebels that have been fighting the state for more than 40 years .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , a long-time antagonist of uribe , has voiced strong opposition to colombia 's plans , and moved to freeze ties with bogota as well as recalling the venezuelan ambassador .
he considers the narcotics interdiction a pretense , and has accused the us of seeking to establish colombia as a " yankee " platform for attacks on other countries in latin america .
berlin unlikely to comment on us base plan for colombia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela and germany have a low-level relationship germany has a low-level relationship with venezuela and as such is highly unlikely to get involved in any spat over us influence in colombia .
venezuela 's trade dealings are focused on the united states while chavez 's foreign policy has a strong south-south-dimension , oriented toward his own region or toward non-eu countries like iran and russia .
" i can not imagine that germany would see anything wrong with -lrb- colombia 's plan -rrb- .
the us has had its own military base in manta for a long time , " said zilla .
" now the us is looking for alternatives after ecuador decided not to renew the lease on the base , it makes sense that -lrb- colombian president alvaro -rrb- uribe is willing to let the us use colombian bases . "
as is often the case , chavez is the most outspoken critic of us plans in latin america , but other leaders around the region have expressed reservations too after uribe toured seven south american countries to explain his plans last week .
brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva demanded formal guarantees that the planned deal between bogota and washington would not allow the use of colombian bases to launch actions on other countries in the region .
" it is essential to grant some kind of formal guarantee , a legal guarantee , that possible -lrb- us military -rrb- operations will happen strictly within colombian territory , " brazilian presidential spokesman marcelo baumbach stressed last friday .
" there is a suggestion for there to be greater transparency , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim had said earlier .
according to amorim , lula hopes all doubts can be dispelled " calmly , based on technical considerations " at the unasur summit .
lula stressed that he favors " bilateral and multilateral cooperation between south american nations to combat drug trafficking , without external interferences . "

but this does not mean both parts exploit these opportunities .
there is a lack of sustainable engagement and strategic coordination between both sides on an international level .
bildunterschrift : germany actively seeks cooperation with unasur members but opportunities are often squandered " democratic values are always an important component of germany 's partnership programs , of political dialogue and international economic cooperation , " she added .
" but it does not mean that the intensity of germany 's relationship with south american countries goes hand in hand with their democratic quality . "
" on the one hand , some cooperation with less democratic countries can be a valuable contribution to deeper democratization .
on the other hand , latin american democracies are not frozen political systems , but dynamic ones .
this makes things tough at times , as it is not easy to constantly adapt foreign relations to the changes in each country , " she said .
while common policies on tackling the effects of the global financial crisis and issues of trade and security are the main topics for the 2009 meeting , the summit is likely to be overshadowed by the row simmering between a number of unasur 's members over colombia 's plans to allow the united states use of seven military bases in its territory .
the official reason given for the us approach by alvaro uribe 's government is the fight against drug trafficking , which fuels the activities of leftist colombian rebels that have been fighting the state for more than 40 years .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , a long-time antagonist of uribe , has voiced strong opposition to colombia 's plans , and moved to freeze ties with bogota as well as recalling the venezuelan ambassador .
he considers the narcotics interdiction a pretense , and has accused the us of seeking to establish colombia as a " yankee " platform for attacks on other countries in latin america .
berlin unlikely to comment on us base plan for colombia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela and germany have a low-level relationship germany has a low-level relationship with venezuela and as such is highly unlikely to get involved in any spat over us influence in colombia .
venezuela 's trade dealings are focused on the united states while chavez 's foreign policy has a strong south-south-dimension , oriented toward his own region or toward non-eu countries like iran and russia .
" i can not imagine that germany would see anything wrong with -lrb- colombia 's plan -rrb- .
the us has had its own military base in manta for a long time , " said zilla .
" now the us is looking for alternatives after ecuador decided not to renew the lease on the base , it makes sense that -lrb- colombian president alvaro -rrb- uribe is willing to let the us use colombian bases . "
as is often the case , chavez is the most outspoken critic of us plans in latin america , but other leaders around the region have expressed reservations too after uribe toured seven south american countries to explain his plans last week .
brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva demanded formal guarantees that the planned deal between bogota and washington would not allow the use of colombian bases to launch actions on other countries in the region .
" it is essential to grant some kind of formal guarantee , a legal guarantee , that possible -lrb- us military -rrb- operations will happen strictly within colombian territory , " brazilian presidential spokesman marcelo baumbach stressed last friday .
" there is a suggestion for there to be greater transparency , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim had said earlier .
according to amorim , lula hopes all doubts can be dispelled " calmly , based on technical considerations " at the unasur summit .
lula stressed that he favors " bilateral and multilateral cooperation between south american nations to combat drug trafficking , without external interferences . "

bayreuth breaks protocol großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opera for the masses opera does n't have to be for the elite , but in bayreuth it always has been .
that the bayreuth festival is taking its wagner operas outside the festspielhaus is n't a novel idea , but it 's a big step for the green hill . some 22,000 people on sunday watched christoph marthaler 's production of the richard wagner opera " tristan and isolde . "
only one in 10 observed standard bayreuth protocol : evening gown and black tie . many of the rest were clad in shorts and sandals and had a cocktail or bratwurst in their hand .
unlike in the theater on the green hill , eating and drinking were permitted during the live broadcast of the performance on bayreuth 's central square . katharina wagner - the newly inaugurated co-director of the festival and great-granddaughter to the composer himself - initiated the public viewing last year and has said she wants to make it a bayreuth tradition . " opera is n't elitist ; it 's entertaining , " katharina wagner told reporters . with free entry and without having to spend years on the theater 's waiting list for tickets , the outdoor version is accessible to more opera fans .
those who watched the live-stream on their computers at home paid 14.90 euros -lrb- $ 21.10 -rrb- .
inside the festspielhaus , those lucky enough to get tickets can pay up to several hundred euros for them . granted , the sound quality outdoors can hardly compare with richard wagner 's specially designed theater .
however , the acoustic experienced was improved over last year 's debut broadcast - this time with 20 speakers running on 138,000 watts , according to the dpa news agency . seven cameras in the theater transported the singers to the 90-square-meter -lrb- 969-square-foot -rrb- led screen in the square .
the cast , with robert dean smith and irene theorin in the title roles , made a live appearance for their outdoor audience after the show . sunday 's broadcast was the second of its kind at this year 's bayreuth festival . author : kate bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

throughout the most recent dispute with iran he has continually called for restraint .
but his patience seems to have worn thin .
the immediate reason for this is the trial in tehran against a frenchwoman and two iranian employees of the french and the british embassies .
they are all accused of spying against iran and taking part in efforts to topple the islamic system .
in an interview , mr bildt said it was a show trial .
“ i 've protested very sharply on behalf of the european union .
this is not against individual persons or countries but against the european union as a whole , and this is exactly how we are treating this matter , ” said bildt .
bildt 's comments were not received well in tehran .
hassan ghashghavi , a spokesman for the iranian foreign ministry , reacted by saying it was beyond any legal logic to claim a trial in one country would simultaneously challenge 27 other countries .
ghashgavi added that iran had never interfered in elections or trials in the eu and expected the eu to do the same .
he rejected eu calls to let the defendants go free .

bayreuth breaks protocol großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opera for the masses opera does n't have to be for the elite , but in bayreuth it always has been .
that the bayreuth festival is taking its wagner operas outside the festspielhaus is n't a novel idea , but it 's a big step for the green hill . some 22,000 people on sunday watched christoph marthaler 's production of the richard wagner opera " tristan and isolde . "
only one in 10 observed standard bayreuth protocol : evening gown and black tie . many of the rest were clad in shorts and sandals and had a cocktail or bratwurst in their hand .
unlike in the theater on the green hill , eating and drinking were permitted during the live broadcast of the performance on bayreuth 's central square . katharina wagner - the newly inaugurated co-director of the festival and great-granddaughter to the composer himself - initiated the public viewing last year and has said she wants to make it a bayreuth tradition . " opera is n't elitist ; it 's entertaining , " katharina wagner told reporters . with free entry and without having to spend years on the theater 's waiting list for tickets , the outdoor version is accessible to more opera fans .
those who watched the live-stream on their computers at home paid 14.90 euros -lrb- $ 21.10 -rrb- .
inside the festspielhaus , those lucky enough to get tickets can pay up to several hundred euros for them . granted , the sound quality outdoors can hardly compare with richard wagner 's specially designed theater .
however , the acoustic experienced was improved over last year 's debut broadcast - this time with 20 speakers running on 138,000 watts , according to the dpa news agency . seven cameras in the theater transported the singers to the 90-square-meter -lrb- 969-square-foot -rrb- led screen in the square .
the cast , with robert dean smith and irene theorin in the title roles , made a live appearance for their outdoor audience after the show . sunday 's broadcast was the second of its kind at this year 's bayreuth festival . author : kate bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 30.07.2009 -rrb- the charm offensive : bayreuth at the dawn of a new era the 98th bayreuth festival has started its process of renewal by turning on the charm and changing its tone after a long war of attrition with the german press .

richard wagner 's two great-granddaughters , directors of bayreuth 's renowned opera festival , are repolishing the event .

the confessions are expected to shorten the trial of the four men . in his wide-ranging confession , suspected ring leader fritz gelowicz told the court how the group 's plans for a terror attack in germany developed .
according to his confession in a duesseldorf court , the alleged mastermind of the group took part in a three-month terrorist training camp in pakistan in 2006 .
there , a plot was hatched to attack american targets , particularly military personnel , in germany .
part of the training dealt with weapons , such as kalashnikov machine guns , and the suspects were also reportedly trained in explosives and circuitry for bomb making .
prosecution lawyer volker brinkmann said ahead of the trial that the suspects had admitted to their goal of " killing as many americans as possible . "
unprecedented confessions the members of the so-called sauerland terror cell have been questioned by police for the past four weeks since the court adjourned for its summer recess .
their written testimonies now run to over 1,500 pages .
the confessions are more extensive than expected and they are likely to speed up the trial and reduce the sentences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presiding judge ottmar breidling called the wide-ranging confessions " impressive " chief judge ottmar breidling said the questioning during the four-week break had revealed an unexpectedly " impressive " range of information .
international security expert michael lueders says the confessions could significantly reduce the length of the trial .
" in the beginning , there was talk of two years for this process , but now people talk about three or four months , " lueders told deutsche welle .
this is one of the biggest terrorism trials in germany since those involving the urban guerrillas of the red army faction in the 1970s .
suspects accused of planning massive attacks the men allegedly formed their terror cell for the islamic jihad union and stand accused of plotting at least three bomb attacks in german cities targeting us citizens .
authorities say the group aimed to carry out attacks as deadly as those of september 11 , 2001 which killed around 3,000 people in the united states .
two of the suspects , gelowicz and daniel schneider , aged 29 and 23 respectively , are german converts to islam .
a third suspect , attila selek , is a 24-year-old german citizen of turkish origin , while 30-year-old adem yilmaz is a turkish national .
the threat of ' home grown ' terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the suspects were arrested in september 2007 with hydrogen peroxide drums the sauerland cell is named after a western german region where three of the men were apprehended in september 2007 along with 26 detonators and 12 drums of hydrogen peroxide , a substance used in the deadly attacks on london 's transport system two years earlier .
selek was later caught in turkey .
although the men were apprehended before any attacks took place , the fact that such ' home grown ' terrorists may pose a real threat in germany is a major cause for concern , says international security expert michael lueders .
" not everyone who converts to islam is radical , but some people are , and this is really a room for concern for most security analysts in germany , " said lueders , " and nobody really knows how to solve this issue .
so these so-called converts are really targeted by police . "

unprecedented confessions the members of the so-called sauerland terror cell have been questioned by police for the past four weeks since the court adjourned for its summer recess .

bayreuth breaks protocol großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opera for the masses opera does n't have to be for the elite , but in bayreuth it always has been .
that the bayreuth festival is taking its wagner operas outside the festspielhaus is n't a novel idea , but it 's a big step for the green hill . some 22,000 people on sunday watched christoph marthaler 's production of the richard wagner opera " tristan and isolde . "
only one in 10 observed standard bayreuth protocol : evening gown and black tie . many of the rest were clad in shorts and sandals and had a cocktail or bratwurst in their hand .
unlike in the theater on the green hill , eating and drinking were permitted during the live broadcast of the performance on bayreuth 's central square . katharina wagner - the newly inaugurated co-director of the festival and great-granddaughter to the composer himself - initiated the public viewing last year and has said she wants to make it a bayreuth tradition . " opera is n't elitist ; it 's entertaining , " katharina wagner told reporters . with free entry and without having to spend years on the theater 's waiting list for tickets , the outdoor version is accessible to more opera fans .
those who watched the live-stream on their computers at home paid 14.90 euros -lrb- $ 21.10 -rrb- .
inside the festspielhaus , those lucky enough to get tickets can pay up to several hundred euros for them . granted , the sound quality outdoors can hardly compare with richard wagner 's specially designed theater .
however , the acoustic experienced was improved over last year 's debut broadcast - this time with 20 speakers running on 138,000 watts , according to the dpa news agency . seven cameras in the theater transported the singers to the 90-square-meter -lrb- 969-square-foot -rrb- led screen in the square .
the cast , with robert dean smith and irene theorin in the title roles , made a live appearance for their outdoor audience after the show . sunday 's broadcast was the second of its kind at this year 's bayreuth festival . author : kate bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its first webcast of mozart 's " cosi fan tutte " debuts at just a fraction of the live ticket price .
-lrb- 30.07.2009 -rrb- the charm offensive : bayreuth at the dawn of a new era the 98th bayreuth festival has started its process of renewal by turning on the charm and changing its tone after a long war of attrition with the german press .
-lrb- 27.07.2009 -rrb- wagner festival gets a revamp , but is it only skin deep ?
richard wagner 's two great-granddaughters , directors of bayreuth 's renowned opera festival , are repolishing the event .
deutsche welle 's music editor says there 's a lot of new style , but the substance remains to be seen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 10.08.2009 all signs point to eta , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor paul heywood believes that eta is not a monolithic organisation .
three bomb blasts on mallorca are the latest attacks on the popular tourist destination .
while all signs point to the involvement of eta , authorities have not officially named the group over sunday 's bombings . to learn more about the eta and their strategies , deutsche welle interviewed professor paul heywood , an expert on the basque separatist group at the university of nottingham in the united kingdom .
dw : the authorities have yet to conclusively link eta to sunday 's three bomb blasts .
is there any doubt about their involvement ? paul heywood : it is almost certain this was the work of eta , they had released statements the day before about a series of previous attacks that had taken place in june and july and these latest attacks follow a very similar pattern , including two attacks on holiday resorts in the past .
from your knowledge of the way eta operates , would they have had an active cell on the island , or would they have sent in people from the mainland ?
they probably sent people in from the mainland .
now there was , of course , the assassination of two civil guards on the island in palmanova on 30th july and these bombs that went off yesterday -lrb- sunday ed . -rrb- were all on timer devices , so it is just possible that the cell which carried out the assassinations just over a week ago also planted the bombs , though it 's a long time for bombs to be on timer devices , it 's more likely that they 've still got some people on the island .
how successful have the spanish authorities been in the past in tracking down eta bombers ?
well there have been a lot of high profile arrests of eta leaders and there 's been in recent years much more effective collaboration with the french authorities , so that the french and the spanish police have worked together to capture some of the top eta leaders .
however one of the issues - it can hardly be overstressed with any organization like eta - is that they are not single organizations where there is one leadership and if you capture that leadership then the organization is undermined .
these organizations operate on the basis of numbers of different cells which operate according to different command structures within different parts of the country , and indeed , they are often characterized by splits within the organization , so eta , just like a lot of other terrorist organizations , has historically had splits between an official leadership - quite often wanting dialogue and political interaction with the government - and more militant , often younger members , who are against dialogue and want to continue the campaign of violence .
what is likely to be the impact on spain 's tourism industry ? that 's what they are aiming for - to hurt spain 's tourism industry - this is a form of economic terrorism .
the targets are not members of the public , still less actual tourists .
eta has a history of mainly targeting members of the spanish armed forces or police and recent assassinations which have taken place have been of members of the civil guard .
eta has never really gone for soft targets in the sense of members of the public or holidaymakers , tourists .
but what they do want to do to is to instil a sense of fear so that people think twice about whether they are going to visit spain on holiday and in that sense create an economic climate for the government , which of course is already struggling with the impact of recession , which makes it much more difficult for them .

three bomb blasts on mallorca are the latest attacks on the popular tourist destination .
while all signs point to the involvement of eta , authorities have not officially named the group over sunday 's bombings . to learn more about the eta and their strategies , deutsche welle interviewed professor paul heywood , an expert on the basque separatist group at the university of nottingham in the united kingdom .
dw : the authorities have yet to conclusively link eta to sunday 's three bomb blasts .
is there any doubt about their involvement ? paul heywood : it is almost certain this was the work of eta , they had released statements the day before about a series of previous attacks that had taken place in june and july and these latest attacks follow a very similar pattern , including two attacks on holiday resorts in the past .
from your knowledge of the way eta operates , would they have had an active cell on the island , or would they have sent in people from the mainland ?
they probably sent people in from the mainland .
now there was , of course , the assassination of two civil guards on the island in palmanova on 30th july and these bombs that went off yesterday -lrb- sunday ed . -rrb- were all on timer devices , so it is just possible that the cell which carried out the assassinations just over a week ago also planted the bombs , though it 's a long time for bombs to be on timer devices , it 's more likely that they 've still got some people on the island .
how successful have the spanish authorities been in the past in tracking down eta bombers ?
well there have been a lot of high profile arrests of eta leaders and there 's been in recent years much more effective collaboration with the french authorities , so that the french and the spanish police have worked together to capture some of the top eta leaders .
however one of the issues - it can hardly be overstressed with any organization like eta - is that they are not single organizations where there is one leadership and if you capture that leadership then the organization is undermined .
these organizations operate on the basis of numbers of different cells which operate according to different command structures within different parts of the country , and indeed , they are often characterized by splits within the organization , so eta , just like a lot of other terrorist organizations , has historically had splits between an official leadership - quite often wanting dialogue and political interaction with the government - and more militant , often younger members , who are against dialogue and want to continue the campaign of violence .
what is likely to be the impact on spain 's tourism industry ? that 's what they are aiming for - to hurt spain 's tourism industry - this is a form of economic terrorism .
the targets are not members of the public , still less actual tourists .
eta has a history of mainly targeting members of the spanish armed forces or police and recent assassinations which have taken place have been of members of the civil guard .
eta has never really gone for soft targets in the sense of members of the public or holidaymakers , tourists .
but what they do want to do to is to instil a sense of fear so that people think twice about whether they are going to visit spain on holiday and in that sense create an economic climate for the government , which of course is already struggling with the impact of recession , which makes it much more difficult for them .

bayreuth breaks protocol großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opera for the masses opera does n't have to be for the elite , but in bayreuth it always has been .
that the bayreuth festival is taking its wagner operas outside the festspielhaus is n't a novel idea , but it 's a big step for the green hill . some 22,000 people on sunday watched christoph marthaler 's production of the richard wagner opera " tristan and isolde . "
only one in 10 observed standard bayreuth protocol : evening gown and black tie . many of the rest were clad in shorts and sandals and had a cocktail or bratwurst in their hand .
unlike in the theater on the green hill , eating and drinking were permitted during the live broadcast of the performance on bayreuth 's central square . katharina wagner - the newly inaugurated co-director of the festival and great-granddaughter to the composer himself - initiated the public viewing last year and has said she wants to make it a bayreuth tradition . " opera is n't elitist ; it 's entertaining , " katharina wagner told reporters . with free entry and without having to spend years on the theater 's waiting list for tickets , the outdoor version is accessible to more opera fans .
those who watched the live-stream on their computers at home paid 14.90 euros -lrb- $ 21.10 -rrb- .
inside the festspielhaus , those lucky enough to get tickets can pay up to several hundred euros for them . granted , the sound quality outdoors can hardly compare with richard wagner 's specially designed theater .
however , the acoustic experienced was improved over last year 's debut broadcast - this time with 20 speakers running on 138,000 watts , according to the dpa news agency . seven cameras in the theater transported the singers to the 90-square-meter -lrb- 969-square-foot -rrb- led screen in the square .
the cast , with robert dean smith and irene theorin in the title roles , made a live appearance for their outdoor audience after the show . sunday 's broadcast was the second of its kind at this year 's bayreuth festival . author : kate bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its first webcast of mozart 's " cosi fan tutte " debuts at just a fraction of the live ticket price .
-lrb- 30.07.2009 -rrb- the charm offensive : bayreuth at the dawn of a new era the 98th bayreuth festival has started its process of renewal by turning on the charm and changing its tone after a long war of attrition with the german press .
-lrb- 27.07.2009 -rrb- wagner festival gets a revamp , but is it only skin deep ?
richard wagner 's two great-granddaughters , directors of bayreuth 's renowned opera festival , are repolishing the event .
deutsche welle 's music editor says there 's a lot of new style , but the substance remains to be seen .
-lrb- 26.07.2009 -rrb- feedback would you be more inclined to watch a bayreuth production of a wagner opera via live-stream or public viewing rather than trying to get theater tickets ?

however environmentalists warn that previous climate commitments are way off the mark . delegations from 192 countries are meeting in bonn to continue negotiations towards a global climate deal , which is to be finalised at a much-anticipated un meeting in copenhagen in december .
at the recent g-8 summit in the earthquake-devastated italian town of l 'aquila , developed nations , including the us , promised to limit global warming to two degrees celsius by 2050 .
however , climate experts and environmental groups say even two degrees is far too high and would have cataclysmic consequences .
martin kaiser , who is representing the environmental group greenpeace at the un climate talks , says an increase of two degrees would probably result in the disappearance of the amazon rainforest .
" -lrb- two degrees -rrb- would mean that sea levels would rise by one meter , and it would also mean that much arable land would become so dry that it would no longer be cultivable , " he says .

this third round of talks is intended as an ' informal meeting ' and is being held in bonn , as were the first two rounds . two further conferences are to be held in bangkok in september and october , and then in barcelona at the beginning of november .
the result of the last conference in bonn was a 300-page document with suggestions from the 192 negotiating countries .

disputes continue about who should do what and in what time frame .
there are also questions about who should provide financing for developing nations so that they can also combat the effects of climate change .
yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change , recently told the french news agency afp that the kyoto-replacement climate treaty would be crippled without strong commitments from developed nations and would " defeat the whole purpose of the copenhagen agreement . "
developed nations have been reluctant to agree to concrete commitments without the support of developing nations , especially china and india , two of the world 's fastest growing countries with the world 's two largest populations .
however , china and india say that their commitments should not be equal to those of wealthy countries because their populations are poorer and because they say their nations ' growth would be stilted by restrictions .

however environmentalists warn that previous climate commitments are way off the mark . delegations from 192 countries are meeting in bonn to continue negotiations towards a global climate deal , which is to be finalised at a much-anticipated un meeting in copenhagen in december .
at the recent g-8 summit in the earthquake-devastated italian town of l 'aquila , developed nations , including the us , promised to limit global warming to two degrees celsius by 2050 .
however , climate experts and environmental groups say even two degrees is far too high and would have cataclysmic consequences .
martin kaiser , who is representing the environmental group greenpeace at the un climate talks , says an increase of two degrees would probably result in the disappearance of the amazon rainforest .
" -lrb- two degrees -rrb- would mean that sea levels would rise by one meter , and it would also mean that much arable land would become so dry that it would no longer be cultivable , " he says .
a replacement for kyoto in total , five rounds of preliminary talks will have been held by the time the copenhagen meeting roles around in december .
this third round of talks is intended as an ' informal meeting ' and is being held in bonn , as were the first two rounds . two further conferences are to be held in bangkok in september and october , and then in barcelona at the beginning of november .
the result of the last conference in bonn was a 300-page document with suggestions from the 192 negotiating countries .
the aim of this week 's meeting is to reduce the document to between 50 and 100 pages ; this will then form the basis of discussions in copenhagen .
suggestions abound ; commitments are scarce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests accompanied the last un climate talks in bonn despite the hundreds of pages of suggestions , solid commitments from un member nations have not been forthcoming .
disputes continue about who should do what and in what time frame .
there are also questions about who should provide financing for developing nations so that they can also combat the effects of climate change .
yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change , recently told the french news agency afp that the kyoto-replacement climate treaty would be crippled without strong commitments from developed nations and would " defeat the whole purpose of the copenhagen agreement . "
developed nations have been reluctant to agree to concrete commitments without the support of developing nations , especially china and india , two of the world 's fastest growing countries with the world 's two largest populations .
however , china and india say that their commitments should not be equal to those of wealthy countries because their populations are poorer and because they say their nations ' growth would be stilted by restrictions .

the basque separatist group eta is believed to have been behind the attacks . spanish police officials said they were trying to determine the identities of the people behind the bomb blasts . the attacks are believed to have been carried out by the basque separatist group eta .
only a few clues had emerged on monday and authorities could not say whether the bombers were still on the island or if there was an eta terrorist cell on the island itself . it is also unclear whether sunday 's bombers were the same people responsible for a bomb attack that killed two policemen in july . spain 's king juan carlos has condemned the mallorca bombings saying the attacks would not succeed in damaging spain 's democracy . there is speculation that the attacks may have been meant to draw attention to eta ’ s cause rather than to harm people because all of the bombs contained low levels of explosives and were detonated after warnings had been given , giving the authorities time to clear people from the blast sites .
no injuries were reported . the first of sunday 's bombings occurred at a restaurant on the outskirts of palma de mallorca , near a recreational harbor along the road leading from the city center to the island 's airport .
the explosive was hidden in a backpack in one of the restaurant 's bathrooms . the second explosion came about two hours later in another restaurant about 500 meters -lrb- 546 yards -rrb- from the first .
the third came in a nearby underground supermarket shortly afterwards .
the shopping complex had already been sealed off by police . the origin of a fourth explosion - in a restaurant - was being investigated to find out whether it was a gas explosion or another bomb blast .
overnight police were searching for yet another suspected bomb in a hotel complex in palma de mallorca . bombings followed eta claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first two bombs exploded in restaurants while the third went off in a supermarket the attacks are another blow to the island 's tourism industry and came only hours after eta admitted it was behind bombings that claimed the lives of two civil guard officers and a police inspector and injured dozens more in june and july . the group did not initially claim responsibility for an attack in the mallorcan resort town of palmanova on july 30 , but confirmed in a statement in the basque newspaper , gara , on sunday that it had been behind the car bombing . the explosion killed two civil guard officers who had been driving the vehicle at the time . eta also said it was behind a car bombing in the basque city of bilbao in june which claimed the life of police inspector eduardo puelles garcia . the separatists said garcia had been " the chief of police operations against numerous leftist independence activists and against pro-independence youths for the past decades , and the coordinator of different operations against eta . " eta also said it was behind two other attacks , both in july .
one was a car bombing outside of a police barracks , which injured more than 40 people ; the other an attack on the governing socialist party 's offices in the basque town of durango . ai / mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's another blow to the local tourist industry , with many travelers already concerned about the large number of swine flu cases on the island .
a spokesperson from the german foreign ministry told deutsche welle that the ministry has updated its travel information to make tourists aware of the bombings , with tips such as trying to avoid large crowds .
however , the ministry has not issued a travel warning for mallorca and early indications are that the bombs have not caused tourists to cut short their summer breaks .
sybille zeuch from the german travel association says there is currently no suggestion that the bomb attacks will drive away the 170,000 german tourists now on mallorca .
" what is different from other terrorist attacks is that eta does not want to target tourists and no one has been hurt in these attacks , " zeuch told deutsche welle .
" eta wants to spread fear but they do n't want any victims ; what they want to target is the economy . "
the spanish government has remained defiant , saying the impact on tourism from the blasts will be minimal .
" eta has been trying to inflict damage on the spanish tourism industry for 30 years , " joan mesquida , spain 's state secretary for tourism , said in palma de mallorca on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cordoned off the can tere antoni beach in mallorca after they received bomb warnings allegedly from eta eta responsible ?
all three bombs were planted in ladies ' toilets , indicating that at least one of the attackers was a woman , however police have not yet been unable to formally identify those responsible .
indications are that basque separatist group eta was behind the blasts , after police received warnings earlier in the day that attacks would occur , from someone claiming to be from eta .
the group also admitted responsibility on sunday for a number of recent attacks , including a car bomb on mallorca just over a week ago that killed two civil guards .
thanks to the warnings , no one was hurt in the explosions .
the explosives were also not particularly powerful , leading authorities to believe that the attacks were intended only as a warning and not to cause injury .
authorities are investigating whether the bombs were set off with the use of timers , which would have allowed the devices to be planted several days in advance and given those responsible time to escape .

praised for his musical versatility , he told dw how all musical genres are linked - and what he 's going to do when he retires . martin grubinger has performed in some of the world 's top concert halls , including the koelner philharmonie , the concertgebouw in amsterdam and carnegie hall in new york .
he is currently active in the european summer music festival scene , playing at the salzburg festival in austria and at germany 's schleswig-holstein music festival , where he is an artist in residence . deutsche welle : you 're at home in practically every musical genre .
how did you become such a versatile musician ? martin grubinger : for us percussionists , there 's a logical connection between contemporary music and jazz .
or take salsa , samba , tango , funk , fusion , rock - all of these belong together for us percussionists .
every genre has a connection to all the others and percussion is at home in all these areas . was exactly is the connection between jazz and contemporary music ? contemporary music has a lot to do with percussion because the composers today use a lot of different percussion instruments in their works .
they 're discovering the instrument , both in solo and orchestral contexts - there 's always quite a lot of percussion in contemporary compositions .
without percussion , the music would n't work - without the rhythm and the stringency . can you describe the different challenges that jazz and contemporary music involve ? yes , of course these different types of music have to be approached differently .
with jazz , you are creative and you can do a lot - every evening is different .
in contemporary music , it 's important to the composers that you stay true to the score and actually play what 's written .
that 's crucial because the composers have something particular in mind . if i were to improvise a work by iannis xenakis , for example , it would be a scandal , a falsification .
it would totally miss the composer 's idea .
xenakis mathematically calculates the relationship between the instruments .
that means if you do n't play exactly what 's in the score , the result would be total chaos . with jazz , it 's completely different .
there , you just have to stay within the meter and the harmonies and otherwise you 're pretty much free . bildunterschrift : without percussion , contemporary music would n't work , says grubinger this year , you 're an artist in residence at the schleswig-holstein music festival , where you 've given a wide variety of workshops and concerts and with diverse programs .
all of your concerts were sold out , which earned you the label " audience magnet . " yes , it 's actually really funny .
for us musicians , things happen via friendships and connections .
you hear people when you 're on tour - you sit in concerts and think , he has to play with my ensemble , i want to work with him ! in our case , we 're in a position to bring a big audience into the concert hall , so of course the good musicians want to play with us .
that 's a big advantage , because that way we can gain a lot of quality and expertise in very different areas . the other musicians who work with you have said they really enjoy it .
is there a reciprocal effect with the members of your ensemble ? it 's unbelievable what you can learn on such an evening , you 're sensitized to entirely new things .
as a percussionist , you work in one direction , then there 's a violinist who has a completely different idea of how things should sound and a much bigger palette of colors .
he has a different idea of phrasing and rhythm , and an entirely different perspective on music .
it 's important , then , to learn to say , i want to watch out for those things too . you once said you work with a sports medicine specialist to be able to perform at 100 percent capacity even when your pulse is running at an average of 160 beats per minute during a concert .
you always perform from memory - do you ever have time to relax ? i 'm passionate about cycling and can relax really well when i 'm doing that , or when i 'm playing or watching soccer .
i like to read about socio-political things and i love history .
when i stop playing percussion , i want to study history . interview : magdalene melchers -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

he is currently active in the european summer music festival scene , playing at the salzburg festival in austria and at germany 's schleswig-holstein music festival , where he is an artist in residence . deutsche welle : you 're at home in practically every musical genre .
how did you become such a versatile musician ? martin grubinger : for us percussionists , there 's a logical connection between contemporary music and jazz .
or take salsa , samba , tango , funk , fusion , rock - all of these belong together for us percussionists .
every genre has a connection to all the others and percussion is at home in all these areas . was exactly is the connection between jazz and contemporary music ? contemporary music has a lot to do with percussion because the composers today use a lot of different percussion instruments in their works .
they 're discovering the instrument , both in solo and orchestral contexts - there 's always quite a lot of percussion in contemporary compositions .
without percussion , the music would n't work - without the rhythm and the stringency . can you describe the different challenges that jazz and contemporary music involve ? yes , of course these different types of music have to be approached differently .
with jazz , you are creative and you can do a lot - every evening is different .
in contemporary music , it 's important to the composers that you stay true to the score and actually play what 's written .
that 's crucial because the composers have something particular in mind . if i were to improvise a work by iannis xenakis , for example , it would be a scandal , a falsification .
it would totally miss the composer 's idea .
xenakis mathematically calculates the relationship between the instruments .

praised for his musical versatility , he told dw how all musical genres are linked - and what he 's going to do when he retires . martin grubinger has performed in some of the world 's top concert halls , including the koelner philharmonie , the concertgebouw in amsterdam and carnegie hall in new york .
he is currently active in the european summer music festival scene , playing at the salzburg festival in austria and at germany 's schleswig-holstein music festival , where he is an artist in residence . deutsche welle : you 're at home in practically every musical genre .
how did you become such a versatile musician ? martin grubinger : for us percussionists , there 's a logical connection between contemporary music and jazz .
or take salsa , samba , tango , funk , fusion , rock - all of these belong together for us percussionists .
every genre has a connection to all the others and percussion is at home in all these areas . was exactly is the connection between jazz and contemporary music ? contemporary music has a lot to do with percussion because the composers today use a lot of different percussion instruments in their works .
they 're discovering the instrument , both in solo and orchestral contexts - there 's always quite a lot of percussion in contemporary compositions .
without percussion , the music would n't work - without the rhythm and the stringency . can you describe the different challenges that jazz and contemporary music involve ? yes , of course these different types of music have to be approached differently .
with jazz , you are creative and you can do a lot - every evening is different .
in contemporary music , it 's important to the composers that you stay true to the score and actually play what 's written .
that 's crucial because the composers have something particular in mind . if i were to improvise a work by iannis xenakis , for example , it would be a scandal , a falsification .
it would totally miss the composer 's idea .
xenakis mathematically calculates the relationship between the instruments .
that means if you do n't play exactly what 's in the score , the result would be total chaos . with jazz , it 's completely different .
there , you just have to stay within the meter and the harmonies and otherwise you 're pretty much free . bildunterschrift : without percussion , contemporary music would n't work , says grubinger this year , you 're an artist in residence at the schleswig-holstein music festival , where you 've given a wide variety of workshops and concerts and with diverse programs .

for us musicians , things happen via friendships and connections .
you hear people when you 're on tour - you sit in concerts and think , he has to play with my ensemble , i want to work with him ! in our case , we 're in a position to bring a big audience into the concert hall , so of course the good musicians want to play with us .
that 's a big advantage , because that way we can gain a lot of quality and expertise in very different areas . the other musicians who work with you have said they really enjoy it .
is there a reciprocal effect with the members of your ensemble ? it 's unbelievable what you can learn on such an evening , you 're sensitized to entirely new things .

bayreuth breaks protocol großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opera for the masses opera does n't have to be for the elite , but in bayreuth it always has been .
that the bayreuth festival is taking its wagner operas outside the festspielhaus is n't a novel idea , but it 's a big step for the green hill . some 22,000 people on sunday watched christoph marthaler 's production of the richard wagner opera " tristan and isolde . "
only one in 10 observed standard bayreuth protocol : evening gown and black tie . many of the rest were clad in shorts and sandals and had a cocktail or bratwurst in their hand .
unlike in the theater on the green hill , eating and drinking were permitted during the live broadcast of the performance on bayreuth 's central square . katharina wagner - the newly inaugurated co-director of the festival and great-granddaughter to the composer himself - initiated the public viewing last year and has said she wants to make it a bayreuth tradition . " opera is n't elitist ; it 's entertaining , " katharina wagner told reporters . with free entry and without having to spend years on the theater 's waiting list for tickets , the outdoor version is accessible to more opera fans .
those who watched the live-stream on their computers at home paid 14.90 euros -lrb- $ 21.10 -rrb- .
inside the festspielhaus , those lucky enough to get tickets can pay up to several hundred euros for them . granted , the sound quality outdoors can hardly compare with richard wagner 's specially designed theater .
however , the acoustic experienced was improved over last year 's debut broadcast - this time with 20 speakers running on 138,000 watts , according to the dpa news agency . seven cameras in the theater transported the singers to the 90-square-meter -lrb- 969-square-foot -rrb- led screen in the square .

the basque separatist group eta is believed to have been behind the attacks . spanish police officials said they were trying to determine the identities of the people behind the bomb blasts . the attacks are believed to have been carried out by the basque separatist group eta .
only a few clues had emerged on monday and authorities could not say whether the bombers were still on the island or if there was an eta terrorist cell on the island itself . it is also unclear whether sunday 's bombers were the same people responsible for a bomb attack that killed two policemen in july . spain 's king juan carlos has condemned the mallorca bombings saying the attacks would not succeed in damaging spain 's democracy . there is speculation that the attacks may have been meant to draw attention to eta ’ s cause rather than to harm people because all of the bombs contained low levels of explosives and were detonated after warnings had been given , giving the authorities time to clear people from the blast sites .
no injuries were reported . the first of sunday 's bombings occurred at a restaurant on the outskirts of palma de mallorca , near a recreational harbor along the road leading from the city center to the island 's airport .
the explosive was hidden in a backpack in one of the restaurant 's bathrooms . the second explosion came about two hours later in another restaurant about 500 meters -lrb- 546 yards -rrb- from the first .
the third came in a nearby underground supermarket shortly afterwards .
the shopping complex had already been sealed off by police . the origin of a fourth explosion - in a restaurant - was being investigated to find out whether it was a gas explosion or another bomb blast .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 10.08.2009 international partners watch south american summit with interest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 12-nation unasur meets to discuss common issues the summit of the union of south american nations -lrb- unasur -rrb- in quito , ecuador brought together the heads of state of the 12-member bloc to discuss the economic crisis , regional security and other common issues . unasur was set up in 2008 , bringing together argentina , bolivia , brazil , chile , colombia , ecuador , guyana , paraguay , peru , suriname , uruguay and venezuela in a new union after its predecessor , the south american community of nations -lrb- csn -rrb- , became defunct in 2007 .
unasur was launched to promote integration among south american countries and as such has a number of initiatives at its heart which intend to consolidate trade , security and infrastructure policies across its member states .
among many of the initiatives set up at its creation , unasur aims to create a single market to eliminate the fees for non-sensitive products by 2014 and for sensitive products -lrb- i.e. , beef , dairy -rrb- by 2019 .
unasur is also pursuing an initiative for infrastructure integration of south america -lrb- iirsa -rrb- , including the construction of the inter-oceanic highway to link the pacific coast countries to allow better connections with bolivia , argentina , peru and brazil .
the presidency of unasur rotates on an annual basis , and is currently held by chilean president michelle bachelet .
the presidency will be handed to ecuador during the summit held in its capital .
the outcomes of the 2009 unasur summit are likely to have a wider significance outside of south america , with the european union and germany in particular interested in the bloc 's discussions .
as well as developments in trade relations , germany will be looking at the increased collaboration within unasur with a view to possible effects this may have on its bilateral relations .
germany 's interests feature heavily on trade out of the 12 unasur countries , germany is closest , in terms of trade and political dialogue , with brazil .
brazil is germany 's main trade partner in the unasur , with seven percent of brazilian imports coming from germany , making it brazil 's main trading partner in the eu , while five percent of brazilian exports come to germany , second only to the netherlands within the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and lula have a tight trading partnership " brazil is germany 's main partner within this country-group , " claudia zilla , a latin america expert with the americas research division at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" germany imports iron ore , auto parts , machinery , coffee , soy , animal feed , chemical products , oil , paper pulp , meat and metals from brazil .
brazil imports machinery , chemical products , auto parts , electro technology , and medicine from germany . "
zilla explained that , while trade - specifically with brazil - is an important part of germany 's involvement in south america , it is far from being its only commitment .
berlin sees opportunities to forge partnerships on a number of global issues with south american governments within unasur .
in terms of international development cooperation with south america , germany 's main partners in bilateral programs are peru , ecuador , colombia , brazil , and particularly bolivia .
partnerships pursued ; opportunities missed " besides investment and trade , germany is interested in global governance , " zilla said .
" in some policy areas like environment and energy , south american countries have high potential to become partners in global cooperation .
germany and south america share important values like multilateralism and peaceful conflict resolution .
but this does not mean both parts exploit these opportunities .
there is a lack of sustainable engagement and strategic coordination between both sides on an international level .
bildunterschrift : germany actively seeks cooperation with unasur members but opportunities are often squandered " democratic values are always an important component of germany 's partnership programs , of political dialogue and international economic cooperation , " she added .
" but it does not mean that the intensity of germany 's relationship with south american countries goes hand in hand with their democratic quality . "
" on the one hand , some cooperation with less democratic countries can be a valuable contribution to deeper democratization .
on the other hand , latin american democracies are not frozen political systems , but dynamic ones .
this makes things tough at times , as it is not easy to constantly adapt foreign relations to the changes in each country , " she said .
while common policies on tackling the effects of the global financial crisis and issues of trade and security are the main topics for the 2009 meeting , the summit is likely to be overshadowed by the row simmering between a number of unasur 's members over colombia 's plans to allow the united states use of seven military bases in its territory .
the official reason given for the us approach by alvaro uribe 's government is the fight against drug trafficking , which fuels the activities of leftist colombian rebels that have been fighting the state for more than 40 years .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , a long-time antagonist of uribe , has voiced strong opposition to colombia 's plans , and moved to freeze ties with bogota as well as recalling the venezuelan ambassador .
he considers the narcotics interdiction a pretense , and has accused the us of seeking to establish colombia as a " yankee " platform for attacks on other countries in latin america .
berlin unlikely to comment on us base plan for colombia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela and germany have a low-level relationship germany has a low-level relationship with venezuela and as such is highly unlikely to get involved in any spat over us influence in colombia .
venezuela 's trade dealings are focused on the united states while chavez 's foreign policy has a strong south-south-dimension , oriented toward his own region or toward non-eu countries like iran and russia .
" i can not imagine that germany would see anything wrong with -lrb- colombia 's plan -rrb- .
the us has had its own military base in manta for a long time , " said zilla .
" now the us is looking for alternatives after ecuador decided not to renew the lease on the base , it makes sense that -lrb- colombian president alvaro -rrb- uribe is willing to let the us use colombian bases . "
as is often the case , chavez is the most outspoken critic of us plans in latin america , but other leaders around the region have expressed reservations too after uribe toured seven south american countries to explain his plans last week .
brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva demanded formal guarantees that the planned deal between bogota and washington would not allow the use of colombian bases to launch actions on other countries in the region .
" it is essential to grant some kind of formal guarantee , a legal guarantee , that possible -lrb- us military -rrb- operations will happen strictly within colombian territory , " brazilian presidential spokesman marcelo baumbach stressed last friday .
" there is a suggestion for there to be greater transparency , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim had said earlier .
according to amorim , lula hopes all doubts can be dispelled " calmly , based on technical considerations " at the unasur summit .
lula stressed that he favors " bilateral and multilateral cooperation between south american nations to combat drug trafficking , without external interferences . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and lula have a tight trading partnership " brazil is germany 's main partner within this country-group , " claudia zilla , a latin america expert with the americas research division at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" germany imports iron ore , auto parts , machinery , coffee , soy , animal feed , chemical products , oil , paper pulp , meat and metals from brazil .
brazil imports machinery , chemical products , auto parts , electro technology , and medicine from germany . "
zilla explained that , while trade - specifically with brazil - is an important part of germany 's involvement in south america , it is far from being its only commitment .
berlin sees opportunities to forge partnerships on a number of global issues with south american governments within unasur .
in terms of international development cooperation with south america , germany 's main partners in bilateral programs are peru , ecuador , colombia , brazil , and particularly bolivia .
partnerships pursued ; opportunities missed " besides investment and trade , germany is interested in global governance , " zilla said .
" in some policy areas like environment and energy , south american countries have high potential to become partners in global cooperation .
germany and south america share important values like multilateralism and peaceful conflict resolution .
but this does not mean both parts exploit these opportunities .
there is a lack of sustainable engagement and strategic coordination between both sides on an international level .
bildunterschrift : germany actively seeks cooperation with unasur members but opportunities are often squandered " democratic values are always an important component of germany 's partnership programs , of political dialogue and international economic cooperation , " she added .
" but it does not mean that the intensity of germany 's relationship with south american countries goes hand in hand with their democratic quality . "
" on the one hand , some cooperation with less democratic countries can be a valuable contribution to deeper democratization .
on the other hand , latin american democracies are not frozen political systems , but dynamic ones .
this makes things tough at times , as it is not easy to constantly adapt foreign relations to the changes in each country , " she said .
while common policies on tackling the effects of the global financial crisis and issues of trade and security are the main topics for the 2009 meeting , the summit is likely to be overshadowed by the row simmering between a number of unasur 's members over colombia 's plans to allow the united states use of seven military bases in its territory .
the official reason given for the us approach by alvaro uribe 's government is the fight against drug trafficking , which fuels the activities of leftist colombian rebels that have been fighting the state for more than 40 years .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , a long-time antagonist of uribe , has voiced strong opposition to colombia 's plans , and moved to freeze ties with bogota as well as recalling the venezuelan ambassador .
he considers the narcotics interdiction a pretense , and has accused the us of seeking to establish colombia as a " yankee " platform for attacks on other countries in latin america .
berlin unlikely to comment on us base plan for colombia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela and germany have a low-level relationship germany has a low-level relationship with venezuela and as such is highly unlikely to get involved in any spat over us influence in colombia .
venezuela 's trade dealings are focused on the united states while chavez 's foreign policy has a strong south-south-dimension , oriented toward his own region or toward non-eu countries like iran and russia .
" i can not imagine that germany would see anything wrong with -lrb- colombia 's plan -rrb- .
the us has had its own military base in manta for a long time , " said zilla .
" now the us is looking for alternatives after ecuador decided not to renew the lease on the base , it makes sense that -lrb- colombian president alvaro -rrb- uribe is willing to let the us use colombian bases . "
as is often the case , chavez is the most outspoken critic of us plans in latin america , but other leaders around the region have expressed reservations too after uribe toured seven south american countries to explain his plans last week .
brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva demanded formal guarantees that the planned deal between bogota and washington would not allow the use of colombian bases to launch actions on other countries in the region .
" it is essential to grant some kind of formal guarantee , a legal guarantee , that possible -lrb- us military -rrb- operations will happen strictly within colombian territory , " brazilian presidential spokesman marcelo baumbach stressed last friday .
" there is a suggestion for there to be greater transparency , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim had said earlier .
according to amorim , lula hopes all doubts can be dispelled " calmly , based on technical considerations " at the unasur summit .
lula stressed that he favors " bilateral and multilateral cooperation between south american nations to combat drug trafficking , without external interferences . "

unasur was launched to promote integration among south american countries and as such has a number of initiatives at its heart which intend to consolidate trade , security and infrastructure policies across its member states .
among many of the initiatives set up at its creation , unasur aims to create a single market to eliminate the fees for non-sensitive products by 2014 and for sensitive products -lrb- i.e. , beef , dairy -rrb- by 2019 .
unasur is also pursuing an initiative for infrastructure integration of south america -lrb- iirsa -rrb- , including the construction of the inter-oceanic highway to link the pacific coast countries to allow better connections with bolivia , argentina , peru and brazil .
the presidency of unasur rotates on an annual basis , and is currently held by chilean president michelle bachelet .
the presidency will be handed to ecuador during the summit held in its capital .
the outcomes of the 2009 unasur summit are likely to have a wider significance outside of south america , with the european union and germany in particular interested in the bloc 's discussions .
as well as developments in trade relations , germany will be looking at the increased collaboration within unasur with a view to possible effects this may have on its bilateral relations .

venezuela 's trade dealings are focused on the united states while chavez 's foreign policy has a strong south-south-dimension , oriented toward his own region or toward non-eu countries like iran and russia .
" i can not imagine that germany would see anything wrong with -lrb- colombia 's plan -rrb- .
the us has had its own military base in manta for a long time , " said zilla .
" now the us is looking for alternatives after ecuador decided not to renew the lease on the base , it makes sense that -lrb- colombian president alvaro -rrb- uribe is willing to let the us use colombian bases . "
as is often the case , chavez is the most outspoken critic of us plans in latin america , but other leaders around the region have expressed reservations too after uribe toured seven south american countries to explain his plans last week .
brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva demanded formal guarantees that the planned deal between bogota and washington would not allow the use of colombian bases to launch actions on other countries in the region .
" it is essential to grant some kind of formal guarantee , a legal guarantee , that possible -lrb- us military -rrb- operations will happen strictly within colombian territory , " brazilian presidential spokesman marcelo baumbach stressed last friday .
" there is a suggestion for there to be greater transparency , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim had said earlier .
according to amorim , lula hopes all doubts can be dispelled " calmly , based on technical considerations " at the unasur summit .
lula stressed that he favors " bilateral and multilateral cooperation between south american nations to combat drug trafficking , without external interferences . "

however environmentalists warn that previous climate commitments are way off the mark . delegations from 192 countries are meeting in bonn to continue negotiations towards a global climate deal , which is to be finalised at a much-anticipated un meeting in copenhagen in december .
at the recent g-8 summit in the earthquake-devastated italian town of l 'aquila , developed nations , including the us , promised to limit global warming to two degrees celsius by 2050 .
however , climate experts and environmental groups say even two degrees is far too high and would have cataclysmic consequences .
martin kaiser , who is representing the environmental group greenpeace at the un climate talks , says an increase of two degrees would probably result in the disappearance of the amazon rainforest .
" -lrb- two degrees -rrb- would mean that sea levels would rise by one meter , and it would also mean that much arable land would become so dry that it would no longer be cultivable , " he says .

the result of the last conference in bonn was a 300-page document with suggestions from the 192 negotiating countries .

there are also questions about who should provide financing for developing nations so that they can also combat the effects of climate change .
yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change , recently told the french news agency afp that the kyoto-replacement climate treaty would be crippled without strong commitments from developed nations and would " defeat the whole purpose of the copenhagen agreement . "
developed nations have been reluctant to agree to concrete commitments without the support of developing nations , especially china and india , two of the world 's fastest growing countries with the world 's two largest populations .
however , china and india say that their commitments should not be equal to those of wealthy countries because their populations are poorer and because they say their nations ' growth would be stilted by restrictions .

however environmentalists warn that previous climate commitments are way off the mark . delegations from 192 countries are meeting in bonn to continue negotiations towards a global climate deal , which is to be finalised at a much-anticipated un meeting in copenhagen in december .
at the recent g-8 summit in the earthquake-devastated italian town of l 'aquila , developed nations , including the us , promised to limit global warming to two degrees celsius by 2050 .
however , climate experts and environmental groups say even two degrees is far too high and would have cataclysmic consequences .
martin kaiser , who is representing the environmental group greenpeace at the un climate talks , says an increase of two degrees would probably result in the disappearance of the amazon rainforest .
" -lrb- two degrees -rrb- would mean that sea levels would rise by one meter , and it would also mean that much arable land would become so dry that it would no longer be cultivable , " he says .
a replacement for kyoto in total , five rounds of preliminary talks will have been held by the time the copenhagen meeting roles around in december .
this third round of talks is intended as an ' informal meeting ' and is being held in bonn , as were the first two rounds . two further conferences are to be held in bangkok in september and october , and then in barcelona at the beginning of november .
the result of the last conference in bonn was a 300-page document with suggestions from the 192 negotiating countries .
the aim of this week 's meeting is to reduce the document to between 50 and 100 pages ; this will then form the basis of discussions in copenhagen .
suggestions abound ; commitments are scarce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests accompanied the last un climate talks in bonn despite the hundreds of pages of suggestions , solid commitments from un member nations have not been forthcoming .
disputes continue about who should do what and in what time frame .
there are also questions about who should provide financing for developing nations so that they can also combat the effects of climate change .
yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change , recently told the french news agency afp that the kyoto-replacement climate treaty would be crippled without strong commitments from developed nations and would " defeat the whole purpose of the copenhagen agreement . "
developed nations have been reluctant to agree to concrete commitments without the support of developing nations , especially china and india , two of the world 's fastest growing countries with the world 's two largest populations .
however , china and india say that their commitments should not be equal to those of wealthy countries because their populations are poorer and because they say their nations ' growth would be stilted by restrictions .

it 's another blow to the local tourist industry , with many travelers already concerned about the large number of swine flu cases on the island .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 10.08.2009 spanish police search for suspected eta bombers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta appears to be stepping up its bombing campaign spanish police are searching for suspects behind a number of bomb blasts on the spanish island of mallorca on sunday .
the basque separatist group eta is believed to have been behind the attacks . spanish police officials said they were trying to determine the identities of the people behind the bomb blasts . the attacks are believed to have been carried out by the basque separatist group eta .
only a few clues had emerged on monday and authorities could not say whether the bombers were still on the island or if there was an eta terrorist cell on the island itself . it is also unclear whether sunday 's bombers were the same people responsible for a bomb attack that killed two policemen in july . spain 's king juan carlos has condemned the mallorca bombings saying the attacks would not succeed in damaging spain 's democracy . there is speculation that the attacks may have been meant to draw attention to eta ’ s cause rather than to harm people because all of the bombs contained low levels of explosives and were detonated after warnings had been given , giving the authorities time to clear people from the blast sites .
no injuries were reported . the first of sunday 's bombings occurred at a restaurant on the outskirts of palma de mallorca , near a recreational harbor along the road leading from the city center to the island 's airport .
the explosive was hidden in a backpack in one of the restaurant 's bathrooms . the second explosion came about two hours later in another restaurant about 500 meters -lrb- 546 yards -rrb- from the first .
the third came in a nearby underground supermarket shortly afterwards .
the shopping complex had already been sealed off by police . the origin of a fourth explosion - in a restaurant - was being investigated to find out whether it was a gas explosion or another bomb blast .
overnight police were searching for yet another suspected bomb in a hotel complex in palma de mallorca . bombings followed eta claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first two bombs exploded in restaurants while the third went off in a supermarket the attacks are another blow to the island 's tourism industry and came only hours after eta admitted it was behind bombings that claimed the lives of two civil guard officers and a police inspector and injured dozens more in june and july . the group did not initially claim responsibility for an attack in the mallorcan resort town of palmanova on july 30 , but confirmed in a statement in the basque newspaper , gara , on sunday that it had been behind the car bombing . the explosion killed two civil guard officers who had been driving the vehicle at the time . eta also said it was behind a car bombing in the basque city of bilbao in june which claimed the life of police inspector eduardo puelles garcia . the separatists said garcia had been " the chief of police operations against numerous leftist independence activists and against pro-independence youths for the past decades , and the coordinator of different operations against eta . " eta also said it was behind two other attacks , both in july .
one was a car bombing outside of a police barracks , which injured more than 40 people ; the other an attack on the governing socialist party 's offices in the basque town of durango . ai / mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all three bombs were planted in ladies ' toilets , indicating that at least one of the attackers was a woman , however police have not yet been unable to formally identify those responsible .
indications are that basque separatist group eta was behind the blasts , after police received warnings earlier in the day that attacks would occur , from someone claiming to be from eta .
the group also admitted responsibility on sunday for a number of recent attacks , including a car bomb on mallorca just over a week ago that killed two civil guards .
thanks to the warnings , no one was hurt in the explosions .
the explosives were also not particularly powerful , leading authorities to believe that the attacks were intended only as a warning and not to cause injury .
authorities are investigating whether the bombs were set off with the use of timers , which would have allowed the devices to be planted several days in advance and given those responsible time to escape .

unasur was launched to promote integration among south american countries and as such has a number of initiatives at its heart which intend to consolidate trade , security and infrastructure policies across its member states .
among many of the initiatives set up at its creation , unasur aims to create a single market to eliminate the fees for non-sensitive products by 2014 and for sensitive products -lrb- i.e. , beef , dairy -rrb- by 2019 .
unasur is also pursuing an initiative for infrastructure integration of south america -lrb- iirsa -rrb- , including the construction of the inter-oceanic highway to link the pacific coast countries to allow better connections with bolivia , argentina , peru and brazil .
the presidency of unasur rotates on an annual basis , and is currently held by chilean president michelle bachelet .
the presidency will be handed to ecuador during the summit held in its capital .
the outcomes of the 2009 unasur summit are likely to have a wider significance outside of south america , with the european union and germany in particular interested in the bloc 's discussions .
as well as developments in trade relations , germany will be looking at the increased collaboration within unasur with a view to possible effects this may have on its bilateral relations .
germany 's interests feature heavily on trade out of the 12 unasur countries , germany is closest , in terms of trade and political dialogue , with brazil .
brazil is germany 's main trade partner in the unasur , with seven percent of brazilian imports coming from germany , making it brazil 's main trading partner in the eu , while five percent of brazilian exports come to germany , second only to the netherlands within the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and lula have a tight trading partnership " brazil is germany 's main partner within this country-group , " claudia zilla , a latin america expert with the americas research division at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" germany imports iron ore , auto parts , machinery , coffee , soy , animal feed , chemical products , oil , paper pulp , meat and metals from brazil .
brazil imports machinery , chemical products , auto parts , electro technology , and medicine from germany . "
zilla explained that , while trade - specifically with brazil - is an important part of germany 's involvement in south america , it is far from being its only commitment .
berlin sees opportunities to forge partnerships on a number of global issues with south american governments within unasur .
in terms of international development cooperation with south america , germany 's main partners in bilateral programs are peru , ecuador , colombia , brazil , and particularly bolivia .
partnerships pursued ; opportunities missed " besides investment and trade , germany is interested in global governance , " zilla said .
" in some policy areas like environment and energy , south american countries have high potential to become partners in global cooperation .
germany and south america share important values like multilateralism and peaceful conflict resolution .
but this does not mean both parts exploit these opportunities .
there is a lack of sustainable engagement and strategic coordination between both sides on an international level .
bildunterschrift : germany actively seeks cooperation with unasur members but opportunities are often squandered " democratic values are always an important component of germany 's partnership programs , of political dialogue and international economic cooperation , " she added .
" but it does not mean that the intensity of germany 's relationship with south american countries goes hand in hand with their democratic quality . "
" on the one hand , some cooperation with less democratic countries can be a valuable contribution to deeper democratization .
on the other hand , latin american democracies are not frozen political systems , but dynamic ones .
this makes things tough at times , as it is not easy to constantly adapt foreign relations to the changes in each country , " she said .
while common policies on tackling the effects of the global financial crisis and issues of trade and security are the main topics for the 2009 meeting , the summit is likely to be overshadowed by the row simmering between a number of unasur 's members over colombia 's plans to allow the united states use of seven military bases in its territory .
the official reason given for the us approach by alvaro uribe 's government is the fight against drug trafficking , which fuels the activities of leftist colombian rebels that have been fighting the state for more than 40 years .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , a long-time antagonist of uribe , has voiced strong opposition to colombia 's plans , and moved to freeze ties with bogota as well as recalling the venezuelan ambassador .
he considers the narcotics interdiction a pretense , and has accused the us of seeking to establish colombia as a " yankee " platform for attacks on other countries in latin america .
berlin unlikely to comment on us base plan for colombia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela and germany have a low-level relationship germany has a low-level relationship with venezuela and as such is highly unlikely to get involved in any spat over us influence in colombia .
venezuela 's trade dealings are focused on the united states while chavez 's foreign policy has a strong south-south-dimension , oriented toward his own region or toward non-eu countries like iran and russia .
" i can not imagine that germany would see anything wrong with -lrb- colombia 's plan -rrb- .
the us has had its own military base in manta for a long time , " said zilla .
" now the us is looking for alternatives after ecuador decided not to renew the lease on the base , it makes sense that -lrb- colombian president alvaro -rrb- uribe is willing to let the us use colombian bases . "
as is often the case , chavez is the most outspoken critic of us plans in latin america , but other leaders around the region have expressed reservations too after uribe toured seven south american countries to explain his plans last week .
brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva demanded formal guarantees that the planned deal between bogota and washington would not allow the use of colombian bases to launch actions on other countries in the region .
" it is essential to grant some kind of formal guarantee , a legal guarantee , that possible -lrb- us military -rrb- operations will happen strictly within colombian territory , " brazilian presidential spokesman marcelo baumbach stressed last friday .
" there is a suggestion for there to be greater transparency , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim had said earlier .
according to amorim , lula hopes all doubts can be dispelled " calmly , based on technical considerations " at the unasur summit .
lula stressed that he favors " bilateral and multilateral cooperation between south american nations to combat drug trafficking , without external interferences . "

unasur was launched to promote integration among south american countries and as such has a number of initiatives at its heart which intend to consolidate trade , security and infrastructure policies across its member states .
among many of the initiatives set up at its creation , unasur aims to create a single market to eliminate the fees for non-sensitive products by 2014 and for sensitive products -lrb- i.e. , beef , dairy -rrb- by 2019 .
unasur is also pursuing an initiative for infrastructure integration of south america -lrb- iirsa -rrb- , including the construction of the inter-oceanic highway to link the pacific coast countries to allow better connections with bolivia , argentina , peru and brazil .
the presidency of unasur rotates on an annual basis , and is currently held by chilean president michelle bachelet .
the presidency will be handed to ecuador during the summit held in its capital .
the outcomes of the 2009 unasur summit are likely to have a wider significance outside of south america , with the european union and germany in particular interested in the bloc 's discussions .
as well as developments in trade relations , germany will be looking at the increased collaboration within unasur with a view to possible effects this may have on its bilateral relations .
germany 's interests feature heavily on trade out of the 12 unasur countries , germany is closest , in terms of trade and political dialogue , with brazil .
brazil is germany 's main trade partner in the unasur , with seven percent of brazilian imports coming from germany , making it brazil 's main trading partner in the eu , while five percent of brazilian exports come to germany , second only to the netherlands within the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and lula have a tight trading partnership " brazil is germany 's main partner within this country-group , " claudia zilla , a latin america expert with the americas research division at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" germany imports iron ore , auto parts , machinery , coffee , soy , animal feed , chemical products , oil , paper pulp , meat and metals from brazil .
brazil imports machinery , chemical products , auto parts , electro technology , and medicine from germany . "
zilla explained that , while trade - specifically with brazil - is an important part of germany 's involvement in south america , it is far from being its only commitment .
berlin sees opportunities to forge partnerships on a number of global issues with south american governments within unasur .
in terms of international development cooperation with south america , germany 's main partners in bilateral programs are peru , ecuador , colombia , brazil , and particularly bolivia .
partnerships pursued ; opportunities missed " besides investment and trade , germany is interested in global governance , " zilla said .
" in some policy areas like environment and energy , south american countries have high potential to become partners in global cooperation .
germany and south america share important values like multilateralism and peaceful conflict resolution .
but this does not mean both parts exploit these opportunities .
there is a lack of sustainable engagement and strategic coordination between both sides on an international level .
bildunterschrift : germany actively seeks cooperation with unasur members but opportunities are often squandered " democratic values are always an important component of germany 's partnership programs , of political dialogue and international economic cooperation , " she added .
" but it does not mean that the intensity of germany 's relationship with south american countries goes hand in hand with their democratic quality . "
" on the one hand , some cooperation with less democratic countries can be a valuable contribution to deeper democratization .
on the other hand , latin american democracies are not frozen political systems , but dynamic ones .
this makes things tough at times , as it is not easy to constantly adapt foreign relations to the changes in each country , " she said .
while common policies on tackling the effects of the global financial crisis and issues of trade and security are the main topics for the 2009 meeting , the summit is likely to be overshadowed by the row simmering between a number of unasur 's members over colombia 's plans to allow the united states use of seven military bases in its territory .
the official reason given for the us approach by alvaro uribe 's government is the fight against drug trafficking , which fuels the activities of leftist colombian rebels that have been fighting the state for more than 40 years .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , a long-time antagonist of uribe , has voiced strong opposition to colombia 's plans , and moved to freeze ties with bogota as well as recalling the venezuelan ambassador .
he considers the narcotics interdiction a pretense , and has accused the us of seeking to establish colombia as a " yankee " platform for attacks on other countries in latin america .
berlin unlikely to comment on us base plan for colombia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela and germany have a low-level relationship germany has a low-level relationship with venezuela and as such is highly unlikely to get involved in any spat over us influence in colombia .
venezuela 's trade dealings are focused on the united states while chavez 's foreign policy has a strong south-south-dimension , oriented toward his own region or toward non-eu countries like iran and russia .
" i can not imagine that germany would see anything wrong with -lrb- colombia 's plan -rrb- .
the us has had its own military base in manta for a long time , " said zilla .
" now the us is looking for alternatives after ecuador decided not to renew the lease on the base , it makes sense that -lrb- colombian president alvaro -rrb- uribe is willing to let the us use colombian bases . "
as is often the case , chavez is the most outspoken critic of us plans in latin america , but other leaders around the region have expressed reservations too after uribe toured seven south american countries to explain his plans last week .
brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva demanded formal guarantees that the planned deal between bogota and washington would not allow the use of colombian bases to launch actions on other countries in the region .
" it is essential to grant some kind of formal guarantee , a legal guarantee , that possible -lrb- us military -rrb- operations will happen strictly within colombian territory , " brazilian presidential spokesman marcelo baumbach stressed last friday .
" there is a suggestion for there to be greater transparency , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim had said earlier .
according to amorim , lula hopes all doubts can be dispelled " calmly , based on technical considerations " at the unasur summit .
lula stressed that he favors " bilateral and multilateral cooperation between south american nations to combat drug trafficking , without external interferences . "

three bomb blasts on mallorca are the latest attacks on the popular tourist destination .
while all signs point to the involvement of eta , authorities have not officially named the group over sunday 's bombings . to learn more about the eta and their strategies , deutsche welle interviewed professor paul heywood , an expert on the basque separatist group at the university of nottingham in the united kingdom .
dw : the authorities have yet to conclusively link eta to sunday 's three bomb blasts .
is there any doubt about their involvement ? paul heywood : it is almost certain this was the work of eta , they had released statements the day before about a series of previous attacks that had taken place in june and july and these latest attacks follow a very similar pattern , including two attacks on holiday resorts in the past .
from your knowledge of the way eta operates , would they have had an active cell on the island , or would they have sent in people from the mainland ?
they probably sent people in from the mainland .
now there was , of course , the assassination of two civil guards on the island in palmanova on 30th july and these bombs that went off yesterday -lrb- sunday ed . -rrb- were all on timer devices , so it is just possible that the cell which carried out the assassinations just over a week ago also planted the bombs , though it 's a long time for bombs to be on timer devices , it 's more likely that they 've still got some people on the island .
how successful have the spanish authorities been in the past in tracking down eta bombers ?
well there have been a lot of high profile arrests of eta leaders and there 's been in recent years much more effective collaboration with the french authorities , so that the french and the spanish police have worked together to capture some of the top eta leaders .
however one of the issues - it can hardly be overstressed with any organization like eta - is that they are not single organizations where there is one leadership and if you capture that leadership then the organization is undermined .
these organizations operate on the basis of numbers of different cells which operate according to different command structures within different parts of the country , and indeed , they are often characterized by splits within the organization , so eta , just like a lot of other terrorist organizations , has historically had splits between an official leadership - quite often wanting dialogue and political interaction with the government - and more militant , often younger members , who are against dialogue and want to continue the campaign of violence .
what is likely to be the impact on spain 's tourism industry ? that 's what they are aiming for - to hurt spain 's tourism industry - this is a form of economic terrorism .
the targets are not members of the public , still less actual tourists .
eta has a history of mainly targeting members of the spanish armed forces or police and recent assassinations which have taken place have been of members of the civil guard .
eta has never really gone for soft targets in the sense of members of the public or holidaymakers , tourists .
but what they do want to do to is to instil a sense of fear so that people think twice about whether they are going to visit spain on holiday and in that sense create an economic climate for the government , which of course is already struggling with the impact of recession , which makes it much more difficult for them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 10.08.2009 suspected leader of sauerland terror cell confesses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz gelowicz , the alleged mastermind behind the sauerland cell , confessed to planning terror attacks in germany the first of four alleged islamist militants known as the sauerland cell took the stand to confess his role in planning terror attacks in germany .
the confessions are expected to shorten the trial of the four men . in his wide-ranging confession , suspected ring leader fritz gelowicz told the court how the group 's plans for a terror attack in germany developed .
according to his confession in a duesseldorf court , the alleged mastermind of the group took part in a three-month terrorist training camp in pakistan in 2006 .
there , a plot was hatched to attack american targets , particularly military personnel , in germany .
part of the training dealt with weapons , such as kalashnikov machine guns , and the suspects were also reportedly trained in explosives and circuitry for bomb making .
prosecution lawyer volker brinkmann said ahead of the trial that the suspects had admitted to their goal of " killing as many americans as possible . "
unprecedented confessions the members of the so-called sauerland terror cell have been questioned by police for the past four weeks since the court adjourned for its summer recess .
their written testimonies now run to over 1,500 pages .
the confessions are more extensive than expected and they are likely to speed up the trial and reduce the sentences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presiding judge ottmar breidling called the wide-ranging confessions " impressive " chief judge ottmar breidling said the questioning during the four-week break had revealed an unexpectedly " impressive " range of information .
international security expert michael lueders says the confessions could significantly reduce the length of the trial .
" in the beginning , there was talk of two years for this process , but now people talk about three or four months , " lueders told deutsche welle .
this is one of the biggest terrorism trials in germany since those involving the urban guerrillas of the red army faction in the 1970s .
suspects accused of planning massive attacks the men allegedly formed their terror cell for the islamic jihad union and stand accused of plotting at least three bomb attacks in german cities targeting us citizens .
authorities say the group aimed to carry out attacks as deadly as those of september 11 , 2001 which killed around 3,000 people in the united states .
two of the suspects , gelowicz and daniel schneider , aged 29 and 23 respectively , are german converts to islam .
a third suspect , attila selek , is a 24-year-old german citizen of turkish origin , while 30-year-old adem yilmaz is a turkish national .
the threat of ' home grown ' terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the suspects were arrested in september 2007 with hydrogen peroxide drums the sauerland cell is named after a western german region where three of the men were apprehended in september 2007 along with 26 detonators and 12 drums of hydrogen peroxide , a substance used in the deadly attacks on london 's transport system two years earlier .
selek was later caught in turkey .
although the men were apprehended before any attacks took place , the fact that such ' home grown ' terrorists may pose a real threat in germany is a major cause for concern , says international security expert michael lueders .
" not everyone who converts to islam is radical , but some people are , and this is really a room for concern for most security analysts in germany , " said lueders , " and nobody really knows how to solve this issue .
so these so-called converts are really targeted by police . "
if convicted , the suspected terrorists could face up to 15 years in prison. mz / dpa / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

throughout the most recent dispute with iran he has continually called for restraint .
but his patience seems to have worn thin .
the immediate reason for this is the trial in tehran against a frenchwoman and two iranian employees of the french and the british embassies .
they are all accused of spying against iran and taking part in efforts to topple the islamic system .
in an interview , mr bildt said it was a show trial .
“ i 've protested very sharply on behalf of the european union .
this is not against individual persons or countries but against the european union as a whole , and this is exactly how we are treating this matter , ” said bildt .
bildt 's comments were not received well in tehran .
hassan ghashghavi , a spokesman for the iranian foreign ministry , reacted by saying it was beyond any legal logic to claim a trial in one country would simultaneously challenge 27 other countries .
ghashgavi added that iran had never interfered in elections or trials in the eu and expected the eu to do the same .
he rejected eu calls to let the defendants go free .
“ the islamic republic of iran will stand firm against irrational demands , “ said gashghavi .
eu nations also criticize trials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clotilde reiss in the dock a spokeswoman for the british foreign office called the decision to put the british embasssy 's chief political analyst , hossein rassam on trial , fully unacceptable .
in a statement released by the french foreign ministry , the french called the accusations against reiss " without foundation . "
paris has categorically denied espionage charges levied against reiss , a lecturer at a university in iran .
clotilde reiss , a french lecturer , has confessed that she supplied information on post-election protests to foreign embassies .
the iranian employee of the british embassy has said he was sent to attend and monitor the demonstrations .
eu diplomats have suggested that the accused have made these statements under pressure .

ghashgavi added that iran had never interfered in elections or trials in the eu and expected the eu to do the same .
he rejected eu calls to let the defendants go free .

but the indigenous communities are using both ancient knowledge and modern technology to protect biodiversity and stop further destruction . the lush green of the rain forest offers rich natural resources which the ashaninka indians have lived on for centuries .
at the yoreka atame school of primeval forestry in brazil , young indigenous and non-indigenous people have been learning how to make use of them in a sustainable way . since 2007 , the school has taught more than 2,000 participants skills like the cultivating fruit trees , keeping bees , and erecting dams in creeks and lakes to enhance spawning grounds for fish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cultivating traditional plants is part of the curriculum " that 's how we ashaninka indians here in the border region between brazil and peru want to pass on our traditional knowledge , " said moises piyako .
he cofounded the yoreka atame school together with his brother benki in 2007 . illegal logging threatens biodiversity political problems between brazil and its neighbor peru make life complicated for the indigenous people in the border region . " we are suffering from peruvian logging companies , and now the peruvian government also wants to dig for oil along the border , " said moises piyako . illegal timber-fellers from peru are increasingly encroaching on the rainforest on both sides of the border . the land and its resources belong to the ashaninka , according to the indigenous and tribal peoples convention 169 adopted by the international labour organisation , ilo .
it recognizes the rights of ownership of the peoples over the lands which they traditionally occupy .
but peru has been trying to circumnavigate international law by granting mining concessions for areas that are owned by indigenous peoples . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ashaninka live in the border region between brazil and peru " in the process , peruvian timber companies even illegally enter brazilian territory , " said ashaninka spokesman benki piyako .
" illegal logging is putting our whole region and its biodiversity at risk . " the invasion of ashaninka rainforests by illegal loggers started in 2001 with a company called forestal venao , which is owned by the daughter of the former peruvian president , alberto fujimori .
he was recently put on trial for corruption and has already been convicted to 25 years in prison for severe human rights violations and killing opposition politicians . his daughter , keiko fujimori , has announced her candidacy for the presidency as well as her aim to officially pardon her father should she come to power .
her political campaign is partially funded by the earnings from her timber company . demand for a ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal logging damages the rainforest to prevent forestal venao from wreaking further havoc on brazilian territory , benki and moises piyako demand a world-wide ban on imports of wood illegally felled in rainforests . " there are only a few specimen left of many of the tree species , and we are trying to recultivate these economic plants , " they said , adding that there is a lack of understanding for the importance of managing resources sustainably . " we must make sure that our natural resources are not destroyed in the struggle for survival . " in their fight for environmental protection , the ashaninka combine traditional knowledge and modern technology .

the basque separatist group eta is believed to have been behind the attacks . spanish police officials said they were trying to determine the identities of the people behind the bomb blasts . the attacks are believed to have been carried out by the basque separatist group eta .
only a few clues had emerged on monday and authorities could not say whether the bombers were still on the island or if there was an eta terrorist cell on the island itself . it is also unclear whether sunday 's bombers were the same people responsible for a bomb attack that killed two policemen in july . spain 's king juan carlos has condemned the mallorca bombings saying the attacks would not succeed in damaging spain 's democracy . there is speculation that the attacks may have been meant to draw attention to eta ’ s cause rather than to harm people because all of the bombs contained low levels of explosives and were detonated after warnings had been given , giving the authorities time to clear people from the blast sites .
no injuries were reported . the first of sunday 's bombings occurred at a restaurant on the outskirts of palma de mallorca , near a recreational harbor along the road leading from the city center to the island 's airport .
the explosive was hidden in a backpack in one of the restaurant 's bathrooms . the second explosion came about two hours later in another restaurant about 500 meters -lrb- 546 yards -rrb- from the first .
the third came in a nearby underground supermarket shortly afterwards .
the shopping complex had already been sealed off by police . the origin of a fourth explosion - in a restaurant - was being investigated to find out whether it was a gas explosion or another bomb blast .
overnight police were searching for yet another suspected bomb in a hotel complex in palma de mallorca . bombings followed eta claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first two bombs exploded in restaurants while the third went off in a supermarket the attacks are another blow to the island 's tourism industry and came only hours after eta admitted it was behind bombings that claimed the lives of two civil guard officers and a police inspector and injured dozens more in june and july . the group did not initially claim responsibility for an attack in the mallorcan resort town of palmanova on july 30 , but confirmed in a statement in the basque newspaper , gara , on sunday that it had been behind the car bombing . the explosion killed two civil guard officers who had been driving the vehicle at the time . eta also said it was behind a car bombing in the basque city of bilbao in june which claimed the life of police inspector eduardo puelles garcia . the separatists said garcia had been " the chief of police operations against numerous leftist independence activists and against pro-independence youths for the past decades , and the coordinator of different operations against eta . " eta also said it was behind two other attacks , both in july .
one was a car bombing outside of a police barracks , which injured more than 40 people ; the other an attack on the governing socialist party 's offices in the basque town of durango . ai / mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the indigenous communities are using both ancient knowledge and modern technology to protect biodiversity and stop further destruction . the lush green of the rain forest offers rich natural resources which the ashaninka indians have lived on for centuries .
at the yoreka atame school of primeval forestry in brazil , young indigenous and non-indigenous people have been learning how to make use of them in a sustainable way . since 2007 , the school has taught more than 2,000 participants skills like the cultivating fruit trees , keeping bees , and erecting dams in creeks and lakes to enhance spawning grounds for fish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cultivating traditional plants is part of the curriculum " that 's how we ashaninka indians here in the border region between brazil and peru want to pass on our traditional knowledge , " said moises piyako .
he cofounded the yoreka atame school together with his brother benki in 2007 . illegal logging threatens biodiversity political problems between brazil and its neighbor peru make life complicated for the indigenous people in the border region . " we are suffering from peruvian logging companies , and now the peruvian government also wants to dig for oil along the border , " said moises piyako . illegal timber-fellers from peru are increasingly encroaching on the rainforest on both sides of the border . the land and its resources belong to the ashaninka , according to the indigenous and tribal peoples convention 169 adopted by the international labour organisation , ilo .
it recognizes the rights of ownership of the peoples over the lands which they traditionally occupy .
but peru has been trying to circumnavigate international law by granting mining concessions for areas that are owned by indigenous peoples . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ashaninka live in the border region between brazil and peru " in the process , peruvian timber companies even illegally enter brazilian territory , " said ashaninka spokesman benki piyako .
" illegal logging is putting our whole region and its biodiversity at risk . " the invasion of ashaninka rainforests by illegal loggers started in 2001 with a company called forestal venao , which is owned by the daughter of the former peruvian president , alberto fujimori .
he was recently put on trial for corruption and has already been convicted to 25 years in prison for severe human rights violations and killing opposition politicians . his daughter , keiko fujimori , has announced her candidacy for the presidency as well as her aim to officially pardon her father should she come to power .
her political campaign is partially funded by the earnings from her timber company . demand for a ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal logging damages the rainforest to prevent forestal venao from wreaking further havoc on brazilian territory , benki and moises piyako demand a world-wide ban on imports of wood illegally felled in rainforests . " there are only a few specimen left of many of the tree species , and we are trying to recultivate these economic plants , " they said , adding that there is a lack of understanding for the importance of managing resources sustainably . " we must make sure that our natural resources are not destroyed in the struggle for survival . " in their fight for environmental protection , the ashaninka combine traditional knowledge and modern technology .
some remote communities have already set up satellite-supported communication systems in the rainforest .
by checking satellite photographs on a computer , the communities can monitor illegal logging activities or the illegal construction of roads in their region . " we install this monitoring system , and we teach the local people how to operate the gps technology , " said benki piyako . hi-tech to protect the rainforest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 certificates pay for recultivation efforts in addition , benki piyako and his village of apiwtxa have set up a video blog on life in the rainforest .
there , they also post satellite photos that document how illegal logging is devastating huge areas .
it is their aim to teach people how the forest and its resources can be used without destroying them .
and they also want to set up a global network supporting the protection of their region . modern tools are also employed when it comes to environmental protection . the indigenous organization in apiwtxa sells co2 certificates , and the ashaninka also offer them to companies that want to support the protection of the rainforest .

however environmentalists warn that previous climate commitments are way off the mark . delegations from 192 countries are meeting in bonn to continue negotiations towards a global climate deal , which is to be finalised at a much-anticipated un meeting in copenhagen in december .
at the recent g-8 summit in the earthquake-devastated italian town of l 'aquila , developed nations , including the us , promised to limit global warming to two degrees celsius by 2050 .
however , climate experts and environmental groups say even two degrees is far too high and would have cataclysmic consequences .
martin kaiser , who is representing the environmental group greenpeace at the un climate talks , says an increase of two degrees would probably result in the disappearance of the amazon rainforest .
" -lrb- two degrees -rrb- would mean that sea levels would rise by one meter , and it would also mean that much arable land would become so dry that it would no longer be cultivable , " he says .

this third round of talks is intended as an ' informal meeting ' and is being held in bonn , as were the first two rounds . two further conferences are to be held in bangkok in september and october , and then in barcelona at the beginning of november .
the result of the last conference in bonn was a 300-page document with suggestions from the 192 negotiating countries .
the aim of this week 's meeting is to reduce the document to between 50 and 100 pages ; this will then form the basis of discussions in copenhagen .

disputes continue about who should do what and in what time frame .
there are also questions about who should provide financing for developing nations so that they can also combat the effects of climate change .
yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change , recently told the french news agency afp that the kyoto-replacement climate treaty would be crippled without strong commitments from developed nations and would " defeat the whole purpose of the copenhagen agreement . "
developed nations have been reluctant to agree to concrete commitments without the support of developing nations , especially china and india , two of the world 's fastest growing countries with the world 's two largest populations .
however , china and india say that their commitments should not be equal to those of wealthy countries because their populations are poorer and because they say their nations ' growth would be stilted by restrictions .

however environmentalists warn that previous climate commitments are way off the mark . delegations from 192 countries are meeting in bonn to continue negotiations towards a global climate deal , which is to be finalised at a much-anticipated un meeting in copenhagen in december .
at the recent g-8 summit in the earthquake-devastated italian town of l 'aquila , developed nations , including the us , promised to limit global warming to two degrees celsius by 2050 .
however , climate experts and environmental groups say even two degrees is far too high and would have cataclysmic consequences .
martin kaiser , who is representing the environmental group greenpeace at the un climate talks , says an increase of two degrees would probably result in the disappearance of the amazon rainforest .
" -lrb- two degrees -rrb- would mean that sea levels would rise by one meter , and it would also mean that much arable land would become so dry that it would no longer be cultivable , " he says .
a replacement for kyoto in total , five rounds of preliminary talks will have been held by the time the copenhagen meeting roles around in december .
this third round of talks is intended as an ' informal meeting ' and is being held in bonn , as were the first two rounds . two further conferences are to be held in bangkok in september and october , and then in barcelona at the beginning of november .
the result of the last conference in bonn was a 300-page document with suggestions from the 192 negotiating countries .
the aim of this week 's meeting is to reduce the document to between 50 and 100 pages ; this will then form the basis of discussions in copenhagen .
suggestions abound ; commitments are scarce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests accompanied the last un climate talks in bonn despite the hundreds of pages of suggestions , solid commitments from un member nations have not been forthcoming .
disputes continue about who should do what and in what time frame .
there are also questions about who should provide financing for developing nations so that they can also combat the effects of climate change .
yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change , recently told the french news agency afp that the kyoto-replacement climate treaty would be crippled without strong commitments from developed nations and would " defeat the whole purpose of the copenhagen agreement . "
developed nations have been reluctant to agree to concrete commitments without the support of developing nations , especially china and india , two of the world 's fastest growing countries with the world 's two largest populations .
however , china and india say that their commitments should not be equal to those of wealthy countries because their populations are poorer and because they say their nations ' growth would be stilted by restrictions .

the confessions are expected to shorten the trial of the four men . in his wide-ranging confession , suspected ring leader fritz gelowicz told the court how the group 's plans for a terror attack in germany developed .
according to his confession in a duesseldorf court , the alleged mastermind of the group took part in a three-month terrorist training camp in pakistan in 2006 .
there , a plot was hatched to attack american targets , particularly military personnel , in germany .
part of the training dealt with weapons , such as kalashnikov machine guns , and the suspects were also reportedly trained in explosives and circuitry for bomb making .
prosecution lawyer volker brinkmann said ahead of the trial that the suspects had admitted to their goal of " killing as many americans as possible . "
unprecedented confessions the members of the so-called sauerland terror cell have been questioned by police for the past four weeks since the court adjourned for its summer recess .
their written testimonies now run to over 1,500 pages .
the confessions are more extensive than expected and they are likely to speed up the trial and reduce the sentences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presiding judge ottmar breidling called the wide-ranging confessions " impressive " chief judge ottmar breidling said the questioning during the four-week break had revealed an unexpectedly " impressive " range of information .
international security expert michael lueders says the confessions could significantly reduce the length of the trial .
" in the beginning , there was talk of two years for this process , but now people talk about three or four months , " lueders told deutsche welle .
this is one of the biggest terrorism trials in germany since those involving the urban guerrillas of the red army faction in the 1970s .
suspects accused of planning massive attacks the men allegedly formed their terror cell for the islamic jihad union and stand accused of plotting at least three bomb attacks in german cities targeting us citizens .
authorities say the group aimed to carry out attacks as deadly as those of september 11 , 2001 which killed around 3,000 people in the united states .
two of the suspects , gelowicz and daniel schneider , aged 29 and 23 respectively , are german converts to islam .
a third suspect , attila selek , is a 24-year-old german citizen of turkish origin , while 30-year-old adem yilmaz is a turkish national .
the threat of ' home grown ' terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the suspects were arrested in september 2007 with hydrogen peroxide drums the sauerland cell is named after a western german region where three of the men were apprehended in september 2007 along with 26 detonators and 12 drums of hydrogen peroxide , a substance used in the deadly attacks on london 's transport system two years earlier .
selek was later caught in turkey .
although the men were apprehended before any attacks took place , the fact that such ' home grown ' terrorists may pose a real threat in germany is a major cause for concern , says international security expert michael lueders .
" not everyone who converts to islam is radical , but some people are , and this is really a room for concern for most security analysts in germany , " said lueders , " and nobody really knows how to solve this issue .
so these so-called converts are really targeted by police . "

but the indigenous communities are using both ancient knowledge and modern technology to protect biodiversity and stop further destruction . the lush green of the rain forest offers rich natural resources which the ashaninka indians have lived on for centuries .
at the yoreka atame school of primeval forestry in brazil , young indigenous and non-indigenous people have been learning how to make use of them in a sustainable way . since 2007 , the school has taught more than 2,000 participants skills like the cultivating fruit trees , keeping bees , and erecting dams in creeks and lakes to enhance spawning grounds for fish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cultivating traditional plants is part of the curriculum " that 's how we ashaninka indians here in the border region between brazil and peru want to pass on our traditional knowledge , " said moises piyako .
he cofounded the yoreka atame school together with his brother benki in 2007 . illegal logging threatens biodiversity political problems between brazil and its neighbor peru make life complicated for the indigenous people in the border region . " we are suffering from peruvian logging companies , and now the peruvian government also wants to dig for oil along the border , " said moises piyako . illegal timber-fellers from peru are increasingly encroaching on the rainforest on both sides of the border . the land and its resources belong to the ashaninka , according to the indigenous and tribal peoples convention 169 adopted by the international labour organisation , ilo .
it recognizes the rights of ownership of the peoples over the lands which they traditionally occupy .
but peru has been trying to circumnavigate international law by granting mining concessions for areas that are owned by indigenous peoples . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ashaninka live in the border region between brazil and peru " in the process , peruvian timber companies even illegally enter brazilian territory , " said ashaninka spokesman benki piyako .
" illegal logging is putting our whole region and its biodiversity at risk . " the invasion of ashaninka rainforests by illegal loggers started in 2001 with a company called forestal venao , which is owned by the daughter of the former peruvian president , alberto fujimori .
he was recently put on trial for corruption and has already been convicted to 25 years in prison for severe human rights violations and killing opposition politicians . his daughter , keiko fujimori , has announced her candidacy for the presidency as well as her aim to officially pardon her father should she come to power .
her political campaign is partially funded by the earnings from her timber company . demand for a ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal logging damages the rainforest to prevent forestal venao from wreaking further havoc on brazilian territory , benki and moises piyako demand a world-wide ban on imports of wood illegally felled in rainforests . " there are only a few specimen left of many of the tree species , and we are trying to recultivate these economic plants , " they said , adding that there is a lack of understanding for the importance of managing resources sustainably . " we must make sure that our natural resources are not destroyed in the struggle for survival . " in their fight for environmental protection , the ashaninka combine traditional knowledge and modern technology .
some remote communities have already set up satellite-supported communication systems in the rainforest .
by checking satellite photographs on a computer , the communities can monitor illegal logging activities or the illegal construction of roads in their region . " we install this monitoring system , and we teach the local people how to operate the gps technology , " said benki piyako . hi-tech to protect the rainforest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 certificates pay for recultivation efforts in addition , benki piyako and his village of apiwtxa have set up a video blog on life in the rainforest .
there , they also post satellite photos that document how illegal logging is devastating huge areas .
it is their aim to teach people how the forest and its resources can be used without destroying them .
and they also want to set up a global network supporting the protection of their region . modern tools are also employed when it comes to environmental protection . the indigenous organization in apiwtxa sells co2 certificates , and the ashaninka also offer them to companies that want to support the protection of the rainforest .

but the indigenous communities are using both ancient knowledge and modern technology to protect biodiversity and stop further destruction . the lush green of the rain forest offers rich natural resources which the ashaninka indians have lived on for centuries .
at the yoreka atame school of primeval forestry in brazil , young indigenous and non-indigenous people have been learning how to make use of them in a sustainable way . since 2007 , the school has taught more than 2,000 participants skills like the cultivating fruit trees , keeping bees , and erecting dams in creeks and lakes to enhance spawning grounds for fish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cultivating traditional plants is part of the curriculum " that 's how we ashaninka indians here in the border region between brazil and peru want to pass on our traditional knowledge , " said moises piyako .
he cofounded the yoreka atame school together with his brother benki in 2007 . illegal logging threatens biodiversity political problems between brazil and its neighbor peru make life complicated for the indigenous people in the border region . " we are suffering from peruvian logging companies , and now the peruvian government also wants to dig for oil along the border , " said moises piyako . illegal timber-fellers from peru are increasingly encroaching on the rainforest on both sides of the border . the land and its resources belong to the ashaninka , according to the indigenous and tribal peoples convention 169 adopted by the international labour organisation , ilo .
it recognizes the rights of ownership of the peoples over the lands which they traditionally occupy .
but peru has been trying to circumnavigate international law by granting mining concessions for areas that are owned by indigenous peoples . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ashaninka live in the border region between brazil and peru " in the process , peruvian timber companies even illegally enter brazilian territory , " said ashaninka spokesman benki piyako .
" illegal logging is putting our whole region and its biodiversity at risk . " the invasion of ashaninka rainforests by illegal loggers started in 2001 with a company called forestal venao , which is owned by the daughter of the former peruvian president , alberto fujimori .
he was recently put on trial for corruption and has already been convicted to 25 years in prison for severe human rights violations and killing opposition politicians . his daughter , keiko fujimori , has announced her candidacy for the presidency as well as her aim to officially pardon her father should she come to power .
her political campaign is partially funded by the earnings from her timber company . demand for a ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal logging damages the rainforest to prevent forestal venao from wreaking further havoc on brazilian territory , benki and moises piyako demand a world-wide ban on imports of wood illegally felled in rainforests . " there are only a few specimen left of many of the tree species , and we are trying to recultivate these economic plants , " they said , adding that there is a lack of understanding for the importance of managing resources sustainably . " we must make sure that our natural resources are not destroyed in the struggle for survival . " in their fight for environmental protection , the ashaninka combine traditional knowledge and modern technology .
some remote communities have already set up satellite-supported communication systems in the rainforest .
by checking satellite photographs on a computer , the communities can monitor illegal logging activities or the illegal construction of roads in their region . " we install this monitoring system , and we teach the local people how to operate the gps technology , " said benki piyako . hi-tech to protect the rainforest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 certificates pay for recultivation efforts in addition , benki piyako and his village of apiwtxa have set up a video blog on life in the rainforest .
there , they also post satellite photos that document how illegal logging is devastating huge areas .
it is their aim to teach people how the forest and its resources can be used without destroying them .
and they also want to set up a global network supporting the protection of their region . modern tools are also employed when it comes to environmental protection . the indigenous organization in apiwtxa sells co2 certificates , and the ashaninka also offer them to companies that want to support the protection of the rainforest .

however environmentalists warn that previous climate commitments are way off the mark . delegations from 192 countries are meeting in bonn to continue negotiations towards a global climate deal , which is to be finalised at a much-anticipated un meeting in copenhagen in december .
at the recent g-8 summit in the earthquake-devastated italian town of l 'aquila , developed nations , including the us , promised to limit global warming to two degrees celsius by 2050 .
however , climate experts and environmental groups say even two degrees is far too high and would have cataclysmic consequences .
martin kaiser , who is representing the environmental group greenpeace at the un climate talks , says an increase of two degrees would probably result in the disappearance of the amazon rainforest .
" -lrb- two degrees -rrb- would mean that sea levels would rise by one meter , and it would also mean that much arable land would become so dry that it would no longer be cultivable , " he says .
a replacement for kyoto in total , five rounds of preliminary talks will have been held by the time the copenhagen meeting roles around in december .
this third round of talks is intended as an ' informal meeting ' and is being held in bonn , as were the first two rounds . two further conferences are to be held in bangkok in september and october , and then in barcelona at the beginning of november .
the result of the last conference in bonn was a 300-page document with suggestions from the 192 negotiating countries .
the aim of this week 's meeting is to reduce the document to between 50 and 100 pages ; this will then form the basis of discussions in copenhagen .
suggestions abound ; commitments are scarce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests accompanied the last un climate talks in bonn despite the hundreds of pages of suggestions , solid commitments from un member nations have not been forthcoming .
disputes continue about who should do what and in what time frame .
there are also questions about who should provide financing for developing nations so that they can also combat the effects of climate change .
yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change , recently told the french news agency afp that the kyoto-replacement climate treaty would be crippled without strong commitments from developed nations and would " defeat the whole purpose of the copenhagen agreement . "
developed nations have been reluctant to agree to concrete commitments without the support of developing nations , especially china and india , two of the world 's fastest growing countries with the world 's two largest populations .
however , china and india say that their commitments should not be equal to those of wealthy countries because their populations are poorer and because they say their nations ' growth would be stilted by restrictions .

the basque separatist group eta is believed to have been behind the attacks . spanish police officials said they were trying to determine the identities of the people behind the bomb blasts . the attacks are believed to have been carried out by the basque separatist group eta .
only a few clues had emerged on monday and authorities could not say whether the bombers were still on the island or if there was an eta terrorist cell on the island itself . it is also unclear whether sunday 's bombers were the same people responsible for a bomb attack that killed two policemen in july . spain 's king juan carlos has condemned the mallorca bombings saying the attacks would not succeed in damaging spain 's democracy . there is speculation that the attacks may have been meant to draw attention to eta ’ s cause rather than to harm people because all of the bombs contained low levels of explosives and were detonated after warnings had been given , giving the authorities time to clear people from the blast sites .
no injuries were reported . the first of sunday 's bombings occurred at a restaurant on the outskirts of palma de mallorca , near a recreational harbor along the road leading from the city center to the island 's airport .
the explosive was hidden in a backpack in one of the restaurant 's bathrooms . the second explosion came about two hours later in another restaurant about 500 meters -lrb- 546 yards -rrb- from the first .
the third came in a nearby underground supermarket shortly afterwards .
the shopping complex had already been sealed off by police . the origin of a fourth explosion - in a restaurant - was being investigated to find out whether it was a gas explosion or another bomb blast .
overnight police were searching for yet another suspected bomb in a hotel complex in palma de mallorca . bombings followed eta claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first two bombs exploded in restaurants while the third went off in a supermarket the attacks are another blow to the island 's tourism industry and came only hours after eta admitted it was behind bombings that claimed the lives of two civil guard officers and a police inspector and injured dozens more in june and july . the group did not initially claim responsibility for an attack in the mallorcan resort town of palmanova on july 30 , but confirmed in a statement in the basque newspaper , gara , on sunday that it had been behind the car bombing . the explosion killed two civil guard officers who had been driving the vehicle at the time . eta also said it was behind a car bombing in the basque city of bilbao in june which claimed the life of police inspector eduardo puelles garcia . the separatists said garcia had been " the chief of police operations against numerous leftist independence activists and against pro-independence youths for the past decades , and the coordinator of different operations against eta . " eta also said it was behind two other attacks , both in july .
one was a car bombing outside of a police barracks , which injured more than 40 people ; the other an attack on the governing socialist party 's offices in the basque town of durango . ai / mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 10.08.2009 suspected leader of sauerland terror cell confesses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz gelowicz , the alleged mastermind behind the sauerland cell , confessed to planning terror attacks in germany the first of four alleged islamist militants known as the sauerland cell took the stand to confess his role in planning terror attacks in germany .
the confessions are expected to shorten the trial of the four men . in his wide-ranging confession , suspected ring leader fritz gelowicz told the court how the group 's plans for a terror attack in germany developed .
according to his confession in a duesseldorf court , the alleged mastermind of the group took part in a three-month terrorist training camp in pakistan in 2006 .
there , a plot was hatched to attack american targets , particularly military personnel , in germany .
part of the training dealt with weapons , such as kalashnikov machine guns , and the suspects were also reportedly trained in explosives and circuitry for bomb making .
prosecution lawyer volker brinkmann said ahead of the trial that the suspects had admitted to their goal of " killing as many americans as possible . "
unprecedented confessions the members of the so-called sauerland terror cell have been questioned by police for the past four weeks since the court adjourned for its summer recess .
their written testimonies now run to over 1,500 pages .
the confessions are more extensive than expected and they are likely to speed up the trial and reduce the sentences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presiding judge ottmar breidling called the wide-ranging confessions " impressive " chief judge ottmar breidling said the questioning during the four-week break had revealed an unexpectedly " impressive " range of information .
international security expert michael lueders says the confessions could significantly reduce the length of the trial .
" in the beginning , there was talk of two years for this process , but now people talk about three or four months , " lueders told deutsche welle .
this is one of the biggest terrorism trials in germany since those involving the urban guerrillas of the red army faction in the 1970s .
suspects accused of planning massive attacks the men allegedly formed their terror cell for the islamic jihad union and stand accused of plotting at least three bomb attacks in german cities targeting us citizens .
authorities say the group aimed to carry out attacks as deadly as those of september 11 , 2001 which killed around 3,000 people in the united states .
two of the suspects , gelowicz and daniel schneider , aged 29 and 23 respectively , are german converts to islam .
a third suspect , attila selek , is a 24-year-old german citizen of turkish origin , while 30-year-old adem yilmaz is a turkish national .
the threat of ' home grown ' terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the suspects were arrested in september 2007 with hydrogen peroxide drums the sauerland cell is named after a western german region where three of the men were apprehended in september 2007 along with 26 detonators and 12 drums of hydrogen peroxide , a substance used in the deadly attacks on london 's transport system two years earlier .
selek was later caught in turkey .
although the men were apprehended before any attacks took place , the fact that such ' home grown ' terrorists may pose a real threat in germany is a major cause for concern , says international security expert michael lueders .
" not everyone who converts to islam is radical , but some people are , and this is really a room for concern for most security analysts in germany , " said lueders , " and nobody really knows how to solve this issue .
so these so-called converts are really targeted by police . "
if convicted , the suspected terrorists could face up to 15 years in prison. mz / dpa / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the confessions are expected to shorten the trial of the four men . in his wide-ranging confession , suspected ring leader fritz gelowicz told the court how the group 's plans for a terror attack in germany developed .
according to his confession in a duesseldorf court , the alleged mastermind of the group took part in a three-month terrorist training camp in pakistan in 2006 .
there , a plot was hatched to attack american targets , particularly military personnel , in germany .
part of the training dealt with weapons , such as kalashnikov machine guns , and the suspects were also reportedly trained in explosives and circuitry for bomb making .
prosecution lawyer volker brinkmann said ahead of the trial that the suspects had admitted to their goal of " killing as many americans as possible . "
unprecedented confessions the members of the so-called sauerland terror cell have been questioned by police for the past four weeks since the court adjourned for its summer recess .
their written testimonies now run to over 1,500 pages .
the confessions are more extensive than expected and they are likely to speed up the trial and reduce the sentences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presiding judge ottmar breidling called the wide-ranging confessions " impressive " chief judge ottmar breidling said the questioning during the four-week break had revealed an unexpectedly " impressive " range of information .
international security expert michael lueders says the confessions could significantly reduce the length of the trial .
" in the beginning , there was talk of two years for this process , but now people talk about three or four months , " lueders told deutsche welle .
this is one of the biggest terrorism trials in germany since those involving the urban guerrillas of the red army faction in the 1970s .
suspects accused of planning massive attacks the men allegedly formed their terror cell for the islamic jihad union and stand accused of plotting at least three bomb attacks in german cities targeting us citizens .
authorities say the group aimed to carry out attacks as deadly as those of september 11 , 2001 which killed around 3,000 people in the united states .
two of the suspects , gelowicz and daniel schneider , aged 29 and 23 respectively , are german converts to islam .
a third suspect , attila selek , is a 24-year-old german citizen of turkish origin , while 30-year-old adem yilmaz is a turkish national .
the threat of ' home grown ' terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the suspects were arrested in september 2007 with hydrogen peroxide drums the sauerland cell is named after a western german region where three of the men were apprehended in september 2007 along with 26 detonators and 12 drums of hydrogen peroxide , a substance used in the deadly attacks on london 's transport system two years earlier .
selek was later caught in turkey .
although the men were apprehended before any attacks took place , the fact that such ' home grown ' terrorists may pose a real threat in germany is a major cause for concern , says international security expert michael lueders .
" not everyone who converts to islam is radical , but some people are , and this is really a room for concern for most security analysts in germany , " said lueders , " and nobody really knows how to solve this issue .
so these so-called converts are really targeted by police . "
if convicted , the suspected terrorists could face up to 15 years in prison. mz / dpa / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "

one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .

cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

every genre has a connection to all the others and percussion is at home in all these areas . was exactly is the connection between jazz and contemporary music ? contemporary music has a lot to do with percussion because the composers today use a lot of different percussion instruments in their works .

without percussion , the music would n't work - without the rhythm and the stringency . can you describe the different challenges that jazz and contemporary music involve ? yes , of course these different types of music have to be approached differently .
with jazz , you are creative and you can do a lot - every evening is different .
in contemporary music , it 's important to the composers that you stay true to the score and actually play what 's written .
that 's crucial because the composers have something particular in mind . if i were to improvise a work by iannis xenakis , for example , it would be a scandal , a falsification .
it would totally miss the composer 's idea .
xenakis mathematically calculates the relationship between the instruments .
that means if you do n't play exactly what 's in the score , the result would be total chaos . with jazz , it 's completely different .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 10.08.2009 percussionists are natural all-rounders , says young star grubinger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grubinger was born in salzburg in 1983 and is playing at this year 's festival there at just 26 , austrian percussionist martin grubinger 's concerts sell out around the world .
praised for his musical versatility , he told dw how all musical genres are linked - and what he 's going to do when he retires . martin grubinger has performed in some of the world 's top concert halls , including the koelner philharmonie , the concertgebouw in amsterdam and carnegie hall in new york .
he is currently active in the european summer music festival scene , playing at the salzburg festival in austria and at germany 's schleswig-holstein music festival , where he is an artist in residence . deutsche welle : you 're at home in practically every musical genre .
how did you become such a versatile musician ? martin grubinger : for us percussionists , there 's a logical connection between contemporary music and jazz .
or take salsa , samba , tango , funk , fusion , rock - all of these belong together for us percussionists .
every genre has a connection to all the others and percussion is at home in all these areas . was exactly is the connection between jazz and contemporary music ? contemporary music has a lot to do with percussion because the composers today use a lot of different percussion instruments in their works .
they 're discovering the instrument , both in solo and orchestral contexts - there 's always quite a lot of percussion in contemporary compositions .
without percussion , the music would n't work - without the rhythm and the stringency . can you describe the different challenges that jazz and contemporary music involve ? yes , of course these different types of music have to be approached differently .
with jazz , you are creative and you can do a lot - every evening is different .
in contemporary music , it 's important to the composers that you stay true to the score and actually play what 's written .
that 's crucial because the composers have something particular in mind . if i were to improvise a work by iannis xenakis , for example , it would be a scandal , a falsification .
it would totally miss the composer 's idea .
xenakis mathematically calculates the relationship between the instruments .
that means if you do n't play exactly what 's in the score , the result would be total chaos . with jazz , it 's completely different .
there , you just have to stay within the meter and the harmonies and otherwise you 're pretty much free . bildunterschrift : without percussion , contemporary music would n't work , says grubinger this year , you 're an artist in residence at the schleswig-holstein music festival , where you 've given a wide variety of workshops and concerts and with diverse programs .
all of your concerts were sold out , which earned you the label " audience magnet . " yes , it 's actually really funny .
for us musicians , things happen via friendships and connections .
you hear people when you 're on tour - you sit in concerts and think , he has to play with my ensemble , i want to work with him ! in our case , we 're in a position to bring a big audience into the concert hall , so of course the good musicians want to play with us .
that 's a big advantage , because that way we can gain a lot of quality and expertise in very different areas . the other musicians who work with you have said they really enjoy it .
is there a reciprocal effect with the members of your ensemble ? it 's unbelievable what you can learn on such an evening , you 're sensitized to entirely new things .
as a percussionist , you work in one direction , then there 's a violinist who has a completely different idea of how things should sound and a much bigger palette of colors .
he has a different idea of phrasing and rhythm , and an entirely different perspective on music .
it 's important , then , to learn to say , i want to watch out for those things too . you once said you work with a sports medicine specialist to be able to perform at 100 percent capacity even when your pulse is running at an average of 160 beats per minute during a concert .
you always perform from memory - do you ever have time to relax ? i 'm passionate about cycling and can relax really well when i 'm doing that , or when i 'm playing or watching soccer .
i like to read about socio-political things and i love history .
when i stop playing percussion , i want to study history . interview : magdalene melchers -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three bomb blasts on mallorca are the latest attacks on the popular tourist destination .
while all signs point to the involvement of eta , authorities have not officially named the group over sunday 's bombings . to learn more about the eta and their strategies , deutsche welle interviewed professor paul heywood , an expert on the basque separatist group at the university of nottingham in the united kingdom .
dw : the authorities have yet to conclusively link eta to sunday 's three bomb blasts .
is there any doubt about their involvement ? paul heywood : it is almost certain this was the work of eta , they had released statements the day before about a series of previous attacks that had taken place in june and july and these latest attacks follow a very similar pattern , including two attacks on holiday resorts in the past .
from your knowledge of the way eta operates , would they have had an active cell on the island , or would they have sent in people from the mainland ?
they probably sent people in from the mainland .
now there was , of course , the assassination of two civil guards on the island in palmanova on 30th july and these bombs that went off yesterday -lrb- sunday ed . -rrb- were all on timer devices , so it is just possible that the cell which carried out the assassinations just over a week ago also planted the bombs , though it 's a long time for bombs to be on timer devices , it 's more likely that they 've still got some people on the island .
how successful have the spanish authorities been in the past in tracking down eta bombers ?
well there have been a lot of high profile arrests of eta leaders and there 's been in recent years much more effective collaboration with the french authorities , so that the french and the spanish police have worked together to capture some of the top eta leaders .
however one of the issues - it can hardly be overstressed with any organization like eta - is that they are not single organizations where there is one leadership and if you capture that leadership then the organization is undermined .
these organizations operate on the basis of numbers of different cells which operate according to different command structures within different parts of the country , and indeed , they are often characterized by splits within the organization , so eta , just like a lot of other terrorist organizations , has historically had splits between an official leadership - quite often wanting dialogue and political interaction with the government - and more militant , often younger members , who are against dialogue and want to continue the campaign of violence .
what is likely to be the impact on spain 's tourism industry ? that 's what they are aiming for - to hurt spain 's tourism industry - this is a form of economic terrorism .
the targets are not members of the public , still less actual tourists .
eta has a history of mainly targeting members of the spanish armed forces or police and recent assassinations which have taken place have been of members of the civil guard .
eta has never really gone for soft targets in the sense of members of the public or holidaymakers , tourists .
but what they do want to do to is to instil a sense of fear so that people think twice about whether they are going to visit spain on holiday and in that sense create an economic climate for the government , which of course is already struggling with the impact of recession , which makes it much more difficult for them .

three bomb blasts on mallorca are the latest attacks on the popular tourist destination .
while all signs point to the involvement of eta , authorities have not officially named the group over sunday 's bombings . to learn more about the eta and their strategies , deutsche welle interviewed professor paul heywood , an expert on the basque separatist group at the university of nottingham in the united kingdom .
dw : the authorities have yet to conclusively link eta to sunday 's three bomb blasts .
is there any doubt about their involvement ? paul heywood : it is almost certain this was the work of eta , they had released statements the day before about a series of previous attacks that had taken place in june and july and these latest attacks follow a very similar pattern , including two attacks on holiday resorts in the past .
from your knowledge of the way eta operates , would they have had an active cell on the island , or would they have sent in people from the mainland ?
they probably sent people in from the mainland .
now there was , of course , the assassination of two civil guards on the island in palmanova on 30th july and these bombs that went off yesterday -lrb- sunday ed . -rrb- were all on timer devices , so it is just possible that the cell which carried out the assassinations just over a week ago also planted the bombs , though it 's a long time for bombs to be on timer devices , it 's more likely that they 've still got some people on the island .
how successful have the spanish authorities been in the past in tracking down eta bombers ?
well there have been a lot of high profile arrests of eta leaders and there 's been in recent years much more effective collaboration with the french authorities , so that the french and the spanish police have worked together to capture some of the top eta leaders .
however one of the issues - it can hardly be overstressed with any organization like eta - is that they are not single organizations where there is one leadership and if you capture that leadership then the organization is undermined .
these organizations operate on the basis of numbers of different cells which operate according to different command structures within different parts of the country , and indeed , they are often characterized by splits within the organization , so eta , just like a lot of other terrorist organizations , has historically had splits between an official leadership - quite often wanting dialogue and political interaction with the government - and more militant , often younger members , who are against dialogue and want to continue the campaign of violence .
what is likely to be the impact on spain 's tourism industry ? that 's what they are aiming for - to hurt spain 's tourism industry - this is a form of economic terrorism .
the targets are not members of the public , still less actual tourists .
eta has a history of mainly targeting members of the spanish armed forces or police and recent assassinations which have taken place have been of members of the civil guard .
eta has never really gone for soft targets in the sense of members of the public or holidaymakers , tourists .
but what they do want to do to is to instil a sense of fear so that people think twice about whether they are going to visit spain on holiday and in that sense create an economic climate for the government , which of course is already struggling with the impact of recession , which makes it much more difficult for them .

praised for his musical versatility , he told dw how all musical genres are linked - and what he 's going to do when he retires . martin grubinger has performed in some of the world 's top concert halls , including the koelner philharmonie , the concertgebouw in amsterdam and carnegie hall in new york .
he is currently active in the european summer music festival scene , playing at the salzburg festival in austria and at germany 's schleswig-holstein music festival , where he is an artist in residence . deutsche welle : you 're at home in practically every musical genre .
how did you become such a versatile musician ? martin grubinger : for us percussionists , there 's a logical connection between contemporary music and jazz .
or take salsa , samba , tango , funk , fusion , rock - all of these belong together for us percussionists .
every genre has a connection to all the others and percussion is at home in all these areas . was exactly is the connection between jazz and contemporary music ? contemporary music has a lot to do with percussion because the composers today use a lot of different percussion instruments in their works .
they 're discovering the instrument , both in solo and orchestral contexts - there 's always quite a lot of percussion in contemporary compositions .
without percussion , the music would n't work - without the rhythm and the stringency . can you describe the different challenges that jazz and contemporary music involve ? yes , of course these different types of music have to be approached differently .
with jazz , you are creative and you can do a lot - every evening is different .
in contemporary music , it 's important to the composers that you stay true to the score and actually play what 's written .
that 's crucial because the composers have something particular in mind . if i were to improvise a work by iannis xenakis , for example , it would be a scandal , a falsification .
it would totally miss the composer 's idea .
xenakis mathematically calculates the relationship between the instruments .
that means if you do n't play exactly what 's in the score , the result would be total chaos . with jazz , it 's completely different .
there , you just have to stay within the meter and the harmonies and otherwise you 're pretty much free . bildunterschrift : without percussion , contemporary music would n't work , says grubinger this year , you 're an artist in residence at the schleswig-holstein music festival , where you 've given a wide variety of workshops and concerts and with diverse programs .
all of your concerts were sold out , which earned you the label " audience magnet . " yes , it 's actually really funny .
for us musicians , things happen via friendships and connections .
you hear people when you 're on tour - you sit in concerts and think , he has to play with my ensemble , i want to work with him ! in our case , we 're in a position to bring a big audience into the concert hall , so of course the good musicians want to play with us .
that 's a big advantage , because that way we can gain a lot of quality and expertise in very different areas . the other musicians who work with you have said they really enjoy it .
is there a reciprocal effect with the members of your ensemble ? it 's unbelievable what you can learn on such an evening , you 're sensitized to entirely new things .
as a percussionist , you work in one direction , then there 's a violinist who has a completely different idea of how things should sound and a much bigger palette of colors .
he has a different idea of phrasing and rhythm , and an entirely different perspective on music .
it 's important , then , to learn to say , i want to watch out for those things too . you once said you work with a sports medicine specialist to be able to perform at 100 percent capacity even when your pulse is running at an average of 160 beats per minute during a concert .
you always perform from memory - do you ever have time to relax ? i 'm passionate about cycling and can relax really well when i 'm doing that , or when i 'm playing or watching soccer .
i like to read about socio-political things and i love history .
when i stop playing percussion , i want to study history . interview : magdalene melchers -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 10.08.2009 mallorca tourists unperturbed by eta bombs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish police are unsure if the attackers are still on the island german tourists have so far not cancelled their holiday trips to the spanish resort island of mallorca , despite a recent spate of bomb attacks believed to have been organized by basque separatist group eta . thousands of mainly german and british holidaymakers flock to the resort island of mallorca each year , and these bomb attacks have come at the height of the tourist season .
it 's another blow to the local tourist industry , with many travelers already concerned about the large number of swine flu cases on the island .
a spokesperson from the german foreign ministry told deutsche welle that the ministry has updated its travel information to make tourists aware of the bombings , with tips such as trying to avoid large crowds .
however , the ministry has not issued a travel warning for mallorca and early indications are that the bombs have not caused tourists to cut short their summer breaks .
sybille zeuch from the german travel association says there is currently no suggestion that the bomb attacks will drive away the 170,000 german tourists now on mallorca .
" what is different from other terrorist attacks is that eta does not want to target tourists and no one has been hurt in these attacks , " zeuch told deutsche welle .
" eta wants to spread fear but they do n't want any victims ; what they want to target is the economy . "
the spanish government has remained defiant , saying the impact on tourism from the blasts will be minimal .
" eta has been trying to inflict damage on the spanish tourism industry for 30 years , " joan mesquida , spain 's state secretary for tourism , said in palma de mallorca on monday .

all three bombs were planted in ladies ' toilets , indicating that at least one of the attackers was a woman , however police have not yet been unable to formally identify those responsible .
indications are that basque separatist group eta was behind the blasts , after police received warnings earlier in the day that attacks would occur , from someone claiming to be from eta .
the group also admitted responsibility on sunday for a number of recent attacks , including a car bomb on mallorca just over a week ago that killed two civil guards .
thanks to the warnings , no one was hurt in the explosions .
the explosives were also not particularly powerful , leading authorities to believe that the attacks were intended only as a warning and not to cause injury .
authorities are investigating whether the bombs were set off with the use of timers , which would have allowed the devices to be planted several days in advance and given those responsible time to escape .

three bomb blasts on mallorca are the latest attacks on the popular tourist destination .
while all signs point to the involvement of eta , authorities have not officially named the group over sunday 's bombings . to learn more about the eta and their strategies , deutsche welle interviewed professor paul heywood , an expert on the basque separatist group at the university of nottingham in the united kingdom .
dw : the authorities have yet to conclusively link eta to sunday 's three bomb blasts .
is there any doubt about their involvement ? paul heywood : it is almost certain this was the work of eta , they had released statements the day before about a series of previous attacks that had taken place in june and july and these latest attacks follow a very similar pattern , including two attacks on holiday resorts in the past .
from your knowledge of the way eta operates , would they have had an active cell on the island , or would they have sent in people from the mainland ?
they probably sent people in from the mainland .
now there was , of course , the assassination of two civil guards on the island in palmanova on 30th july and these bombs that went off yesterday -lrb- sunday ed . -rrb- were all on timer devices , so it is just possible that the cell which carried out the assassinations just over a week ago also planted the bombs , though it 's a long time for bombs to be on timer devices , it 's more likely that they 've still got some people on the island .
how successful have the spanish authorities been in the past in tracking down eta bombers ?
well there have been a lot of high profile arrests of eta leaders and there 's been in recent years much more effective collaboration with the french authorities , so that the french and the spanish police have worked together to capture some of the top eta leaders .
however one of the issues - it can hardly be overstressed with any organization like eta - is that they are not single organizations where there is one leadership and if you capture that leadership then the organization is undermined .
these organizations operate on the basis of numbers of different cells which operate according to different command structures within different parts of the country , and indeed , they are often characterized by splits within the organization , so eta , just like a lot of other terrorist organizations , has historically had splits between an official leadership - quite often wanting dialogue and political interaction with the government - and more militant , often younger members , who are against dialogue and want to continue the campaign of violence .
what is likely to be the impact on spain 's tourism industry ? that 's what they are aiming for - to hurt spain 's tourism industry - this is a form of economic terrorism .
the targets are not members of the public , still less actual tourists .
eta has a history of mainly targeting members of the spanish armed forces or police and recent assassinations which have taken place have been of members of the civil guard .
eta has never really gone for soft targets in the sense of members of the public or holidaymakers , tourists .
but what they do want to do to is to instil a sense of fear so that people think twice about whether they are going to visit spain on holiday and in that sense create an economic climate for the government , which of course is already struggling with the impact of recession , which makes it much more difficult for them .

three bomb blasts on mallorca are the latest attacks on the popular tourist destination .
while all signs point to the involvement of eta , authorities have not officially named the group over sunday 's bombings . to learn more about the eta and their strategies , deutsche welle interviewed professor paul heywood , an expert on the basque separatist group at the university of nottingham in the united kingdom .
dw : the authorities have yet to conclusively link eta to sunday 's three bomb blasts .
is there any doubt about their involvement ? paul heywood : it is almost certain this was the work of eta , they had released statements the day before about a series of previous attacks that had taken place in june and july and these latest attacks follow a very similar pattern , including two attacks on holiday resorts in the past .
from your knowledge of the way eta operates , would they have had an active cell on the island , or would they have sent in people from the mainland ?
they probably sent people in from the mainland .
now there was , of course , the assassination of two civil guards on the island in palmanova on 30th july and these bombs that went off yesterday -lrb- sunday ed . -rrb- were all on timer devices , so it is just possible that the cell which carried out the assassinations just over a week ago also planted the bombs , though it 's a long time for bombs to be on timer devices , it 's more likely that they 've still got some people on the island .
how successful have the spanish authorities been in the past in tracking down eta bombers ?
well there have been a lot of high profile arrests of eta leaders and there 's been in recent years much more effective collaboration with the french authorities , so that the french and the spanish police have worked together to capture some of the top eta leaders .
however one of the issues - it can hardly be overstressed with any organization like eta - is that they are not single organizations where there is one leadership and if you capture that leadership then the organization is undermined .
these organizations operate on the basis of numbers of different cells which operate according to different command structures within different parts of the country , and indeed , they are often characterized by splits within the organization , so eta , just like a lot of other terrorist organizations , has historically had splits between an official leadership - quite often wanting dialogue and political interaction with the government - and more militant , often younger members , who are against dialogue and want to continue the campaign of violence .
what is likely to be the impact on spain 's tourism industry ? that 's what they are aiming for - to hurt spain 's tourism industry - this is a form of economic terrorism .
the targets are not members of the public , still less actual tourists .
eta has a history of mainly targeting members of the spanish armed forces or police and recent assassinations which have taken place have been of members of the civil guard .
eta has never really gone for soft targets in the sense of members of the public or holidaymakers , tourists .
but what they do want to do to is to instil a sense of fear so that people think twice about whether they are going to visit spain on holiday and in that sense create an economic climate for the government , which of course is already struggling with the impact of recession , which makes it much more difficult for them .

throughout the most recent dispute with iran he has continually called for restraint .
but his patience seems to have worn thin .
the immediate reason for this is the trial in tehran against a frenchwoman and two iranian employees of the french and the british embassies .
they are all accused of spying against iran and taking part in efforts to topple the islamic system .
in an interview , mr bildt said it was a show trial .
“ i 've protested very sharply on behalf of the european union .
this is not against individual persons or countries but against the european union as a whole , and this is exactly how we are treating this matter , ” said bildt .
bildt 's comments were not received well in tehran .
hassan ghashghavi , a spokesman for the iranian foreign ministry , reacted by saying it was beyond any legal logic to claim a trial in one country would simultaneously challenge 27 other countries .
ghashgavi added that iran had never interfered in elections or trials in the eu and expected the eu to do the same .
he rejected eu calls to let the defendants go free .
“ the islamic republic of iran will stand firm against irrational demands , “ said gashghavi .
eu nations also criticize trials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clotilde reiss in the dock a spokeswoman for the british foreign office called the decision to put the british embasssy 's chief political analyst , hossein rassam on trial , fully unacceptable .
in a statement released by the french foreign ministry , the french called the accusations against reiss " without foundation . "
paris has categorically denied espionage charges levied against reiss , a lecturer at a university in iran .
clotilde reiss , a french lecturer , has confessed that she supplied information on post-election protests to foreign embassies .
the iranian employee of the british embassy has said he was sent to attend and monitor the demonstrations .
eu diplomats have suggested that the accused have made these statements under pressure .

throughout the most recent dispute with iran he has continually called for restraint .
but his patience seems to have worn thin .
the immediate reason for this is the trial in tehran against a frenchwoman and two iranian employees of the french and the british embassies .
they are all accused of spying against iran and taking part in efforts to topple the islamic system .
in an interview , mr bildt said it was a show trial .
“ i 've protested very sharply on behalf of the european union .
this is not against individual persons or countries but against the european union as a whole , and this is exactly how we are treating this matter , ” said bildt .
bildt 's comments were not received well in tehran .
hassan ghashghavi , a spokesman for the iranian foreign ministry , reacted by saying it was beyond any legal logic to claim a trial in one country would simultaneously challenge 27 other countries .
ghashgavi added that iran had never interfered in elections or trials in the eu and expected the eu to do the same .
he rejected eu calls to let the defendants go free .
“ the islamic republic of iran will stand firm against irrational demands , “ said gashghavi .
eu nations also criticize trials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clotilde reiss in the dock a spokeswoman for the british foreign office called the decision to put the british embasssy 's chief political analyst , hossein rassam on trial , fully unacceptable .
in a statement released by the french foreign ministry , the french called the accusations against reiss " without foundation . "
paris has categorically denied espionage charges levied against reiss , a lecturer at a university in iran .
clotilde reiss , a french lecturer , has confessed that she supplied information on post-election protests to foreign embassies .
the iranian employee of the british embassy has said he was sent to attend and monitor the demonstrations .
eu diplomats have suggested that the accused have made these statements under pressure .

the confessions are expected to shorten the trial of the four men . in his wide-ranging confession , suspected ring leader fritz gelowicz told the court how the group 's plans for a terror attack in germany developed .
according to his confession in a duesseldorf court , the alleged mastermind of the group took part in a three-month terrorist training camp in pakistan in 2006 .
there , a plot was hatched to attack american targets , particularly military personnel , in germany .
part of the training dealt with weapons , such as kalashnikov machine guns , and the suspects were also reportedly trained in explosives and circuitry for bomb making .
prosecution lawyer volker brinkmann said ahead of the trial that the suspects had admitted to their goal of " killing as many americans as possible . "
unprecedented confessions the members of the so-called sauerland terror cell have been questioned by police for the past four weeks since the court adjourned for its summer recess .
their written testimonies now run to over 1,500 pages .
the confessions are more extensive than expected and they are likely to speed up the trial and reduce the sentences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presiding judge ottmar breidling called the wide-ranging confessions " impressive " chief judge ottmar breidling said the questioning during the four-week break had revealed an unexpectedly " impressive " range of information .
international security expert michael lueders says the confessions could significantly reduce the length of the trial .
" in the beginning , there was talk of two years for this process , but now people talk about three or four months , " lueders told deutsche welle .
this is one of the biggest terrorism trials in germany since those involving the urban guerrillas of the red army faction in the 1970s .
suspects accused of planning massive attacks the men allegedly formed their terror cell for the islamic jihad union and stand accused of plotting at least three bomb attacks in german cities targeting us citizens .
authorities say the group aimed to carry out attacks as deadly as those of september 11 , 2001 which killed around 3,000 people in the united states .
two of the suspects , gelowicz and daniel schneider , aged 29 and 23 respectively , are german converts to islam .

selek was later caught in turkey .
although the men were apprehended before any attacks took place , the fact that such ' home grown ' terrorists may pose a real threat in germany is a major cause for concern , says international security expert michael lueders .
" not everyone who converts to islam is radical , but some people are , and this is really a room for concern for most security analysts in germany , " said lueders , " and nobody really knows how to solve this issue .

the confessions are expected to shorten the trial of the four men . in his wide-ranging confession , suspected ring leader fritz gelowicz told the court how the group 's plans for a terror attack in germany developed .
according to his confession in a duesseldorf court , the alleged mastermind of the group took part in a three-month terrorist training camp in pakistan in 2006 .
there , a plot was hatched to attack american targets , particularly military personnel , in germany .
part of the training dealt with weapons , such as kalashnikov machine guns , and the suspects were also reportedly trained in explosives and circuitry for bomb making .
prosecution lawyer volker brinkmann said ahead of the trial that the suspects had admitted to their goal of " killing as many americans as possible . "
unprecedented confessions the members of the so-called sauerland terror cell have been questioned by police for the past four weeks since the court adjourned for its summer recess .
their written testimonies now run to over 1,500 pages .
the confessions are more extensive than expected and they are likely to speed up the trial and reduce the sentences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presiding judge ottmar breidling called the wide-ranging confessions " impressive " chief judge ottmar breidling said the questioning during the four-week break had revealed an unexpectedly " impressive " range of information .
international security expert michael lueders says the confessions could significantly reduce the length of the trial .
" in the beginning , there was talk of two years for this process , but now people talk about three or four months , " lueders told deutsche welle .
this is one of the biggest terrorism trials in germany since those involving the urban guerrillas of the red army faction in the 1970s .
suspects accused of planning massive attacks the men allegedly formed their terror cell for the islamic jihad union and stand accused of plotting at least three bomb attacks in german cities targeting us citizens .
authorities say the group aimed to carry out attacks as deadly as those of september 11 , 2001 which killed around 3,000 people in the united states .
two of the suspects , gelowicz and daniel schneider , aged 29 and 23 respectively , are german converts to islam .
a third suspect , attila selek , is a 24-year-old german citizen of turkish origin , while 30-year-old adem yilmaz is a turkish national .

selek was later caught in turkey .
although the men were apprehended before any attacks took place , the fact that such ' home grown ' terrorists may pose a real threat in germany is a major cause for concern , says international security expert michael lueders .
" not everyone who converts to islam is radical , but some people are , and this is really a room for concern for most security analysts in germany , " said lueders , " and nobody really knows how to solve this issue .
so these so-called converts are really targeted by police . "
if convicted , the suspected terrorists could face up to 15 years in prison. mz / dpa / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 10.08.2009 un delegates continue battle over climate commitments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists warn that melting glaciers have already caused seas to rise delegates are meeting in bonn for the latest round of climate talks in the lead-up to a major conference in copenhagen in december .
however environmentalists warn that previous climate commitments are way off the mark . delegations from 192 countries are meeting in bonn to continue negotiations towards a global climate deal , which is to be finalised at a much-anticipated un meeting in copenhagen in december .
at the recent g-8 summit in the earthquake-devastated italian town of l 'aquila , developed nations , including the us , promised to limit global warming to two degrees celsius by 2050 .
however , climate experts and environmental groups say even two degrees is far too high and would have cataclysmic consequences .
martin kaiser , who is representing the environmental group greenpeace at the un climate talks , says an increase of two degrees would probably result in the disappearance of the amazon rainforest .
" -lrb- two degrees -rrb- would mean that sea levels would rise by one meter , and it would also mean that much arable land would become so dry that it would no longer be cultivable , " he says .
a replacement for kyoto in total , five rounds of preliminary talks will have been held by the time the copenhagen meeting roles around in december .
this third round of talks is intended as an ' informal meeting ' and is being held in bonn , as were the first two rounds . two further conferences are to be held in bangkok in september and october , and then in barcelona at the beginning of november .
the result of the last conference in bonn was a 300-page document with suggestions from the 192 negotiating countries .
the aim of this week 's meeting is to reduce the document to between 50 and 100 pages ; this will then form the basis of discussions in copenhagen .
suggestions abound ; commitments are scarce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests accompanied the last un climate talks in bonn despite the hundreds of pages of suggestions , solid commitments from un member nations have not been forthcoming .
disputes continue about who should do what and in what time frame .
there are also questions about who should provide financing for developing nations so that they can also combat the effects of climate change .
yvo de boer , the head of the un framework convention on climate change , recently told the french news agency afp that the kyoto-replacement climate treaty would be crippled without strong commitments from developed nations and would " defeat the whole purpose of the copenhagen agreement . "
developed nations have been reluctant to agree to concrete commitments without the support of developing nations , especially china and india , two of the world 's fastest growing countries with the world 's two largest populations .
however , china and india say that their commitments should not be equal to those of wealthy countries because their populations are poorer and because they say their nations ' growth would be stilted by restrictions .

praised for his musical versatility , he told dw how all musical genres are linked - and what he 's going to do when he retires . martin grubinger has performed in some of the world 's top concert halls , including the koelner philharmonie , the concertgebouw in amsterdam and carnegie hall in new york .
he is currently active in the european summer music festival scene , playing at the salzburg festival in austria and at germany 's schleswig-holstein music festival , where he is an artist in residence . deutsche welle : you 're at home in practically every musical genre .
how did you become such a versatile musician ? martin grubinger : for us percussionists , there 's a logical connection between contemporary music and jazz .
or take salsa , samba , tango , funk , fusion , rock - all of these belong together for us percussionists .
every genre has a connection to all the others and percussion is at home in all these areas . was exactly is the connection between jazz and contemporary music ? contemporary music has a lot to do with percussion because the composers today use a lot of different percussion instruments in their works .
they 're discovering the instrument , both in solo and orchestral contexts - there 's always quite a lot of percussion in contemporary compositions .
without percussion , the music would n't work - without the rhythm and the stringency . can you describe the different challenges that jazz and contemporary music involve ? yes , of course these different types of music have to be approached differently .
with jazz , you are creative and you can do a lot - every evening is different .
in contemporary music , it 's important to the composers that you stay true to the score and actually play what 's written .
that 's crucial because the composers have something particular in mind . if i were to improvise a work by iannis xenakis , for example , it would be a scandal , a falsification .
it would totally miss the composer 's idea .
xenakis mathematically calculates the relationship between the instruments .
that means if you do n't play exactly what 's in the score , the result would be total chaos . with jazz , it 's completely different .
there , you just have to stay within the meter and the harmonies and otherwise you 're pretty much free . bildunterschrift : without percussion , contemporary music would n't work , says grubinger this year , you 're an artist in residence at the schleswig-holstein music festival , where you 've given a wide variety of workshops and concerts and with diverse programs .
all of your concerts were sold out , which earned you the label " audience magnet . " yes , it 's actually really funny .
for us musicians , things happen via friendships and connections .
you hear people when you 're on tour - you sit in concerts and think , he has to play with my ensemble , i want to work with him ! in our case , we 're in a position to bring a big audience into the concert hall , so of course the good musicians want to play with us .
that 's a big advantage , because that way we can gain a lot of quality and expertise in very different areas . the other musicians who work with you have said they really enjoy it .
is there a reciprocal effect with the members of your ensemble ? it 's unbelievable what you can learn on such an evening , you 're sensitized to entirely new things .
as a percussionist , you work in one direction , then there 's a violinist who has a completely different idea of how things should sound and a much bigger palette of colors .
he has a different idea of phrasing and rhythm , and an entirely different perspective on music .
it 's important , then , to learn to say , i want to watch out for those things too . you once said you work with a sports medicine specialist to be able to perform at 100 percent capacity even when your pulse is running at an average of 160 beats per minute during a concert .
you always perform from memory - do you ever have time to relax ? i 'm passionate about cycling and can relax really well when i 'm doing that , or when i 'm playing or watching soccer .
i like to read about socio-political things and i love history .
when i stop playing percussion , i want to study history . interview : magdalene melchers -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the confessions are expected to shorten the trial of the four men . in his wide-ranging confession , suspected ring leader fritz gelowicz told the court how the group 's plans for a terror attack in germany developed .
according to his confession in a duesseldorf court , the alleged mastermind of the group took part in a three-month terrorist training camp in pakistan in 2006 .
there , a plot was hatched to attack american targets , particularly military personnel , in germany .
part of the training dealt with weapons , such as kalashnikov machine guns , and the suspects were also reportedly trained in explosives and circuitry for bomb making .
prosecution lawyer volker brinkmann said ahead of the trial that the suspects had admitted to their goal of " killing as many americans as possible . "
unprecedented confessions the members of the so-called sauerland terror cell have been questioned by police for the past four weeks since the court adjourned for its summer recess .
their written testimonies now run to over 1,500 pages .
the confessions are more extensive than expected and they are likely to speed up the trial and reduce the sentences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presiding judge ottmar breidling called the wide-ranging confessions " impressive " chief judge ottmar breidling said the questioning during the four-week break had revealed an unexpectedly " impressive " range of information .
international security expert michael lueders says the confessions could significantly reduce the length of the trial .
" in the beginning , there was talk of two years for this process , but now people talk about three or four months , " lueders told deutsche welle .
this is one of the biggest terrorism trials in germany since those involving the urban guerrillas of the red army faction in the 1970s .
suspects accused of planning massive attacks the men allegedly formed their terror cell for the islamic jihad union and stand accused of plotting at least three bomb attacks in german cities targeting us citizens .
authorities say the group aimed to carry out attacks as deadly as those of september 11 , 2001 which killed around 3,000 people in the united states .
two of the suspects , gelowicz and daniel schneider , aged 29 and 23 respectively , are german converts to islam .
a third suspect , attila selek , is a 24-year-old german citizen of turkish origin , while 30-year-old adem yilmaz is a turkish national .
the threat of ' home grown ' terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three of the suspects were arrested in september 2007 with hydrogen peroxide drums the sauerland cell is named after a western german region where three of the men were apprehended in september 2007 along with 26 detonators and 12 drums of hydrogen peroxide , a substance used in the deadly attacks on london 's transport system two years earlier .
selek was later caught in turkey .
although the men were apprehended before any attacks took place , the fact that such ' home grown ' terrorists may pose a real threat in germany is a major cause for concern , says international security expert michael lueders .
" not everyone who converts to islam is radical , but some people are , and this is really a room for concern for most security analysts in germany , " said lueders , " and nobody really knows how to solve this issue .
so these so-called converts are really targeted by police . "
if convicted , the suspected terrorists could face up to 15 years in prison. mz / dpa / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will these be the final cases of this kind ? a former nazi commander accused of ordering the murder of 14 civilians in a tuscan village back in 1944 is expected to receive his verdict on tuesday , almost a year after the trial started in the southern germany city of munich .
prosecutors allege that josef scheungraber ordered the attack as a retaliatory measure after an assault by italian partisans resulted in the deaths of two german soldiers .
prosecutors are demanding the former commander receive a life sentence despite the fact that he is 91 years old .
with the war almost 70 years in the past , any potential criminals left are certain to be well into their 80s and 90s .
but wolfgang benz , head of the center for research on anti-semitism at the technical university in berlin , told deutsche welle that it 's not up to the prosecutors to decide whether someone should be tried .
" it depends on the crime , " he said . " and that has to be looked at according to the law and the criminal code . if the man is 89 years old , if he 's sick and decrepit , then it 's the court which must decide how much he can be expected to take . "
new trials to start in october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk was extradited to germany from the us to stand trial two other trials are coming up soon .
one is that of the ukrainian-born john demjanjuk , charged with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder in world war two . he 's one of ten most wanted nazi war criminals listed by the simon wiesenthal foundation in jerusalem .
in another case , late last week a court announced that the trial of 87 year old former ss soldier heinrich boere , who has confessed to killing three dutch civilians during world war two , will start on october 28 in the western city of aachen .
boere was arrested by us forces in the netherlands after the war and confessed to the killings while he was a member of an ss hit squad which roamed the country hunting down anti-nazi resistance fighters .
he managed to escape custody , however , and fled back to germany .
he was tried in absentia by a court in the netherlands and sentenced to death in 1949 .
back in 1980 , the netherlands asked germany to extradite boere back across the border , but that request was denied .
following an indictment by a german court in 2008 , it was ruled that he would n't have to stand trial due to health reasons .
but last month an appellate court overturned that ruling , saying he was fit to stand trial .
cases winding down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 173,000 people , including hermann goering , were accused of war crimes following world war two following the end of the war some 173,000 people were accused of war crimes and while courts have been convened both by the original western occupying forces of great britain , the united states and france , as well as by the german government , only four percent , or 6,600 people , were ever convicted .
out of those around 1,100 were convicted of homicide .
trials have also been held in other countries .
the most famous of these was the case brought against adolf eichmann in israel , who was convicted of 5 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , crimes against the jewish people and membership in an outlawed organization and was sentenced to death .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was tried in israel and sentenced to death for the role he played in the holocaust and while it seems that fewer and fewer nazi war criminals can still be alive , joachim riedel , deputy head of the central office for the investigation of nazi crimes told deutsche welle that it is impossible to know how many criminals might still be found .
" most of them , one has to admit , have departed this life without ever having been brought to justice , " he said .
" and probably among them are some of the big fish .
it 's something of which one can accuse the german justice system . "
many of those arrested after the war escaped and were never found again .
the most famous example was josef mengele , a doctor at the auschwitz concentration camp , known as the " angel of death " to most of the inmates .
but riedel insists passionately that , even though only those accused of murder – which has no statute of limitations – can be tried , the process of researching into the crimes is still completely necessary .
" war crimes take place elsewhere , even persecution of the jews , " he argues , " but the extent of the industrial ' disposal ' of entire groups of the population , organised in factories of death - this is a discipline that only we germans have managed to become world champions in . to uncover this evil system , even if only in retrospect , and to describe its criminality , is the justification for continuing to pursue these disgusting crimes which cry out to heaven .

to highlight its message , diabetes uk cymru is visiting five locations to raise awareness of the life-threatening complications the disease can produce .
four other health charities are backing the initiative .
members of the public are being offered free diabetes risk assessments by 700 pharmacies across wales as part of the week-long awareness drive .
around 140,000 people in wales have diabetes in june , research by the charity showed people living in deprived parts of wales were twice as likely to have the condition as those in more affluent areas .
public health experts said efforts to prevent and treat the disease should be targeted at the most vulnerable .
diabetes bus tour monday - bangor , by the clock tuesday - aberystwyth promenade wednesday - carmarthen , guild hall sq thursday - neath , angel sq friday , sunday - barry seafront the bus times will be between 1000-1400 daily dai williams , national director of diabetes uk cymru , said : " it 's terrifying that there are around 50,000 people in wales with diabetes who do not know it .
" people can live with the condition for up to 10 years without knowing it , which means many of them have the serious complications of diabetes by the time they are diagnosed .
" the week is the perfect opportunity for people to have a diabetes risk assessment at their local pharmacy and to visit the bus to find out more about the condition .
" we want to find the missing 50,000 to ensure they can manage their diabetes well and live longer , healthier lives without complications . "
over 40 people with diabetes are taken to hospital with heart attacks every week , 17 suffer strokes and five more have amputations every week in wales .
there are two forms of diabetes , known as type 1 and type 2 .
type 1 occurs in people who are unable to produce insulin and is usually diagnosed in childhood or early adulthood and treated with insulin injections .
risk factors for type 2 diabetes , which tends to affect people as they get older , include being overweight , having a close relative with the condition , being aged over 40 or over 25 for people who are black , asian or from other ethnic minorities .

rescuers said gollum , a turkey vulture , was previously kept in a small enclosure and was unable to fly .
he has now been taken in by staff at the wheelgate theme park , near farnsfield .
falconer richard james said gollum is going through an intensive rehabilitation programme to rebuild the muscles in his wings .
mr james said : " because gollum has been housed in such a small enclosure , his wing muscles have never developed and basically he has no strength in his wings to fly .
" we are confident that with plenty of tlc and an intensive rehabilitation programme , we can rebuild his flight muscles .
" we will do everything we can to give gollum the chance to soar off into the skies for the first time . "
turkey vultures can live for about 40 years .

in a letter to former president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , mehdi karroubi said senior officials had informed him of the " shameful behaviour " taking place .
mr karroubi wrote that both male and female detainees had been raped , with some suffering serious injuries .
he asked mr rafsanjani to consult the supreme leader about the allegations .
about 200 people arrested during the mass protests sparked by june 's disputed election , which saw president mahmoud ahmadinejad re-elected by a wide margin , are still being detained .
' brutality ' in the letter addressed to mr rafsanjani in his capacity as head of the assembly of experts , mr karroubi demanded an investigation into allegations that several detainees had been sexually assaulted .
" some of those arrested -lsb- as a result -rsb- of the unrest claim that detained girls have been sexually assaulted with ... brutality , " he wrote . "
if mousavi , karroubi and -lsb- former president mohammad -rsb- khatami are the main suspects behind the soft revolution in iran , which they are , we expect the judiciary ... to go after them " yadollah javan islamic revolution guards corps " the young men in detention were also sexually assaulted in such a way that some are now suffering from depression and other physical and psychological problems , and are incapable of even leaving their homes , " he added .
mr karroubi said that the people who had told him about the allegations of sexual assault held " sensitive positions " .
" even if one account is true , it would be a tragedy for the islamic republic and it would whitewash the sins of many dictatorships , including that of the deposed shah , " he added .
on thursday , police confirmed serious rights violations had taken place at the kahrizak detention centre , where most of those arrested at the protests were sent .
the head of kahrizak was sacked and jailed on sunday along with three of his guards , who were found to have beaten detainees .
supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei ordered the closure of the centre in july , because it had failed to " preserve the rights of detainees " .
police officials have admitted that some of those held since june might have been tortured .
earlier on sunday , a senior commander of iran 's islamic revolution guards corps said that mr karroubi , and the other main defeated opposition presidential candidate , mir hossein mousavi , should be tried for inciting unrest after the election .
" if mousavi , karroubi and -lsb- former president mohammad -rsb- khatami are the main suspects behind the soft revolution in iran , which they are , we expect the judiciary ... to go after them , arrest them , put them on trial and punish them , " yadollah javan told the irna news agency .
foreign media , including the bbc , have been restricted in their coverage of iran since the election protests turned into confrontations with the authorities in which at least 30 people died .

in a letter to former president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , mehdi karroubi said senior officials had informed him of the " shameful behaviour " taking place .
mr karroubi wrote that both male and female detainees had been raped , with some suffering serious injuries .
he asked mr rafsanjani to consult the supreme leader about the allegations .
about 200 people arrested during the mass protests sparked by june 's disputed election , which saw president mahmoud ahmadinejad re-elected by a wide margin , are still being detained .
' brutality ' in the letter addressed to mr rafsanjani in his capacity as head of the assembly of experts , mr karroubi demanded an investigation into allegations that several detainees had been sexually assaulted .
" some of those arrested -lsb- as a result -rsb- of the unrest claim that detained girls have been sexually assaulted with ... brutality , " he wrote .

the head of kahrizak was sacked and jailed on sunday along with three of his guards , who were found to have beaten detainees .
supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei ordered the closure of the centre in july , because it had failed to " preserve the rights of detainees " .
police officials have admitted that some of those held since june might have been tortured .
earlier on sunday , a senior commander of iran 's islamic revolution guards corps said that mr karroubi , and the other main defeated opposition presidential candidate , mir hossein mousavi , should be tried for inciting unrest after the election .
" if mousavi , karroubi and -lsb- former president mohammad -rsb- khatami are the main suspects behind the soft revolution in iran , which they are , we expect the judiciary ... to go after them , arrest them , put them on trial and punish them , " yadollah javan told the irna news agency .

in a letter to former president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , mehdi karroubi said senior officials had informed him of the " shameful behaviour " taking place .
mr karroubi wrote that both male and female detainees had been raped , with some suffering serious injuries .
he asked mr rafsanjani to consult the supreme leader about the allegations .
about 200 people arrested during the mass protests sparked by june 's disputed election , which saw president mahmoud ahmadinejad re-elected by a wide margin , are still being detained .
' brutality ' in the letter addressed to mr rafsanjani in his capacity as head of the assembly of experts , mr karroubi demanded an investigation into allegations that several detainees had been sexually assaulted .
" some of those arrested -lsb- as a result -rsb- of the unrest claim that detained girls have been sexually assaulted with ... brutality , " he wrote .

police officials have admitted that some of those held since june might have been tortured .
earlier on sunday , a senior commander of iran 's islamic revolution guards corps said that mr karroubi , and the other main defeated opposition presidential candidate , mir hossein mousavi , should be tried for inciting unrest after the election .
" if mousavi , karroubi and -lsb- former president mohammad -rsb- khatami are the main suspects behind the soft revolution in iran , which they are , we expect the judiciary ... to go after them , arrest them , put them on trial and punish them , " yadollah javan told the irna news agency .

in a letter to former president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , mehdi karroubi said senior officials had informed him of the " shameful behaviour " taking place .
mr karroubi wrote that both male and female detainees had been raped , with some suffering serious injuries .
he asked mr rafsanjani to consult the supreme leader about the allegations .
about 200 people arrested during the mass protests sparked by june 's disputed election , which saw president mahmoud ahmadinejad re-elected by a wide margin , are still being detained .
' brutality ' in the letter addressed to mr rafsanjani in his capacity as head of the assembly of experts , mr karroubi demanded an investigation into allegations that several detainees had been sexually assaulted .
" some of those arrested -lsb- as a result -rsb- of the unrest claim that detained girls have been sexually assaulted with ... brutality , " he wrote .
if mousavi , karroubi and -lsb- former president mohammad -rsb- khatami are the main suspects behind the soft revolution in iran , which they are , we expect the judiciary ... to go after them yadollah javan islamic revolution guards corps " the young men in detention were also sexually assaulted in such a way that some are now suffering from depression and other physical and psychological problems , and are incapable of even leaving their homes , " he added .
mr karroubi said that the people who had told him about the allegations of sexual assault held " sensitive positions " .
" even if one account is true , it would be a tragedy for the islamic republic and it would whitewash the sins of many dictatorships , including that of the deposed shah , " he added .
on thursday , police confirmed serious rights violations had taken place at the kahrizak detention centre , where most of those arrested at the protests were sent .
the head of kahrizak was sacked and jailed on sunday along with three of his guards , who were found to have beaten detainees .
supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei ordered the closure of the centre in july , because it had failed to " preserve the rights of detainees " .
police officials have admitted that some of those held since june might have been tortured .
earlier on sunday , a senior commander of iran 's islamic revolution guards corps said that mr karroubi , and the other main defeated opposition presidential candidate , mir hossein mousavi , should be tried for inciting unrest after the election .
" if mousavi , karroubi and -lsb- former president mohammad -rsb- khatami are the main suspects behind the soft revolution in iran , which they are , we expect the judiciary ... to go after them , arrest them , put them on trial and punish them , " yadollah javan told the irna news agency .
foreign media , including the bbc , have been restricted in their coverage of iran since the election protests turned into confrontations with the authorities in which at least 30 people died .
