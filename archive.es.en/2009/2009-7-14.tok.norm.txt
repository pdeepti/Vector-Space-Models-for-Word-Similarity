i also regard it as a tribute to millions of citizens of our countries who did not bow to a hostile system , " buzek told the 736-member assembly in the french city of strasbourg .
" there is no you and us .
this is now our shared europe , " he said . in 2004 , the eu expanded to include 10 new member states .
three years later , two more were added , most of them from central and eastern europe . first eu parliament chief from eastern europe a former member of the solidarity trade union that ended communist rule in poland in 1989 , buzek is the first leader from eastern europe to head one of the eu 's three big institutions . buzek was prime minister of poland between 1997 and 2001 , when he presided over reforms to the country 's pensions , health sector , education system and public administration . those reforms were believed to have been unpopular among many voters , however buzek came through his term to become the first polish prime minister to serve a full term in the country 's post-communist era . it was during buzek 's years in office that poland joined nato , and under his leadership , poland moved closer to eventual membership of the european union , which it attained in 2004 .

i also regard it as a tribute to millions of citizens of our countries who did not bow to a hostile system , " buzek told the 736-member assembly in the french city of strasbourg .
" there is no you and us .
this is now our shared europe , " he said . in 2004 , the eu expanded to include 10 new member states .
three years later , two more were added , most of them from central and eastern europe . first eu parliament chief from eastern europe a former member of the solidarity trade union that ended communist rule in poland in 1989 , buzek is the first leader from eastern europe to head one of the eu 's three big institutions . buzek was prime minister of poland between 1997 and 2001 , when he presided over reforms to the country 's pensions , health sector , education system and public administration . those reforms were believed to have been unpopular among many voters , however buzek came through his term to become the first polish prime minister to serve a full term in the country 's post-communist era . it was during buzek 's years in office that poland joined nato , and under his leadership , poland moved closer to eventual membership of the european union , which it attained in 2004 .
buzek is widely considered a reconciliatory figure and not partial to power politics . on monday , buzek stressed that it was important for the parliament to gain the trust of the nearly 500 million europeans . " we have to realize we are in crisis now .
europeans are expecting a resolution of this problem .
and we also have to remember we should improve the work of the european parliament , " he said . long list of priorities buzek 's election came as no surprise , since he had the declared backing of the christian democrats , the socialists and the liberals who together hold 533 of the 736 seats in the parliament .
in the event , he won 555 votes . buzek was born in 1940 in the town of smilovice , which is now part of the czech republic .
he replaces german hans gert poettering , who is stepping down after two and a half years in office . buzek will hold the post for two-and-a-half years - half of the parliament 's five-year mandate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu parliament has made it a priority to tighten financial regulation to help prevent another financial crisis the eu parliament 's priorities include tightening regulation of the financial system to help prevent another global economic crisis and helping the eu agree a common position for talks in copenhagen on a new global deal to cap carbon emissions . the swedish presidency , which took over from the czech republic on 1 july , will lay out its priorities for the next six months on wednesday . the parliament will , however , postpone for at least two months a vote on reappointing european commission chief jose manuel barroso , a veteran portuguese conservative . sp / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german government has to be capable of acting and negotiating in brussels , " langen told the muenchner merkur newspaper , adding that an imperative mandate for berlin would turn germany into the lame duck of the eu .
earlier this month csu chairman horst seehofer said he wanted both houses of the german parliament to have a greater say in eu matters affecting germany .
but cdu european member of parliament elmar brok said the demands are unrealistic .

chancellor merkel had been hoping to rush through the amendments , which relate to how much say berlin has in the formulation of eu decisions , with time to spare ahead of german elections in september .
but unless the csu backs away from its hardliner , that target could be hard to reach .
merkel is due to join the christian socialist convention on tuesday , where the focus is likely to be on the parties ' diverging views of germany 's role in brussels .
earlier , merkel told her executive committee that the cdu has been germany 's europe party since adenauer and kohl , and that that was a legacy which had to be continued .

" the german government has to be capable of acting and negotiating in brussels , " langen told the muenchner merkur newspaper , adding that an imperative mandate for berlin would turn germany into the lame duck of the eu .

but the country 's thriving german community along the eastern border is keen on belgian unity . tucked inside a pocket of countryside , among rolling hills and pastures , lies the town of eupen .
some 73,000 german-speakers live around here , people who are known as the " last belgians . " german is belgium 's third official language - about 56 percent of the population speaks flemish , 32 percent french , and just one percent german .
still , the people in the eupen region are more committed to the belgian state than their bickering flemish and french compatriots . isabelle weykmans , culture minister for belgium 's german-speaking community , said there 's a reason this community is so dedicated to the country . " they feel good here , and they have also seen that the belgian federal state gives us a great deal of autonomy in several policies , " weykmans said . a former battleground local public radio station brf broadcasts popular german music and the community has its own newspaper and its own schools .
it boasts 25 of its own members of parliament , as well as a guaranteed seat in the european parliament . but the community was not always as secure in its status as it is today . before the 19th century , the area served as a battleground for the french , british , prussians and austrians .
when europe 's maps were redrawn after napoleon 's defeat , the region was carved up in the grab for land .
the three separate german-speaking communities - around eupen , eifel and kelmis - were divided between prussia and the netherlands , and later belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's german-speakers have stickers identifying them as such , just so they 're not overlooked according to historian els herrebout at eupen 's state archives , the history of the region has been turbulent , especially during the period after world war one . " the end of the first world war was the beginning of a very difficult episode , " herrebout said .
" the population of the territory was forced - and no one asked them - to change nationality and homeland three times within 25 years . " the first time was under the treaty of versailles , when the community was forced to become belgian .
the second was during the hitler era , when the region was annexed to nazi germany .
the third came after the second world war , when the region was taken back by belgium . " that means : three times a change of language , three times assimilation attempts , and the resistance against it , the so-called revisionism between the two world wars , " herrebout said .
" there was a very important group that wanted to go back to germany . " that desire was more cultural than it was political , he said .
but politics did later play a divisive role , often tearing families apart , when informers and collaborators emerged . herrebout said the population was punished for siding with germany when it was finally returned to belgium after the war . " they lost their right to vote , nationality rights , some of them had to leave for germany , a lot of them were in prison after the war , " he said . some german speakers also lost their jobs , leaving bitterness which only began to heal after belgium started recognizing the community 's rights . not one german identity journalist chantal delhez at the local radio and tv station brf said that the german identity in the region is confused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isabelle weykmans , right , culture minister of belgium 's german-speaking community " it 's very difficult to say there is one identity because i think those people are still looking for their identity , " delhez said .
" there are so many cultural differences , so many cultural mixtures , there is not one identity . " but for culture minister weykmans , the community 's identity is stronger than ever . she said young people like her are staying in the area .
but their multilingual skills enable them to move or commute easily across the region 's three borders . " we do n't have enough jobs in our region and lots of people are going outside , so we are a very open community , " weykmans said .
" it 's very important for us , because we are living from this mix of different cultural influences . " the key then to this tiny community 's survival is multilingualism , an openness to the outside world and regional autonomy .
perhaps there is a lesson there for belgium 's flemish and french-speaking regions , which are intent on asserting their own cultural and linguistic identities . author : nina-maria potts -lrb- sac -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the country 's thriving german community along the eastern border is keen on belgian unity . tucked inside a pocket of countryside , among rolling hills and pastures , lies the town of eupen .
some 73,000 german-speakers live around here , people who are known as the " last belgians . " german is belgium 's third official language - about 56 percent of the population speaks flemish , 32 percent french , and just one percent german .
still , the people in the eupen region are more committed to the belgian state than their bickering flemish and french compatriots . isabelle weykmans , culture minister for belgium 's german-speaking community , said there 's a reason this community is so dedicated to the country . " they feel good here , and they have also seen that the belgian federal state gives us a great deal of autonomy in several policies , " weykmans said . a former battleground local public radio station brf broadcasts popular german music and the community has its own newspaper and its own schools .
it boasts 25 of its own members of parliament , as well as a guaranteed seat in the european parliament . but the community was not always as secure in its status as it is today . before the 19th century , the area served as a battleground for the french , british , prussians and austrians .
when europe 's maps were redrawn after napoleon 's defeat , the region was carved up in the grab for land .

" the end of the first world war was the beginning of a very difficult episode , " herrebout said .
" the population of the territory was forced - and no one asked them - to change nationality and homeland three times within 25 years . " the first time was under the treaty of versailles , when the community was forced to become belgian .
the second was during the hitler era , when the region was annexed to nazi germany .
the third came after the second world war , when the region was taken back by belgium . " that means : three times a change of language , three times assimilation attempts , and the resistance against it , the so-called revisionism between the two world wars , " herrebout said .
" there was a very important group that wanted to go back to germany . " that desire was more cultural than it was political , he said .
but politics did later play a divisive role , often tearing families apart , when informers and collaborators emerged . herrebout said the population was punished for siding with germany when it was finally returned to belgium after the war . " they lost their right to vote , nationality rights , some of them had to leave for germany , a lot of them were in prison after the war , " he said . some german speakers also lost their jobs , leaving bitterness which only began to heal after belgium started recognizing the community 's rights . not one german identity journalist chantal delhez at the local radio and tv station brf said that the german identity in the region is confused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isabelle weykmans , right , culture minister of belgium 's german-speaking community " it 's very difficult to say there is one identity because i think those people are still looking for their identity , " delhez said .

but the country 's thriving german community along the eastern border is keen on belgian unity . tucked inside a pocket of countryside , among rolling hills and pastures , lies the town of eupen .
some 73,000 german-speakers live around here , people who are known as the " last belgians . " german is belgium 's third official language - about 56 percent of the population speaks flemish , 32 percent french , and just one percent german .
still , the people in the eupen region are more committed to the belgian state than their bickering flemish and french compatriots . isabelle weykmans , culture minister for belgium 's german-speaking community , said there 's a reason this community is so dedicated to the country . " they feel good here , and they have also seen that the belgian federal state gives us a great deal of autonomy in several policies , " weykmans said . a former battleground local public radio station brf broadcasts popular german music and the community has its own newspaper and its own schools .
it boasts 25 of its own members of parliament , as well as a guaranteed seat in the european parliament . but the community was not always as secure in its status as it is today . before the 19th century , the area served as a battleground for the french , british , prussians and austrians .
when europe 's maps were redrawn after napoleon 's defeat , the region was carved up in the grab for land .
the three separate german-speaking communities - around eupen , eifel and kelmis - were divided between prussia and the netherlands , and later belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's german-speakers have stickers identifying them as such , just so they 're not overlooked according to historian els herrebout at eupen 's state archives , the history of the region has been turbulent , especially during the period after world war one . " the end of the first world war was the beginning of a very difficult episode , " herrebout said .
" the population of the territory was forced - and no one asked them - to change nationality and homeland three times within 25 years . " the first time was under the treaty of versailles , when the community was forced to become belgian .
the second was during the hitler era , when the region was annexed to nazi germany .
the third came after the second world war , when the region was taken back by belgium . " that means : three times a change of language , three times assimilation attempts , and the resistance against it , the so-called revisionism between the two world wars , " herrebout said .
" there was a very important group that wanted to go back to germany . " that desire was more cultural than it was political , he said .
but politics did later play a divisive role , often tearing families apart , when informers and collaborators emerged . herrebout said the population was punished for siding with germany when it was finally returned to belgium after the war . " they lost their right to vote , nationality rights , some of them had to leave for germany , a lot of them were in prison after the war , " he said . some german speakers also lost their jobs , leaving bitterness which only began to heal after belgium started recognizing the community 's rights . not one german identity journalist chantal delhez at the local radio and tv station brf said that the german identity in the region is confused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isabelle weykmans , right , culture minister of belgium 's german-speaking community " it 's very difficult to say there is one identity because i think those people are still looking for their identity , " delhez said .
" there are so many cultural differences , so many cultural mixtures , there is not one identity . " but for culture minister weykmans , the community 's identity is stronger than ever . she said young people like her are staying in the area .
but their multilingual skills enable them to move or commute easily across the region 's three borders . " we do n't have enough jobs in our region and lots of people are going outside , so we are a very open community , " weykmans said .
" it 's very important for us , because we are living from this mix of different cultural influences . " the key then to this tiny community 's survival is multilingualism , an openness to the outside world and regional autonomy .
perhaps there is a lesson there for belgium 's flemish and french-speaking regions , which are intent on asserting their own cultural and linguistic identities . author : nina-maria potts -lrb- sac -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that 's not what 's happening in germany in an election year .
now , one minister has broken ranks and protested . german finance minister peer steinbrueck has criticized a change in government policy under which pensioners will never suffer cuts in their state pension in the future , even if wages fall .
steinbrueck has failed to win the support of his social democratic party for his criticism .
the new policy was adopted when it became clear that pensions would have to be cut as a result of the fall in average wages because of the economic crisis . steinbrueck says the change will be a burden for future generations .
but the leaders of both coalition partners , the christian democrats and the social democrats , have confirmed their support for the so-called pension guarantee .
steinbrueck not on his own bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck is known for speaking his mind however , steinbrueck , 62 , is winning support from younger politicians .
the head of the bavarian young christian democrats , stefan mueller , 34 , said that the burden of demographic change " should not be borne on the backs of the young . "
he had already won the support of the opposition and of employers ' organizations for his view . but he was seriously criticized by pensioners ' groups .
the likelihood that the pension guarantee will have to be called in is seen as small , since it looks as if wages will increase slightly this year and next .
smaller pensions in future meanwhile , the german pensions authority has issued figures which show that the pension eventually paid in future will be considerably lower than that paid out now . a 50 year old can expect a pension six percent lower than someone retiring now . and he 'll have to work until he 's 67 to get it , while the current pensioner can retire at 65. mll / ap / dpa / reuters / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that 's not what 's happening in germany in an election year .
now , one minister has broken ranks and protested . german finance minister peer steinbrueck has criticized a change in government policy under which pensioners will never suffer cuts in their state pension in the future , even if wages fall .
steinbrueck has failed to win the support of his social democratic party for his criticism .
the new policy was adopted when it became clear that pensions would have to be cut as a result of the fall in average wages because of the economic crisis . steinbrueck says the change will be a burden for future generations .
but the leaders of both coalition partners , the christian democrats and the social democrats , have confirmed their support for the so-called pension guarantee .
steinbrueck not on his own bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck is known for speaking his mind however , steinbrueck , 62 , is winning support from younger politicians .
the head of the bavarian young christian democrats , stefan mueller , 34 , said that the burden of demographic change " should not be borne on the backs of the young . "
he had already won the support of the opposition and of employers ' organizations for his view . but he was seriously criticized by pensioners ' groups .
the likelihood that the pension guarantee will have to be called in is seen as small , since it looks as if wages will increase slightly this year and next .
smaller pensions in future meanwhile , the german pensions authority has issued figures which show that the pension eventually paid in future will be considerably lower than that paid out now . a 50 year old can expect a pension six percent lower than someone retiring now . and he 'll have to work until he 's 67 to get it , while the current pensioner can retire at 65. mll / ap / dpa / reuters / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the right man for the job , says his predecessor hans-gert poettering in an interview with deutsche welle . what were some of the positive and negative aspects of your presidency of the european parliament ?
i believe that the last two and a half years were very successful and good years .
we managed to pass the climate change legislation through the european parliament in december 2008 , which was , i believe , the most important achievement .
basically , the debate about the fight against climate change began in march 2007during the german eu presidency under chancellor angela merkel .
we concluded the legislative process in december 2008 under the french presidency , and we worked very closely with the respective presidencies in order to finalize the legislation .
the german constitutional court has now given the german parliament more say in european matters .
one could also interpret this as meaning that the national parliament is now the actual place where european legislation is made .
does this not weaken the european parliament ?
first of all , i welcome the constitutional court 's decision that the lisbon treaty is compatible with the german basic law .
the court has , however , declared the legislation accompanying the treaty as unconstitutional or as not in accordance with our basic law and said that the german bundestag must have more rights within the framework of realizing the german position in european bodies .
in principle , there are no objections , but we can by no means endorse the formulations concerning the european parliament .
it is clear to me that what is right for europe must always come before what is right for individual nations .
but i must emphasize that the german bundestag has a role to play in relation to control of the federal government - of course , there must be a reasonable balance and the federal government must maintain the authority to act .
the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- and bundesrat -lrb- upper house -rrb- should play a role concerning the nation 's fundamental issues . but the national parliaments ' strengthened role should by no means detract from the role of the european parliament .
in fact , the european and the respective national bodies compliment each other .
at the european level , the european parliament and the national legislative body should compliment each other .
the bundestag has the following role respective to the council of ministers : it controls the federal government in the council of ministers .
that is the right balance .
i have never understood the constitutional court 's reaction to the european parliament .
legal entity demands that european law comes before national law . currently , the parliament and the council are embroiled in a kind of power struggle concerning barroso .
you are in favor of barroso , but are n't you actually pleased that the parliament is not adhering to a given timetable but rather exerting its influence ?
we had that debate just a few days ago in stockholm with the swedish council president , prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , and i think that the election can take place in september .
with regard to the person , i am not only in favor of stabilizing and defending the european institutions - and that includes the commission – but i also believe that jose manuel barroso has done a good job over the past years .
he is the candidate for the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which constitutes the largest parliamentary group in the european parliament by far .
and so it makes sense for the epp to provide the president of the commission .
in germany and in other eu countries , there is an ongoing debate over the question of whether europe can or should move towards becoming a federal state .
what is your position on this ?
is this a goal ?
these abstract debates are not very helpful .
having a goal-oriented theoretical discussion quickly leads to confrontation .
europe must find its answers with regard to the constitutional form and the problems we face .
the european union is special , without a precedent anywhere else in the world , it is unique .
it is remarkable that 27 european peoples manage to formulate and pass common laws with the help of a joint parliament , the council of ministers , the european court of justice and the commission .
historically , what is totally new in europe , in the european union with its by now 500 million inhabitants , is that we work out differing points of view by means of legislation and political discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and national parliaments are meant to compliment each other that is why legislation is important , maintaining our legal entity . and that is why we must insist that european law comes before national law .
if national law were to have precedence , people would do as they please , every eu nation would pick and choose what is closest to its perceived national interest .
that is why it is so important to maintain legal entity , those are , if you like , the federal elements .
but i do not wish to have a theoretical discussion , rather to say that we must solve the problems we face .
look at the energy issue : just a few years ago , everyone would have said that is a national issue , whereas today , those who are responsible know that we have to solve this problem together .
a last question concerning jerzy buzek , who is to be elected as your successor : how significant is the fact that he is from poland , one of the new eu member states ?
as it were , he symbolizes that we all belong together now .
jerzy buzek will be the first top-level representative from the nations in central europe that have joined the eu .
that is a great step forward .
if , way back in 1979 when i became a member of the european parliament in the first european elections , someone had told me that we would reach the point where poland and other eastern european countries join the european union , and that in 2009 we would have a polish parliamentary president , i would have said , that is wonderful , like a dream come true . and now it is jerzy buzek , which is wonderful , we have been friends for many years , he is the successor i favored .
we think alike , and it is marvelous that he will be president of the european parliament .
i wish him much luck with this wonderful task .

the right man for the job , says his predecessor hans-gert poettering in an interview with deutsche welle . what were some of the positive and negative aspects of your presidency of the european parliament ?
i believe that the last two and a half years were very successful and good years .
we managed to pass the climate change legislation through the european parliament in december 2008 , which was , i believe , the most important achievement .
basically , the debate about the fight against climate change began in march 2007during the german eu presidency under chancellor angela merkel .
we concluded the legislative process in december 2008 under the french presidency , and we worked very closely with the respective presidencies in order to finalize the legislation .
the german constitutional court has now given the german parliament more say in european matters .
one could also interpret this as meaning that the national parliament is now the actual place where european legislation is made .
does this not weaken the european parliament ?
first of all , i welcome the constitutional court 's decision that the lisbon treaty is compatible with the german basic law .
the court has , however , declared the legislation accompanying the treaty as unconstitutional or as not in accordance with our basic law and said that the german bundestag must have more rights within the framework of realizing the german position in european bodies .
in principle , there are no objections , but we can by no means endorse the formulations concerning the european parliament .
it is clear to me that what is right for europe must always come before what is right for individual nations .
but i must emphasize that the german bundestag has a role to play in relation to control of the federal government - of course , there must be a reasonable balance and the federal government must maintain the authority to act .
the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- and bundesrat -lrb- upper house -rrb- should play a role concerning the nation 's fundamental issues . but the national parliaments ' strengthened role should by no means detract from the role of the european parliament .
in fact , the european and the respective national bodies compliment each other .
at the european level , the european parliament and the national legislative body should compliment each other .
the bundestag has the following role respective to the council of ministers : it controls the federal government in the council of ministers .
that is the right balance .
i have never understood the constitutional court 's reaction to the european parliament .
legal entity demands that european law comes before national law . currently , the parliament and the council are embroiled in a kind of power struggle concerning barroso .
you are in favor of barroso , but are n't you actually pleased that the parliament is not adhering to a given timetable but rather exerting its influence ?
we had that debate just a few days ago in stockholm with the swedish council president , prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , and i think that the election can take place in september .
with regard to the person , i am not only in favor of stabilizing and defending the european institutions - and that includes the commission – but i also believe that jose manuel barroso has done a good job over the past years .
he is the candidate for the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which constitutes the largest parliamentary group in the european parliament by far .
and so it makes sense for the epp to provide the president of the commission .
in germany and in other eu countries , there is an ongoing debate over the question of whether europe can or should move towards becoming a federal state .
what is your position on this ?
is this a goal ?
these abstract debates are not very helpful .
having a goal-oriented theoretical discussion quickly leads to confrontation .
europe must find its answers with regard to the constitutional form and the problems we face .
the european union is special , without a precedent anywhere else in the world , it is unique .
it is remarkable that 27 european peoples manage to formulate and pass common laws with the help of a joint parliament , the council of ministers , the european court of justice and the commission .
historically , what is totally new in europe , in the european union with its by now 500 million inhabitants , is that we work out differing points of view by means of legislation and political discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and national parliaments are meant to compliment each other that is why legislation is important , maintaining our legal entity . and that is why we must insist that european law comes before national law .
if national law were to have precedence , people would do as they please , every eu nation would pick and choose what is closest to its perceived national interest .

the european union is special , without a precedent anywhere else in the world , it is unique .
it is remarkable that 27 european peoples manage to formulate and pass common laws with the help of a joint parliament , the council of ministers , the european court of justice and the commission .
historically , what is totally new in europe , in the european union with its by now 500 million inhabitants , is that we work out differing points of view by means of legislation and political discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and national parliaments are meant to compliment each other that is why legislation is important , maintaining our legal entity . and that is why we must insist that european law comes before national law .
if national law were to have precedence , people would do as they please , every eu nation would pick and choose what is closest to its perceived national interest .
that is why it is so important to maintain legal entity , those are , if you like , the federal elements .
but i do not wish to have a theoretical discussion , rather to say that we must solve the problems we face .
look at the energy issue : just a few years ago , everyone would have said that is a national issue , whereas today , those who are responsible know that we have to solve this problem together .
a last question concerning jerzy buzek , who is to be elected as your successor : how significant is the fact that he is from poland , one of the new eu member states ?
as it were , he symbolizes that we all belong together now .
jerzy buzek will be the first top-level representative from the nations in central europe that have joined the eu .
that is a great step forward .
if , way back in 1979 when i became a member of the european parliament in the first european elections , someone had told me that we would reach the point where poland and other eastern european countries join the european union , and that in 2009 we would have a polish parliamentary president , i would have said , that is wonderful , like a dream come true . and now it is jerzy buzek , which is wonderful , we have been friends for many years , he is the successor i favored .
we think alike , and it is marvelous that he will be president of the european parliament .
i wish him much luck with this wonderful task .

" what mcdonald 's will do is charge very high rates for the use of its logo and any of its patents or copyrights and use that as a basis for shipping profits out of the countries where they are generated and into places like switzerland , " christensen said .
that analysis has been echoed by other taxpayer advocates , for example , taxpayers ' alliance spokesman matthew sinclair in an interview with american public media .
so why go swiss now ?
last year , britain - one of mcdonald 's primary management locations - announced plans to close loopholes affecting company 's foreign profits from intellectual property rights .
an anonymous mcdonald 's spokesperson quoted by the financial times denied that the firm 's decision to set up headquarters in geneva was related to those plans .
still , fears that a tightening of britain 's tax code would lead to a mass exodus of big companies forced finance minister alastair darling to scrap those plans .
and despite darling 's climb down , the fears may be becoming a reality .
astonishing failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european finance ministers like germany 's peer steinbrueck face an uphill battle the british government stands to lose a significant amount of revenue as multinational firms decide to locate or relocate parts of their operations to more tax-friendly parts of the globe .
essentially , christensen says , companies will have national governments over a barrel until the latter learn to think and act internationally .
" the only solution lies in agreeing to different frameworks for taxing companies , and the logical one , almost all experts agree , is the unitary taxation system , which is the basis of taxation within the united states , " christensen told deutsche welle .
" there , states use a formula for apportioning taxes according to a formula about where the profits are actually created . "
but what works within the us does not necessarily prevent american companies from relocating abroad .
already last year , the swiss daily newspaper tagesanzeiger reported that four billion-dollar us companies were planning to relocate their corporate headquarters to the alpine nation .
" this is an astonishing failure of international cooperation , " christensen said .
" the impact on the revenues of the countries where companies actually create the profits is already enormous .
without a framework for international cooperation there 'll be a mass exodus or an accelerated race to the bottom in corporate tax rates . "
hoist by one 's own petard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london is losing out to places like geneva so why do n't countries like britain work internationally to rein in companies that , to paraphrase one of mcdonald 's best-known slogans , feel they deserve a tax break today ?
larger countries often point fingers at alleged tax havens like switzerland , luxembourg and even ireland , but much of the problem is homegrown .
" britain has been a leading player in promoting tax competition and now finds itself a major victim of it , " christensen said .
" the uk 's development strategy has not been to compete on the basis of extremely high quality infrastructure or really high levels of labor productivity .
britain 's gone the opposite way and tried to undercut taxes to attract investment . "
in other words , downing street has been beaten at its own game .
switzerland 's basic corporate tax rate , for instance , is at least eight percentage points lower than britain 's .
" the other thing is that the city of london , of course , is a massive permanent lobby for tax cuts for business , " christensen added .
" so it would be hypocritical indeed -lsb- for britain -rsb- to blame mcdonald 's for taking this decision . "
getting rid of the hypocrisy and closing international tax loopholes would require a major change of orientation not just in switzerland , but countries like britain as well .
but few believe that there 's sufficient political will for such an about-face - which is probably one reason why the golden arches ' european headquarters is to be located in geneva , not london .

last year , britain - one of mcdonald 's primary management locations - announced plans to close loopholes affecting company 's foreign profits from intellectual property rights .
an anonymous mcdonald 's spokesperson quoted by the financial times denied that the firm 's decision to set up headquarters in geneva was related to those plans .

but what works within the us does not necessarily prevent american companies from relocating abroad .
already last year , the swiss daily newspaper tagesanzeiger reported that four billion-dollar us companies were planning to relocate their corporate headquarters to the alpine nation .
" this is an astonishing failure of international cooperation , " christensen said .
" the impact on the revenues of the countries where companies actually create the profits is already enormous .

" one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , " she said at a deutsche welle press conference -lrb- 13.07.2009 -rrb- . call for political sanctions " i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , " declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and encourages people to establish solidarity with their government . instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
" diplomatic ties must not be severed , instead the embassies could be downgraded to consulates .
this would not harm the iranian people , but it would illustrate the government 's isolation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shirin ebadi did not mince her words at a press conference at deutsche welle ebadi underlined that the international media was of great importance to the iranian protest movement , specifically praising deutsche welle .

" ask siemens and nokia why they have provided iran with technologies that are used to control the internet and mobile communication , effectively suppressing the people in iran . " returning to iran ? ebadi is convinced that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys , according to ebadi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shirin ebadi and deutsche welle 's director general erik bettermann she also underlined that the government 's response to the protests was in breach of the country 's constitution and islam , adding that this was why several leading clerics had criticized the government 's illegal actions . ebadi revealed that her negotiations with high-level un officials have prompted the un to send an independent delegation to tehran to throw light on the events following the disputed june presidential election .
it is unclear whether iranian authorities will allow the delegation into the country .
and this also applies to ebadi herself .
but despite all dangers she is determined to return to tehran to her husband , her home and her work .

" i bring good news for your country and the citizens , " solana said as he arrived in macedonia as a part of his tour of western balkans .
solana arrived from belgrade , where on monday he also promised serbian citizens " good news " about visa-free travel .
" in a few days you will receive very good news on the visa regime liberalization for the serbian people , " solana said after meeting with serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic .
albania and bosnia could follow last month , eu foreign ministers encouraged the commission to propose the visa liberalization for states of the western balkans .
the eu commission is expected to submit a proposal on the issue on wednesday .
the proposal will have to be formally approved by the eu 's 27 justice ministers , although unanimity would not be required .
eu justice commissioner jacques barrot told a news briefing in brussels last week that the visa liberalization would start with serbia , montenegro and macedonia while albania and bosnia should follow later in 2010 , provided they meet certain requirements .
eu officials say macedonia has already met eu standards for visa liberalization , which include adequate border monitoring , introduction of biometric passports and steps against crime and corruption .
montenegro and serbia were expected to be able to meet all conditions by the end of the year .
the lifting of visa restrictions is seen as an important step forward in serbia , montenegro and macedonia 's hopes for moving towards eu accession .

the german president said that the marching of german troops down the champs elysees was a reminder of the " terrible history " between france and germany and that it was important the two countries drew permanent lessons from it .
" european integration and the continuation of the european project are the lasting answers to it , " koehler said .
indian prime minister manmohan singh 's presence at the bastille day celebrations is a sign of deepening relations between france and india .

lithuania 's parliament has approved a censorship bill that sharply curbs the spreading of public information that lawmakers say could harm the mental , physical , intellectual and moral development of youngsters . the bill bans 19 examples of " detrimental " information that supporting lawmakers consider harmful to the development of lithuania 's minors .
the bill prohibits any information that encourages homosexual , bi-sexual or polygamous relations .
it also bans information which " subverts family relations and degrades its values " .
this includes the distribution of images of heterosexual intercourse , death and severe injury .
the bill 's amendments , cover a broad range of other topics , including the paranormal , foul language and bad eating habits .
lithuania 's outgoing president valdas adamkus , who retired on sunday , had been highly critical of the bill and vetoed it in june .
under lithuania 's constitution , at least 71 votes were needed to override his veto , a threshold passed with ease .
on tuesday , 86 of the baltic state 's 141 lawmakers voted in favor of the bill , six were against .
adamkus 's successor , president dalia grybauskaite , can not re-impose a veto .
homosexuality is frowned upon by many in lithuania .
the vast majority of the population of 3.3 million is roman catholic .
the bill is passed , but what does it mean , exactly ?
the bill comes into law on march 2010 at the latest .
opponents see problems with it though , as it does not specifically define public dissemination nor set down the punishment for offenders .
they also argue the law is not only homophobic but will also impose broad censorship and violate lithuania 's commitments as a member of the united nations and the european union .

lithuania 's parliament has approved a censorship bill that sharply curbs the spreading of public information that lawmakers say could harm the mental , physical , intellectual and moral development of youngsters . the bill bans 19 examples of " detrimental " information that supporting lawmakers consider harmful to the development of lithuania 's minors .
the bill prohibits any information that encourages homosexual , bi-sexual or polygamous relations .
it also bans information which " subverts family relations and degrades its values " .
this includes the distribution of images of heterosexual intercourse , death and severe injury .
the bill 's amendments , cover a broad range of other topics , including the paranormal , foul language and bad eating habits .
lithuania 's outgoing president valdas adamkus , who retired on sunday , had been highly critical of the bill and vetoed it in june .
under lithuania 's constitution , at least 71 votes were needed to override his veto , a threshold passed with ease .
on tuesday , 86 of the baltic state 's 141 lawmakers voted in favor of the bill , six were against .

"
a mere 143 adults are presumed to exist , living unfavorably in two completely separate ecospheres . with so few animals left in the wild , finding a suitable mate and successfully raising young becomes a most difficult task .
with a bit of bad luck , the situation can turn critical for the entire species . here , humans are also responsible for the dramatic drop in numbers , albeit in an indirect way . the accidental introduction of myxomatosis to europe in the 1950s decimated rabbit populations across the continent . with rabbits comprising 90 percent of its diet , mass starvation of the iberian lynx soon followed . but while rabbits gradually developed immunity to the disease and recovered their numbers , the lynx remains in threat of extinction to this day . back to first page back 4/10 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite its attempts to halt the extinction of endangered species , many are still threatened with extinction . bildunterschrift : the gradual extinction of endangered species is continuing . that is the pessimistic conclusion of the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- ucn -rrb- , author of the yearly " red list of threatened species . " every four years , the group also produces an analysis of the threat facing the world 's rarest species . in april 2009 , co-author of the study jean-christophe vie delivered his hard-hitting verdict : the goal of the 2002 un convention to halt the extinction of endangered species by 2010 has not been reached . " the governments of the world should employ the same ambition in protecting nature that they use to protect the economic and financial sectors , " demanded vie .
but even climate change , which concerns the survival of our own species , occupies a place of secondary importance behind the current financial and economic crisis .
onagers , also known as asian wild asses , are most numerous on the plains of southern mongolia . illegal poaching has halved their numbers in the previous 16 years and they are now classified under the iucn 's red list as a " highly endangered " species . 1/10 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when the colorful butterflies disappear , then it certainly wo n't go unnoticed . there are species of butterfly , however , which could disappear from our environment and no one would know . the iucn is only able to investigate the threat posed to the 45,000 species which have been adequately studied . this represents only 2.7 percent of the 1.8 million species of butterfly worldwide . back to first page back 7/10 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" every four years , the group also produces an analysis of the threat facing the world 's rarest species . in april 2009 , co-author of the study jean-christophe vie delivered his hard-hitting verdict : the goal of the 2002 un convention to halt the extinction of endangered species by 2010 has not been reached . " the governments of the world should employ the same ambition in protecting nature that they use to protect the economic and financial sectors , " demanded vie .
but even climate change , which concerns the survival of our own species , occupies a place of secondary importance behind the current financial and economic crisis .
onagers , also known as asian wild asses , are most numerous on the plains of southern mongolia . illegal poaching has halved their numbers in the previous 16 years and they are now classified under the iucn 's red list as a " highly endangered " species . 1/10 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" every four years , the group also produces an analysis of the threat facing the world 's rarest species . in april 2009 , co-author of the study jean-christophe vie delivered his hard-hitting verdict : the goal of the 2002 un convention to halt the extinction of endangered species by 2010 has not been reached . " the governments of the world should employ the same ambition in protecting nature that they use to protect the economic and financial sectors , " demanded vie .
but even climate change , which concerns the survival of our own species , occupies a place of secondary importance behind the current financial and economic crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 14.07.2009 belgium 's german speakers want to keep the nation together großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eupen 's old town , the center of belgium 's german-speaking minority belgium is known for the linguistic and cultural tensions between the flemish-speaking north and the french-speaking south .
but the country 's thriving german community along the eastern border is keen on belgian unity . tucked inside a pocket of countryside , among rolling hills and pastures , lies the town of eupen .
some 73,000 german-speakers live around here , people who are known as the " last belgians . " german is belgium 's third official language - about 56 percent of the population speaks flemish , 32 percent french , and just one percent german .
still , the people in the eupen region are more committed to the belgian state than their bickering flemish and french compatriots . isabelle weykmans , culture minister for belgium 's german-speaking community , said there 's a reason this community is so dedicated to the country . " they feel good here , and they have also seen that the belgian federal state gives us a great deal of autonomy in several policies , " weykmans said . a former battleground local public radio station brf broadcasts popular german music and the community has its own newspaper and its own schools .
it boasts 25 of its own members of parliament , as well as a guaranteed seat in the european parliament . but the community was not always as secure in its status as it is today . before the 19th century , the area served as a battleground for the french , british , prussians and austrians .
when europe 's maps were redrawn after napoleon 's defeat , the region was carved up in the grab for land .
the three separate german-speaking communities - around eupen , eifel and kelmis - were divided between prussia and the netherlands , and later belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's german-speakers have stickers identifying them as such , just so they 're not overlooked according to historian els herrebout at eupen 's state archives , the history of the region has been turbulent , especially during the period after world war one . " the end of the first world war was the beginning of a very difficult episode , " herrebout said .
" the population of the territory was forced - and no one asked them - to change nationality and homeland three times within 25 years . " the first time was under the treaty of versailles , when the community was forced to become belgian .
the second was during the hitler era , when the region was annexed to nazi germany .
the third came after the second world war , when the region was taken back by belgium . " that means : three times a change of language , three times assimilation attempts , and the resistance against it , the so-called revisionism between the two world wars , " herrebout said .
" there was a very important group that wanted to go back to germany . " that desire was more cultural than it was political , he said .
but politics did later play a divisive role , often tearing families apart , when informers and collaborators emerged . herrebout said the population was punished for siding with germany when it was finally returned to belgium after the war . " they lost their right to vote , nationality rights , some of them had to leave for germany , a lot of them were in prison after the war , " he said . some german speakers also lost their jobs , leaving bitterness which only began to heal after belgium started recognizing the community 's rights . not one german identity journalist chantal delhez at the local radio and tv station brf said that the german identity in the region is confused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isabelle weykmans , right , culture minister of belgium 's german-speaking community " it 's very difficult to say there is one identity because i think those people are still looking for their identity , " delhez said .
" there are so many cultural differences , so many cultural mixtures , there is not one identity . " but for culture minister weykmans , the community 's identity is stronger than ever . she said young people like her are staying in the area .
but their multilingual skills enable them to move or commute easily across the region 's three borders . " we do n't have enough jobs in our region and lots of people are going outside , so we are a very open community , " weykmans said .
" it 's very important for us , because we are living from this mix of different cultural influences . " the key then to this tiny community 's survival is multilingualism , an openness to the outside world and regional autonomy .
perhaps there is a lesson there for belgium 's flemish and french-speaking regions , which are intent on asserting their own cultural and linguistic identities . author : nina-maria potts -lrb- sac -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that 's not what 's happening in germany in an election year .
now , one minister has broken ranks and protested . german finance minister peer steinbrueck has criticized a change in government policy under which pensioners will never suffer cuts in their state pension in the future , even if wages fall .
steinbrueck has failed to win the support of his social democratic party for his criticism .
the new policy was adopted when it became clear that pensions would have to be cut as a result of the fall in average wages because of the economic crisis . steinbrueck says the change will be a burden for future generations .
but the leaders of both coalition partners , the christian democrats and the social democrats , have confirmed their support for the so-called pension guarantee .
steinbrueck not on his own bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck is known for speaking his mind however , steinbrueck , 62 , is winning support from younger politicians .
the head of the bavarian young christian democrats , stefan mueller , 34 , said that the burden of demographic change " should not be borne on the backs of the young . "
he had already won the support of the opposition and of employers ' organizations for his view . but he was seriously criticized by pensioners ' groups .
the likelihood that the pension guarantee will have to be called in is seen as small , since it looks as if wages will increase slightly this year and next .
smaller pensions in future meanwhile , the german pensions authority has issued figures which show that the pension eventually paid in future will be considerably lower than that paid out now . a 50 year old can expect a pension six percent lower than someone retiring now . and he 'll have to work until he 's 67 to get it , while the current pensioner can retire at 65. mll / ap / dpa / reuters / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lithuania 's parliament has approved a censorship bill that sharply curbs the spreading of public information that lawmakers say could harm the mental , physical , intellectual and moral development of youngsters . the bill bans 19 examples of " detrimental " information that supporting lawmakers consider harmful to the development of lithuania 's minors .
the bill prohibits any information that encourages homosexual , bi-sexual or polygamous relations .
it also bans information which " subverts family relations and degrades its values " .
this includes the distribution of images of heterosexual intercourse , death and severe injury .
the bill 's amendments , cover a broad range of other topics , including the paranormal , foul language and bad eating habits .
lithuania 's outgoing president valdas adamkus , who retired on sunday , had been highly critical of the bill and vetoed it in june .
under lithuania 's constitution , at least 71 votes were needed to override his veto , a threshold passed with ease .
on tuesday , 86 of the baltic state 's 141 lawmakers voted in favor of the bill , six were against .
adamkus 's successor , president dalia grybauskaite , can not re-impose a veto .
homosexuality is frowned upon by many in lithuania .
the vast majority of the population of 3.3 million is roman catholic .
the bill is passed , but what does it mean , exactly ?
the bill comes into law on march 2010 at the latest .
opponents see problems with it though , as it does not specifically define public dissemination nor set down the punishment for offenders .
they also argue the law is not only homophobic but will also impose broad censorship and violate lithuania 's commitments as a member of the united nations and the european union .
" parliament has demonstrated its will to institutionalise homophobia , " said vladimir simonko , head of the lithuanian gay league .

the authorities believe the businesses were being run through some 30 front men taking orders from high-profile camorra bosses who are already in prison .
many of those mob puppets , who are now being investigated by the police , are alleged to have been operating apparently legal businesses which actually masked money laundering and other criminal activities .
" we have dealt a serious blow to the casalesi -lrb- crime family -rrb- , " anti-mafia squad chief maurizio vallone told sky tg24 news .
he said the clan was still sitting on an illegal fortune , but that a sizeable chunk of it had been removed .
many of the assets seized on tuesday belonged to mafia boss , giuseppe setola .
he is considered by police to be a " psychotic killer " and is deemed one of the most dangerous mobsters in italy .
he and those who work for him are alleged to have murdered 18 people , including eight africans last september .

but the country 's thriving german community along the eastern border is keen on belgian unity . tucked inside a pocket of countryside , among rolling hills and pastures , lies the town of eupen .
some 73,000 german-speakers live around here , people who are known as the " last belgians . " german is belgium 's third official language - about 56 percent of the population speaks flemish , 32 percent french , and just one percent german .
still , the people in the eupen region are more committed to the belgian state than their bickering flemish and french compatriots . isabelle weykmans , culture minister for belgium 's german-speaking community , said there 's a reason this community is so dedicated to the country . " they feel good here , and they have also seen that the belgian federal state gives us a great deal of autonomy in several policies , " weykmans said . a former battleground local public radio station brf broadcasts popular german music and the community has its own newspaper and its own schools .
it boasts 25 of its own members of parliament , as well as a guaranteed seat in the european parliament . but the community was not always as secure in its status as it is today . before the 19th century , the area served as a battleground for the french , british , prussians and austrians .
when europe 's maps were redrawn after napoleon 's defeat , the region was carved up in the grab for land .
the three separate german-speaking communities - around eupen , eifel and kelmis - were divided between prussia and the netherlands , and later belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's german-speakers have stickers identifying them as such , just so they 're not overlooked according to historian els herrebout at eupen 's state archives , the history of the region has been turbulent , especially during the period after world war one . " the end of the first world war was the beginning of a very difficult episode , " herrebout said .
" the population of the territory was forced - and no one asked them - to change nationality and homeland three times within 25 years . " the first time was under the treaty of versailles , when the community was forced to become belgian .
the second was during the hitler era , when the region was annexed to nazi germany .
the third came after the second world war , when the region was taken back by belgium . " that means : three times a change of language , three times assimilation attempts , and the resistance against it , the so-called revisionism between the two world wars , " herrebout said .
" there was a very important group that wanted to go back to germany . " that desire was more cultural than it was political , he said .
but politics did later play a divisive role , often tearing families apart , when informers and collaborators emerged . herrebout said the population was punished for siding with germany when it was finally returned to belgium after the war . " they lost their right to vote , nationality rights , some of them had to leave for germany , a lot of them were in prison after the war , " he said . some german speakers also lost their jobs , leaving bitterness which only began to heal after belgium started recognizing the community 's rights . not one german identity journalist chantal delhez at the local radio and tv station brf said that the german identity in the region is confused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isabelle weykmans , right , culture minister of belgium 's german-speaking community " it 's very difficult to say there is one identity because i think those people are still looking for their identity , " delhez said .
" there are so many cultural differences , so many cultural mixtures , there is not one identity . " but for culture minister weykmans , the community 's identity is stronger than ever . she said young people like her are staying in the area .
but their multilingual skills enable them to move or commute easily across the region 's three borders . " we do n't have enough jobs in our region and lots of people are going outside , so we are a very open community , " weykmans said .
" it 's very important for us , because we are living from this mix of different cultural influences . " the key then to this tiny community 's survival is multilingualism , an openness to the outside world and regional autonomy .
perhaps there is a lesson there for belgium 's flemish and french-speaking regions , which are intent on asserting their own cultural and linguistic identities . author : nina-maria potts -lrb- sac -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

union representatives at the automaker say the economics ministry is undermining magna 's position in the take-over battle by providing information to its challengers .
the challengers say they want to talk to the workers . the mass circulation bild newspaper quoted sources close to the negotiations as saying that the investment company rhj and the chinese automaker baic planned to talk with workers ' representatives . both companies face opposition from the workers , since both of their offers foresee more redundancies than the one from the austrian-canadian components manufacturer magna .
the main opel trade union , ig metall , has criticised the economics minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , for his role in the process . the local union chief , armin schild , who is also on the opel supervisory board , told the berliner zeitung newspaper , " it 's unacceptable that the sharpshooters who are torpedoing the negotiations with magna are being provided with ammunition by the economics ministry . "
he said that workers still supported magna , which was the only company which had so far sought talks with workers ' representatives .
the head of the opel works ' council , klaus franz , has warned against a take-over by rhj , a belgian subsidiary of the us company ripplewood . according to the handelsblatt newspaper , he told workers that rhj was working in the interests of general motors , the current owner of opel . ripplewood , he said , would sell opel back to gm as soon as it could , after using the state loan guarantees to win some time . that would lead to the eventual collapse of the company . mll / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the zew said its monthly index , based on a survey of almost 300 analysts , dropped to 39.5 points in july .
europe 's largest economy had been widely tipped to continue the climb it demonstrated in june , when it reached a three-year high of 44.8 points .
the figures posted by the zew index , which is closely watched by other european mood-gauging surveys , marked the first fall after eight consecutive rises .
but despite the surprise decline , the zew said the " surprisingly good numbers of incoming orders and industrial production " had had a positive influence on the 289 analysts and investors questioned for the survey .
zew president wolfgang franz said the figures confirmed the prognosis that germany 's economic development would fall by some six percent this year. tkw / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , civil unions , for instance , have been permitted among same-sex couples since 2001 , but full marriages are not .
homosexual couples therefore do not enjoy the same rights as married heterosexual couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law . for more on gay and lesbian rights and the community in germany , click on the links below , or listen to this week 's " living in germany " program to hear a more personal account of a homosexual civil union . author : louisa schaefer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but an expert critic says tax loopholes are the real reason for what 's becoming a swiss exodus . contrary to some media reports , the fast-food giant is n't relocating its european operations , but rather creating a new headquarters to coordinate activities at locations such as paris , london , munich and vienna .
" there will be no redundancies at our four pan-european offices , " mcdonald 's spokeswoman cath o 'grady told deutsche welle .
" what we 're doing is consolidating our senior management . "
o 'grady added that the consolidation would allow the company to better coordinate intellectual property rights issues , saying that geneva offered a " business-friendly environment . "
in choosing switzerland , mcdonald 's is following the examples of other multinational corporations such as kraft , proctor & gamble , google and yahoo .
critics say the real reason for the trend is to evade national tax authorities .
" of course it 's about taxes , " john christensen , director of the international secretariat at the tax justice network , an independent organization launched by the british parliament , told deutsche welle .
" intellectual property rights include things like logos , licenses , international royalty programs and patents that are bundled up and located in subsidiary companies , and the subsidiary company will be located in a tax haven like switzerland , " christensen said .
deserve a tax break today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzlerland has many attractions , also for corporations the corporate structures of mcdonald 's , like many multinational business institutions , are impenetrable to laymen .
christensen tried to explain the advantages of doing business in switzerland .
" what mcdonald 's will do is charge very high rates for the use of its logo and any of its patents or copyrights and use that as a basis for shipping profits out of the countries where they are generated and into places like switzerland , " christensen said .
that analysis has been echoed by other taxpayer advocates , for example , taxpayers ' alliance spokesman matthew sinclair in an interview with american public media .
so why go swiss now ?
last year , britain - one of mcdonald 's primary management locations - announced plans to close loopholes affecting company 's foreign profits from intellectual property rights .
an anonymous mcdonald 's spokesperson quoted by the financial times denied that the firm 's decision to set up headquarters in geneva was related to those plans .
still , fears that a tightening of britain 's tax code would lead to a mass exodus of big companies forced finance minister alastair darling to scrap those plans .
and despite darling 's climb down , the fears may be becoming a reality .
astonishing failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european finance ministers like germany 's peer steinbrueck face an uphill battle the british government stands to lose a significant amount of revenue as multinational firms decide to locate or relocate parts of their operations to more tax-friendly parts of the globe .
essentially , christensen says , companies will have national governments over a barrel until the latter learn to think and act internationally .
" the only solution lies in agreeing to different frameworks for taxing companies , and the logical one , almost all experts agree , is the unitary taxation system , which is the basis of taxation within the united states , " christensen told deutsche welle .
" there , states use a formula for apportioning taxes according to a formula about where the profits are actually created . "
but what works within the us does not necessarily prevent american companies from relocating abroad .
already last year , the swiss daily newspaper tagesanzeiger reported that four billion-dollar us companies were planning to relocate their corporate headquarters to the alpine nation .
" this is an astonishing failure of international cooperation , " christensen said .
" the impact on the revenues of the countries where companies actually create the profits is already enormous .
without a framework for international cooperation there 'll be a mass exodus or an accelerated race to the bottom in corporate tax rates . "
hoist by one 's own petard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london is losing out to places like geneva so why do n't countries like britain work internationally to rein in companies that , to paraphrase one of mcdonald 's best-known slogans , feel they deserve a tax break today ?
larger countries often point fingers at alleged tax havens like switzerland , luxembourg and even ireland , but much of the problem is homegrown .
" britain has been a leading player in promoting tax competition and now finds itself a major victim of it , " christensen said .
" the uk 's development strategy has not been to compete on the basis of extremely high quality infrastructure or really high levels of labor productivity .
britain 's gone the opposite way and tried to undercut taxes to attract investment . "
in other words , downing street has been beaten at its own game .
switzerland 's basic corporate tax rate , for instance , is at least eight percentage points lower than britain 's .
" the other thing is that the city of london , of course , is a massive permanent lobby for tax cuts for business , " christensen added .
" so it would be hypocritical indeed -lsb- for britain -rsb- to blame mcdonald 's for taking this decision . "
getting rid of the hypocrisy and closing international tax loopholes would require a major change of orientation not just in switzerland , but countries like britain as well .
but few believe that there 's sufficient political will for such an about-face - which is probably one reason why the golden arches ' european headquarters is to be located in geneva , not london .

the right man for the job , says his predecessor hans-gert poettering in an interview with deutsche welle . what were some of the positive and negative aspects of your presidency of the european parliament ?
i believe that the last two and a half years were very successful and good years .
we managed to pass the climate change legislation through the european parliament in december 2008 , which was , i believe , the most important achievement .
basically , the debate about the fight against climate change began in march 2007during the german eu presidency under chancellor angela merkel .
we concluded the legislative process in december 2008 under the french presidency , and we worked very closely with the respective presidencies in order to finalize the legislation .
the german constitutional court has now given the german parliament more say in european matters .
one could also interpret this as meaning that the national parliament is now the actual place where european legislation is made .
does this not weaken the european parliament ?
first of all , i welcome the constitutional court 's decision that the lisbon treaty is compatible with the german basic law .
the court has , however , declared the legislation accompanying the treaty as unconstitutional or as not in accordance with our basic law and said that the german bundestag must have more rights within the framework of realizing the german position in european bodies .
in principle , there are no objections , but we can by no means endorse the formulations concerning the european parliament .
it is clear to me that what is right for europe must always come before what is right for individual nations .
but i must emphasize that the german bundestag has a role to play in relation to control of the federal government - of course , there must be a reasonable balance and the federal government must maintain the authority to act .
the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- and bundesrat -lrb- upper house -rrb- should play a role concerning the nation 's fundamental issues . but the national parliaments ' strengthened role should by no means detract from the role of the european parliament .
in fact , the european and the respective national bodies compliment each other .
at the european level , the european parliament and the national legislative body should compliment each other .
the bundestag has the following role respective to the council of ministers : it controls the federal government in the council of ministers .
that is the right balance .
i have never understood the constitutional court 's reaction to the european parliament .
legal entity demands that european law comes before national law . currently , the parliament and the council are embroiled in a kind of power struggle concerning barroso .
you are in favor of barroso , but are n't you actually pleased that the parliament is not adhering to a given timetable but rather exerting its influence ?
we had that debate just a few days ago in stockholm with the swedish council president , prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , and i think that the election can take place in september .
with regard to the person , i am not only in favor of stabilizing and defending the european institutions - and that includes the commission – but i also believe that jose manuel barroso has done a good job over the past years .
he is the candidate for the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which constitutes the largest parliamentary group in the european parliament by far .
and so it makes sense for the epp to provide the president of the commission .
in germany and in other eu countries , there is an ongoing debate over the question of whether europe can or should move towards becoming a federal state .
what is your position on this ?
is this a goal ?
these abstract debates are not very helpful .
having a goal-oriented theoretical discussion quickly leads to confrontation .
europe must find its answers with regard to the constitutional form and the problems we face .
the european union is special , without a precedent anywhere else in the world , it is unique .
it is remarkable that 27 european peoples manage to formulate and pass common laws with the help of a joint parliament , the council of ministers , the european court of justice and the commission .
historically , what is totally new in europe , in the european union with its by now 500 million inhabitants , is that we work out differing points of view by means of legislation and political discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and national parliaments are meant to compliment each other that is why legislation is important , maintaining our legal entity . and that is why we must insist that european law comes before national law .
if national law were to have precedence , people would do as they please , every eu nation would pick and choose what is closest to its perceived national interest .
that is why it is so important to maintain legal entity , those are , if you like , the federal elements .
but i do not wish to have a theoretical discussion , rather to say that we must solve the problems we face .
look at the energy issue : just a few years ago , everyone would have said that is a national issue , whereas today , those who are responsible know that we have to solve this problem together .
a last question concerning jerzy buzek , who is to be elected as your successor : how significant is the fact that he is from poland , one of the new eu member states ?
as it were , he symbolizes that we all belong together now .
jerzy buzek will be the first top-level representative from the nations in central europe that have joined the eu .
that is a great step forward .
if , way back in 1979 when i became a member of the european parliament in the first european elections , someone had told me that we would reach the point where poland and other eastern european countries join the european union , and that in 2009 we would have a polish parliamentary president , i would have said , that is wonderful , like a dream come true . and now it is jerzy buzek , which is wonderful , we have been friends for many years , he is the successor i favored .
we think alike , and it is marvelous that he will be president of the european parliament .
i wish him much luck with this wonderful task .

i believe that the last two and a half years were very successful and good years .
we managed to pass the climate change legislation through the european parliament in december 2008 , which was , i believe , the most important achievement .
basically , the debate about the fight against climate change began in march 2007during the german eu presidency under chancellor angela merkel .
we concluded the legislative process in december 2008 under the french presidency , and we worked very closely with the respective presidencies in order to finalize the legislation .
the german constitutional court has now given the german parliament more say in european matters .
one could also interpret this as meaning that the national parliament is now the actual place where european legislation is made .
does this not weaken the european parliament ?
first of all , i welcome the constitutional court 's decision that the lisbon treaty is compatible with the german basic law .
the court has , however , declared the legislation accompanying the treaty as unconstitutional or as not in accordance with our basic law and said that the german bundestag must have more rights within the framework of realizing the german position in european bodies .
in principle , there are no objections , but we can by no means endorse the formulations concerning the european parliament .
it is clear to me that what is right for europe must always come before what is right for individual nations .
but i must emphasize that the german bundestag has a role to play in relation to control of the federal government - of course , there must be a reasonable balance and the federal government must maintain the authority to act .
the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- and bundesrat -lrb- upper house -rrb- should play a role concerning the nation 's fundamental issues . but the national parliaments ' strengthened role should by no means detract from the role of the european parliament .
in fact , the european and the respective national bodies compliment each other .
at the european level , the european parliament and the national legislative body should compliment each other .
the bundestag has the following role respective to the council of ministers : it controls the federal government in the council of ministers .
that is the right balance .
i have never understood the constitutional court 's reaction to the european parliament .
legal entity demands that european law comes before national law . currently , the parliament and the council are embroiled in a kind of power struggle concerning barroso .
you are in favor of barroso , but are n't you actually pleased that the parliament is not adhering to a given timetable but rather exerting its influence ?
we had that debate just a few days ago in stockholm with the swedish council president , prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , and i think that the election can take place in september .
with regard to the person , i am not only in favor of stabilizing and defending the european institutions - and that includes the commission – but i also believe that jose manuel barroso has done a good job over the past years .
he is the candidate for the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which constitutes the largest parliamentary group in the european parliament by far .
and so it makes sense for the epp to provide the president of the commission .
in germany and in other eu countries , there is an ongoing debate over the question of whether europe can or should move towards becoming a federal state .
what is your position on this ?
is this a goal ?
these abstract debates are not very helpful .
having a goal-oriented theoretical discussion quickly leads to confrontation .
europe must find its answers with regard to the constitutional form and the problems we face .
the european union is special , without a precedent anywhere else in the world , it is unique .
it is remarkable that 27 european peoples manage to formulate and pass common laws with the help of a joint parliament , the council of ministers , the european court of justice and the commission .
historically , what is totally new in europe , in the european union with its by now 500 million inhabitants , is that we work out differing points of view by means of legislation and political discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and national parliaments are meant to compliment each other that is why legislation is important , maintaining our legal entity . and that is why we must insist that european law comes before national law .
if national law were to have precedence , people would do as they please , every eu nation would pick and choose what is closest to its perceived national interest .
that is why it is so important to maintain legal entity , those are , if you like , the federal elements .
but i do not wish to have a theoretical discussion , rather to say that we must solve the problems we face .
look at the energy issue : just a few years ago , everyone would have said that is a national issue , whereas today , those who are responsible know that we have to solve this problem together .
a last question concerning jerzy buzek , who is to be elected as your successor : how significant is the fact that he is from poland , one of the new eu member states ?
as it were , he symbolizes that we all belong together now .
jerzy buzek will be the first top-level representative from the nations in central europe that have joined the eu .
that is a great step forward .
if , way back in 1979 when i became a member of the european parliament in the first european elections , someone had told me that we would reach the point where poland and other eastern european countries join the european union , and that in 2009 we would have a polish parliamentary president , i would have said , that is wonderful , like a dream come true . and now it is jerzy buzek , which is wonderful , we have been friends for many years , he is the successor i favored .
we think alike , and it is marvelous that he will be president of the european parliament .
i wish him much luck with this wonderful task .

many of those mob puppets , who are now being investigated by the police , are alleged to have been operating apparently legal businesses which actually masked money laundering and other criminal activities .
" we have dealt a serious blow to the casalesi -lrb- crime family -rrb- , " anti-mafia squad chief maurizio vallone told sky tg24 news .
he said the clan was still sitting on an illegal fortune , but that a sizeable chunk of it had been removed .

he is considered by police to be a " psychotic killer " and is deemed one of the most dangerous mobsters in italy .
he and those who work for him are alleged to have murdered 18 people , including eight africans last september .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : switzerland expats caught in us-swiss banking dispute us federal court judge approves delay in ubs tax secrecy trial taxes -pipe- 14.07.2009 mcdonald 's becomes latest firm to follow the lure of low-tax switzerland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's is moving its top brass to the land of fondue geneva is to become the european center of the golden arches - a move the company says is to coordinate senior management .
but an expert critic says tax loopholes are the real reason for what 's becoming a swiss exodus . contrary to some media reports , the fast-food giant is n't relocating its european operations , but rather creating a new headquarters to coordinate activities at locations such as paris , london , munich and vienna .
" there will be no redundancies at our four pan-european offices , " mcdonald 's spokeswoman cath o 'grady told deutsche welle .
" what we 're doing is consolidating our senior management . "
o 'grady added that the consolidation would allow the company to better coordinate intellectual property rights issues , saying that geneva offered a " business-friendly environment . "
in choosing switzerland , mcdonald 's is following the examples of other multinational corporations such as kraft , proctor & gamble , google and yahoo .
critics say the real reason for the trend is to evade national tax authorities .
" of course it 's about taxes , " john christensen , director of the international secretariat at the tax justice network , an independent organization launched by the british parliament , told deutsche welle .
" intellectual property rights include things like logos , licenses , international royalty programs and patents that are bundled up and located in subsidiary companies , and the subsidiary company will be located in a tax haven like switzerland , " christensen said .
deserve a tax break today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzlerland has many attractions , also for corporations the corporate structures of mcdonald 's , like many multinational business institutions , are impenetrable to laymen .
christensen tried to explain the advantages of doing business in switzerland .
" what mcdonald 's will do is charge very high rates for the use of its logo and any of its patents or copyrights and use that as a basis for shipping profits out of the countries where they are generated and into places like switzerland , " christensen said .
that analysis has been echoed by other taxpayer advocates , for example , taxpayers ' alliance spokesman matthew sinclair in an interview with american public media .
so why go swiss now ?
last year , britain - one of mcdonald 's primary management locations - announced plans to close loopholes affecting company 's foreign profits from intellectual property rights .
an anonymous mcdonald 's spokesperson quoted by the financial times denied that the firm 's decision to set up headquarters in geneva was related to those plans .
still , fears that a tightening of britain 's tax code would lead to a mass exodus of big companies forced finance minister alastair darling to scrap those plans .
and despite darling 's climb down , the fears may be becoming a reality .
astonishing failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european finance ministers like germany 's peer steinbrueck face an uphill battle the british government stands to lose a significant amount of revenue as multinational firms decide to locate or relocate parts of their operations to more tax-friendly parts of the globe .
essentially , christensen says , companies will have national governments over a barrel until the latter learn to think and act internationally .
" the only solution lies in agreeing to different frameworks for taxing companies , and the logical one , almost all experts agree , is the unitary taxation system , which is the basis of taxation within the united states , " christensen told deutsche welle .
" there , states use a formula for apportioning taxes according to a formula about where the profits are actually created . "
but what works within the us does not necessarily prevent american companies from relocating abroad .
already last year , the swiss daily newspaper tagesanzeiger reported that four billion-dollar us companies were planning to relocate their corporate headquarters to the alpine nation .
" this is an astonishing failure of international cooperation , " christensen said .
" the impact on the revenues of the countries where companies actually create the profits is already enormous .
without a framework for international cooperation there 'll be a mass exodus or an accelerated race to the bottom in corporate tax rates . "
hoist by one 's own petard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london is losing out to places like geneva so why do n't countries like britain work internationally to rein in companies that , to paraphrase one of mcdonald 's best-known slogans , feel they deserve a tax break today ?
larger countries often point fingers at alleged tax havens like switzerland , luxembourg and even ireland , but much of the problem is homegrown .
" britain has been a leading player in promoting tax competition and now finds itself a major victim of it , " christensen said .
" the uk 's development strategy has not been to compete on the basis of extremely high quality infrastructure or really high levels of labor productivity .
britain 's gone the opposite way and tried to undercut taxes to attract investment . "
in other words , downing street has been beaten at its own game .
switzerland 's basic corporate tax rate , for instance , is at least eight percentage points lower than britain 's .
" the other thing is that the city of london , of course , is a massive permanent lobby for tax cuts for business , " christensen added .
" so it would be hypocritical indeed -lsb- for britain -rsb- to blame mcdonald 's for taking this decision . "
getting rid of the hypocrisy and closing international tax loopholes would require a major change of orientation not just in switzerland , but countries like britain as well .
but few believe that there 's sufficient political will for such an about-face - which is probably one reason why the golden arches ' european headquarters is to be located in geneva , not london .

i also regard it as a tribute to millions of citizens of our countries who did not bow to a hostile system , " buzek told the 736-member assembly in the french city of strasbourg .
" there is no you and us .
this is now our shared europe , " he said . in 2004 , the eu expanded to include 10 new member states .
three years later , two more were added , most of them from central and eastern europe . first eu parliament chief from eastern europe a former member of the solidarity trade union that ended communist rule in poland in 1989 , buzek is the first leader from eastern europe to head one of the eu 's three big institutions . buzek was prime minister of poland between 1997 and 2001 , when he presided over reforms to the country 's pensions , health sector , education system and public administration . those reforms were believed to have been unpopular among many voters , however buzek came through his term to become the first polish prime minister to serve a full term in the country 's post-communist era . it was during buzek 's years in office that poland joined nato , and under his leadership , poland moved closer to eventual membership of the european union , which it attained in 2004 .
buzek is widely considered a reconciliatory figure and not partial to power politics . on monday , buzek stressed that it was important for the parliament to gain the trust of the nearly 500 million europeans . " we have to realize we are in crisis now .
europeans are expecting a resolution of this problem .
and we also have to remember we should improve the work of the european parliament , " he said . long list of priorities buzek 's election came as no surprise , since he had the declared backing of the christian democrats , the socialists and the liberals who together hold 533 of the 736 seats in the parliament .
in the event , he won 555 votes . buzek was born in 1940 in the town of smilovice , which is now part of the czech republic .
he replaces german hans gert poettering , who is stepping down after two and a half years in office . buzek will hold the post for two-and-a-half years - half of the parliament 's five-year mandate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu parliament has made it a priority to tighten financial regulation to help prevent another financial crisis the eu parliament 's priorities include tightening regulation of the financial system to help prevent another global economic crisis and helping the eu agree a common position for talks in copenhagen on a new global deal to cap carbon emissions . the swedish presidency , which took over from the czech republic on 1 july , will lay out its priorities for the next six months on wednesday . the parliament will , however , postpone for at least two months a vote on reappointing european commission chief jose manuel barroso , a veteran portuguese conservative . sp / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so why go swiss now ?
last year , britain - one of mcdonald 's primary management locations - announced plans to close loopholes affecting company 's foreign profits from intellectual property rights .
an anonymous mcdonald 's spokesperson quoted by the financial times denied that the firm 's decision to set up headquarters in geneva was related to those plans .

" this is an astonishing failure of international cooperation , " christensen said .

switzerland 's basic corporate tax rate , for instance , is at least eight percentage points lower than britain 's .

lithuania 's parliament has approved a censorship bill that sharply curbs the spreading of public information that lawmakers say could harm the mental , physical , intellectual and moral development of youngsters . the bill bans 19 examples of " detrimental " information that supporting lawmakers consider harmful to the development of lithuania 's minors .
the bill prohibits any information that encourages homosexual , bi-sexual or polygamous relations .
it also bans information which " subverts family relations and degrades its values " .
this includes the distribution of images of heterosexual intercourse , death and severe injury .
the bill 's amendments , cover a broad range of other topics , including the paranormal , foul language and bad eating habits .
lithuania 's outgoing president valdas adamkus , who retired on sunday , had been highly critical of the bill and vetoed it in june .
under lithuania 's constitution , at least 71 votes were needed to override his veto , a threshold passed with ease .
on tuesday , 86 of the baltic state 's 141 lawmakers voted in favor of the bill , six were against .
adamkus 's successor , president dalia grybauskaite , can not re-impose a veto .
homosexuality is frowned upon by many in lithuania .
the vast majority of the population of 3.3 million is roman catholic .
the bill is passed , but what does it mean , exactly ?
the bill comes into law on march 2010 at the latest .
opponents see problems with it though , as it does not specifically define public dissemination nor set down the punishment for offenders .
they also argue the law is not only homophobic but will also impose broad censorship and violate lithuania 's commitments as a member of the united nations and the european union .
" parliament has demonstrated its will to institutionalise homophobia , " said vladimir simonko , head of the lithuanian gay league .

but the country 's thriving german community along the eastern border is keen on belgian unity . tucked inside a pocket of countryside , among rolling hills and pastures , lies the town of eupen .
some 73,000 german-speakers live around here , people who are known as the " last belgians . " german is belgium 's third official language - about 56 percent of the population speaks flemish , 32 percent french , and just one percent german .
still , the people in the eupen region are more committed to the belgian state than their bickering flemish and french compatriots . isabelle weykmans , culture minister for belgium 's german-speaking community , said there 's a reason this community is so dedicated to the country . " they feel good here , and they have also seen that the belgian federal state gives us a great deal of autonomy in several policies , " weykmans said . a former battleground local public radio station brf broadcasts popular german music and the community has its own newspaper and its own schools .
it boasts 25 of its own members of parliament , as well as a guaranteed seat in the european parliament . but the community was not always as secure in its status as it is today . before the 19th century , the area served as a battleground for the french , british , prussians and austrians .
when europe 's maps were redrawn after napoleon 's defeat , the region was carved up in the grab for land .
the three separate german-speaking communities - around eupen , eifel and kelmis - were divided between prussia and the netherlands , and later belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's german-speakers have stickers identifying them as such , just so they 're not overlooked according to historian els herrebout at eupen 's state archives , the history of the region has been turbulent , especially during the period after world war one . " the end of the first world war was the beginning of a very difficult episode , " herrebout said .
" the population of the territory was forced - and no one asked them - to change nationality and homeland three times within 25 years . " the first time was under the treaty of versailles , when the community was forced to become belgian .
the second was during the hitler era , when the region was annexed to nazi germany .
the third came after the second world war , when the region was taken back by belgium . " that means : three times a change of language , three times assimilation attempts , and the resistance against it , the so-called revisionism between the two world wars , " herrebout said .
" there was a very important group that wanted to go back to germany . " that desire was more cultural than it was political , he said .
but politics did later play a divisive role , often tearing families apart , when informers and collaborators emerged . herrebout said the population was punished for siding with germany when it was finally returned to belgium after the war . " they lost their right to vote , nationality rights , some of them had to leave for germany , a lot of them were in prison after the war , " he said . some german speakers also lost their jobs , leaving bitterness which only began to heal after belgium started recognizing the community 's rights . not one german identity journalist chantal delhez at the local radio and tv station brf said that the german identity in the region is confused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isabelle weykmans , right , culture minister of belgium 's german-speaking community " it 's very difficult to say there is one identity because i think those people are still looking for their identity , " delhez said .
" there are so many cultural differences , so many cultural mixtures , there is not one identity . " but for culture minister weykmans , the community 's identity is stronger than ever . she said young people like her are staying in the area .
but their multilingual skills enable them to move or commute easily across the region 's three borders . " we do n't have enough jobs in our region and lots of people are going outside , so we are a very open community , " weykmans said .
" it 's very important for us , because we are living from this mix of different cultural influences . " the key then to this tiny community 's survival is multilingualism , an openness to the outside world and regional autonomy .

it boasts 25 of its own members of parliament , as well as a guaranteed seat in the european parliament . but the community was not always as secure in its status as it is today . before the 19th century , the area served as a battleground for the french , british , prussians and austrians .
when europe 's maps were redrawn after napoleon 's defeat , the region was carved up in the grab for land .
the three separate german-speaking communities - around eupen , eifel and kelmis - were divided between prussia and the netherlands , and later belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's german-speakers have stickers identifying them as such , just so they 're not overlooked according to historian els herrebout at eupen 's state archives , the history of the region has been turbulent , especially during the period after world war one . " the end of the first world war was the beginning of a very difficult episode , " herrebout said .
" the population of the territory was forced - and no one asked them - to change nationality and homeland three times within 25 years . " the first time was under the treaty of versailles , when the community was forced to become belgian .
the second was during the hitler era , when the region was annexed to nazi germany .
the third came after the second world war , when the region was taken back by belgium . " that means : three times a change of language , three times assimilation attempts , and the resistance against it , the so-called revisionism between the two world wars , " herrebout said .
" there was a very important group that wanted to go back to germany . " that desire was more cultural than it was political , he said .
but politics did later play a divisive role , often tearing families apart , when informers and collaborators emerged . herrebout said the population was punished for siding with germany when it was finally returned to belgium after the war . " they lost their right to vote , nationality rights , some of them had to leave for germany , a lot of them were in prison after the war , " he said . some german speakers also lost their jobs , leaving bitterness which only began to heal after belgium started recognizing the community 's rights . not one german identity journalist chantal delhez at the local radio and tv station brf said that the german identity in the region is confused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isabelle weykmans , right , culture minister of belgium 's german-speaking community " it 's very difficult to say there is one identity because i think those people are still looking for their identity , " delhez said .
" there are so many cultural differences , so many cultural mixtures , there is not one identity . " but for culture minister weykmans , the community 's identity is stronger than ever . she said young people like her are staying in the area .
but their multilingual skills enable them to move or commute easily across the region 's three borders . " we do n't have enough jobs in our region and lots of people are going outside , so we are a very open community , " weykmans said .
" it 's very important for us , because we are living from this mix of different cultural influences . " the key then to this tiny community 's survival is multilingualism , an openness to the outside world and regional autonomy .
perhaps there is a lesson there for belgium 's flemish and french-speaking regions , which are intent on asserting their own cultural and linguistic identities . author : nina-maria potts -lrb- sac -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

homosexual couples therefore do not enjoy the same rights as married heterosexual couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law . for more on gay and lesbian rights and the community in germany , click on the links below , or listen to this week 's " living in germany " program to hear a more personal account of a homosexual civil union . author : louisa schaefer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 14.07.2009 belgium 's german speakers want to keep the nation together großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eupen 's old town , the center of belgium 's german-speaking minority belgium is known for the linguistic and cultural tensions between the flemish-speaking north and the french-speaking south .
but the country 's thriving german community along the eastern border is keen on belgian unity . tucked inside a pocket of countryside , among rolling hills and pastures , lies the town of eupen .
some 73,000 german-speakers live around here , people who are known as the " last belgians . " german is belgium 's third official language - about 56 percent of the population speaks flemish , 32 percent french , and just one percent german .
still , the people in the eupen region are more committed to the belgian state than their bickering flemish and french compatriots . isabelle weykmans , culture minister for belgium 's german-speaking community , said there 's a reason this community is so dedicated to the country . " they feel good here , and they have also seen that the belgian federal state gives us a great deal of autonomy in several policies , " weykmans said . a former battleground local public radio station brf broadcasts popular german music and the community has its own newspaper and its own schools .
it boasts 25 of its own members of parliament , as well as a guaranteed seat in the european parliament . but the community was not always as secure in its status as it is today . before the 19th century , the area served as a battleground for the french , british , prussians and austrians .
when europe 's maps were redrawn after napoleon 's defeat , the region was carved up in the grab for land .
the three separate german-speaking communities - around eupen , eifel and kelmis - were divided between prussia and the netherlands , and later belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's german-speakers have stickers identifying them as such , just so they 're not overlooked according to historian els herrebout at eupen 's state archives , the history of the region has been turbulent , especially during the period after world war one . " the end of the first world war was the beginning of a very difficult episode , " herrebout said .
" the population of the territory was forced - and no one asked them - to change nationality and homeland three times within 25 years . " the first time was under the treaty of versailles , when the community was forced to become belgian .
the second was during the hitler era , when the region was annexed to nazi germany .
the third came after the second world war , when the region was taken back by belgium . " that means : three times a change of language , three times assimilation attempts , and the resistance against it , the so-called revisionism between the two world wars , " herrebout said .
" there was a very important group that wanted to go back to germany . " that desire was more cultural than it was political , he said .
but politics did later play a divisive role , often tearing families apart , when informers and collaborators emerged . herrebout said the population was punished for siding with germany when it was finally returned to belgium after the war . " they lost their right to vote , nationality rights , some of them had to leave for germany , a lot of them were in prison after the war , " he said . some german speakers also lost their jobs , leaving bitterness which only began to heal after belgium started recognizing the community 's rights . not one german identity journalist chantal delhez at the local radio and tv station brf said that the german identity in the region is confused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isabelle weykmans , right , culture minister of belgium 's german-speaking community " it 's very difficult to say there is one identity because i think those people are still looking for their identity , " delhez said .
" there are so many cultural differences , so many cultural mixtures , there is not one identity . " but for culture minister weykmans , the community 's identity is stronger than ever . she said young people like her are staying in the area .
but their multilingual skills enable them to move or commute easily across the region 's three borders . " we do n't have enough jobs in our region and lots of people are going outside , so we are a very open community , " weykmans said .
" it 's very important for us , because we are living from this mix of different cultural influences . " the key then to this tiny community 's survival is multilingualism , an openness to the outside world and regional autonomy .
perhaps there is a lesson there for belgium 's flemish and french-speaking regions , which are intent on asserting their own cultural and linguistic identities . author : nina-maria potts -lrb- sac -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is the first time that the 61-year-old has testified in his war crimes trial .

the former president of liberia went on to outline his " very modest " background .
he said that as a young man he had cleaned floors and washed dishes to pay for his college fees in the united states .
in 1972 , taylor left for the us where he studied , among other subjects , accountancy , before his political ambition surfaced .

the authorities believe the businesses were being run through some 30 front men taking orders from high-profile camorra bosses who are already in prison .

many of the assets seized on tuesday belonged to mafia boss , giuseppe setola .

but an expert critic says tax loopholes are the real reason for what 's becoming a swiss exodus . contrary to some media reports , the fast-food giant is n't relocating its european operations , but rather creating a new headquarters to coordinate activities at locations such as paris , london , munich and vienna .
" there will be no redundancies at our four pan-european offices , " mcdonald 's spokeswoman cath o 'grady told deutsche welle .
" what we 're doing is consolidating our senior management . "
o 'grady added that the consolidation would allow the company to better coordinate intellectual property rights issues , saying that geneva offered a " business-friendly environment . "
in choosing switzerland , mcdonald 's is following the examples of other multinational corporations such as kraft , proctor & gamble , google and yahoo .
critics say the real reason for the trend is to evade national tax authorities .
" of course it 's about taxes , " john christensen , director of the international secretariat at the tax justice network , an independent organization launched by the british parliament , told deutsche welle .
" intellectual property rights include things like logos , licenses , international royalty programs and patents that are bundled up and located in subsidiary companies , and the subsidiary company will be located in a tax haven like switzerland , " christensen said .
deserve a tax break today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzlerland has many attractions , also for corporations the corporate structures of mcdonald 's , like many multinational business institutions , are impenetrable to laymen .
christensen tried to explain the advantages of doing business in switzerland .
" what mcdonald 's will do is charge very high rates for the use of its logo and any of its patents or copyrights and use that as a basis for shipping profits out of the countries where they are generated and into places like switzerland , " christensen said .
that analysis has been echoed by other taxpayer advocates , for example , taxpayers ' alliance spokesman matthew sinclair in an interview with american public media .
so why go swiss now ?
last year , britain - one of mcdonald 's primary management locations - announced plans to close loopholes affecting company 's foreign profits from intellectual property rights .
an anonymous mcdonald 's spokesperson quoted by the financial times denied that the firm 's decision to set up headquarters in geneva was related to those plans .
still , fears that a tightening of britain 's tax code would lead to a mass exodus of big companies forced finance minister alastair darling to scrap those plans .
and despite darling 's climb down , the fears may be becoming a reality .
astonishing failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european finance ministers like germany 's peer steinbrueck face an uphill battle the british government stands to lose a significant amount of revenue as multinational firms decide to locate or relocate parts of their operations to more tax-friendly parts of the globe .
essentially , christensen says , companies will have national governments over a barrel until the latter learn to think and act internationally .
" the only solution lies in agreeing to different frameworks for taxing companies , and the logical one , almost all experts agree , is the unitary taxation system , which is the basis of taxation within the united states , " christensen told deutsche welle .
" there , states use a formula for apportioning taxes according to a formula about where the profits are actually created . "
but what works within the us does not necessarily prevent american companies from relocating abroad .
already last year , the swiss daily newspaper tagesanzeiger reported that four billion-dollar us companies were planning to relocate their corporate headquarters to the alpine nation .
" this is an astonishing failure of international cooperation , " christensen said .
" the impact on the revenues of the countries where companies actually create the profits is already enormous .
without a framework for international cooperation there 'll be a mass exodus or an accelerated race to the bottom in corporate tax rates . "
hoist by one 's own petard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london is losing out to places like geneva so why do n't countries like britain work internationally to rein in companies that , to paraphrase one of mcdonald 's best-known slogans , feel they deserve a tax break today ?
larger countries often point fingers at alleged tax havens like switzerland , luxembourg and even ireland , but much of the problem is homegrown .
" britain has been a leading player in promoting tax competition and now finds itself a major victim of it , " christensen said .
" the uk 's development strategy has not been to compete on the basis of extremely high quality infrastructure or really high levels of labor productivity .
britain 's gone the opposite way and tried to undercut taxes to attract investment . "
in other words , downing street has been beaten at its own game .
switzerland 's basic corporate tax rate , for instance , is at least eight percentage points lower than britain 's .
" the other thing is that the city of london , of course , is a massive permanent lobby for tax cuts for business , " christensen added .
" so it would be hypocritical indeed -lsb- for britain -rsb- to blame mcdonald 's for taking this decision . "
getting rid of the hypocrisy and closing international tax loopholes would require a major change of orientation not just in switzerland , but countries like britain as well .
but few believe that there 's sufficient political will for such an about-face - which is probably one reason why the golden arches ' european headquarters is to be located in geneva , not london .

we managed to pass the climate change legislation through the european parliament in december 2008 , which was , i believe , the most important achievement .
basically , the debate about the fight against climate change began in march 2007during the german eu presidency under chancellor angela merkel .
we concluded the legislative process in december 2008 under the french presidency , and we worked very closely with the respective presidencies in order to finalize the legislation .
the german constitutional court has now given the german parliament more say in european matters .
one could also interpret this as meaning that the national parliament is now the actual place where european legislation is made .
does this not weaken the european parliament ?
first of all , i welcome the constitutional court 's decision that the lisbon treaty is compatible with the german basic law .
the court has , however , declared the legislation accompanying the treaty as unconstitutional or as not in accordance with our basic law and said that the german bundestag must have more rights within the framework of realizing the german position in european bodies .
in principle , there are no objections , but we can by no means endorse the formulations concerning the european parliament .
it is clear to me that what is right for europe must always come before what is right for individual nations .
but i must emphasize that the german bundestag has a role to play in relation to control of the federal government - of course , there must be a reasonable balance and the federal government must maintain the authority to act .
the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- and bundesrat -lrb- upper house -rrb- should play a role concerning the nation 's fundamental issues . but the national parliaments ' strengthened role should by no means detract from the role of the european parliament .
in fact , the european and the respective national bodies compliment each other .
at the european level , the european parliament and the national legislative body should compliment each other .
the bundestag has the following role respective to the council of ministers : it controls the federal government in the council of ministers .
that is the right balance .
i have never understood the constitutional court 's reaction to the european parliament .
legal entity demands that european law comes before national law . currently , the parliament and the council are embroiled in a kind of power struggle concerning barroso .
you are in favor of barroso , but are n't you actually pleased that the parliament is not adhering to a given timetable but rather exerting its influence ?
we had that debate just a few days ago in stockholm with the swedish council president , prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , and i think that the election can take place in september .
with regard to the person , i am not only in favor of stabilizing and defending the european institutions - and that includes the commission – but i also believe that jose manuel barroso has done a good job over the past years .
he is the candidate for the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which constitutes the largest parliamentary group in the european parliament by far .
and so it makes sense for the epp to provide the president of the commission .
in germany and in other eu countries , there is an ongoing debate over the question of whether europe can or should move towards becoming a federal state .
what is your position on this ?
is this a goal ?
these abstract debates are not very helpful .
having a goal-oriented theoretical discussion quickly leads to confrontation .
europe must find its answers with regard to the constitutional form and the problems we face .
the european union is special , without a precedent anywhere else in the world , it is unique .
it is remarkable that 27 european peoples manage to formulate and pass common laws with the help of a joint parliament , the council of ministers , the european court of justice and the commission .
historically , what is totally new in europe , in the european union with its by now 500 million inhabitants , is that we work out differing points of view by means of legislation and political discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and national parliaments are meant to compliment each other that is why legislation is important , maintaining our legal entity . and that is why we must insist that european law comes before national law .
if national law were to have precedence , people would do as they please , every eu nation would pick and choose what is closest to its perceived national interest .
that is why it is so important to maintain legal entity , those are , if you like , the federal elements .
but i do not wish to have a theoretical discussion , rather to say that we must solve the problems we face .
look at the energy issue : just a few years ago , everyone would have said that is a national issue , whereas today , those who are responsible know that we have to solve this problem together .
a last question concerning jerzy buzek , who is to be elected as your successor : how significant is the fact that he is from poland , one of the new eu member states ?
as it were , he symbolizes that we all belong together now .
jerzy buzek will be the first top-level representative from the nations in central europe that have joined the eu .
that is a great step forward .
if , way back in 1979 when i became a member of the european parliament in the first european elections , someone had told me that we would reach the point where poland and other eastern european countries join the european union , and that in 2009 we would have a polish parliamentary president , i would have said , that is wonderful , like a dream come true . and now it is jerzy buzek , which is wonderful , we have been friends for many years , he is the successor i favored .
we think alike , and it is marvelous that he will be president of the european parliament .
i wish him much luck with this wonderful task .

the right man for the job , says his predecessor hans-gert poettering in an interview with deutsche welle . what were some of the positive and negative aspects of your presidency of the european parliament ?
i believe that the last two and a half years were very successful and good years .
we managed to pass the climate change legislation through the european parliament in december 2008 , which was , i believe , the most important achievement .
basically , the debate about the fight against climate change began in march 2007during the german eu presidency under chancellor angela merkel .
we concluded the legislative process in december 2008 under the french presidency , and we worked very closely with the respective presidencies in order to finalize the legislation .
the german constitutional court has now given the german parliament more say in european matters .
one could also interpret this as meaning that the national parliament is now the actual place where european legislation is made .
does this not weaken the european parliament ?
first of all , i welcome the constitutional court 's decision that the lisbon treaty is compatible with the german basic law .
the court has , however , declared the legislation accompanying the treaty as unconstitutional or as not in accordance with our basic law and said that the german bundestag must have more rights within the framework of realizing the german position in european bodies .
in principle , there are no objections , but we can by no means endorse the formulations concerning the european parliament .
it is clear to me that what is right for europe must always come before what is right for individual nations .
but i must emphasize that the german bundestag has a role to play in relation to control of the federal government - of course , there must be a reasonable balance and the federal government must maintain the authority to act .
the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- and bundesrat -lrb- upper house -rrb- should play a role concerning the nation 's fundamental issues . but the national parliaments ' strengthened role should by no means detract from the role of the european parliament .
in fact , the european and the respective national bodies compliment each other .
at the european level , the european parliament and the national legislative body should compliment each other .
the bundestag has the following role respective to the council of ministers : it controls the federal government in the council of ministers .
that is the right balance .
i have never understood the constitutional court 's reaction to the european parliament .
legal entity demands that european law comes before national law . currently , the parliament and the council are embroiled in a kind of power struggle concerning barroso .
you are in favor of barroso , but are n't you actually pleased that the parliament is not adhering to a given timetable but rather exerting its influence ?
we had that debate just a few days ago in stockholm with the swedish council president , prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , and i think that the election can take place in september .
with regard to the person , i am not only in favor of stabilizing and defending the european institutions - and that includes the commission – but i also believe that jose manuel barroso has done a good job over the past years .
he is the candidate for the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which constitutes the largest parliamentary group in the european parliament by far .
and so it makes sense for the epp to provide the president of the commission .
in germany and in other eu countries , there is an ongoing debate over the question of whether europe can or should move towards becoming a federal state .
what is your position on this ?
is this a goal ?
these abstract debates are not very helpful .
having a goal-oriented theoretical discussion quickly leads to confrontation .
europe must find its answers with regard to the constitutional form and the problems we face .
the european union is special , without a precedent anywhere else in the world , it is unique .
it is remarkable that 27 european peoples manage to formulate and pass common laws with the help of a joint parliament , the council of ministers , the european court of justice and the commission .
historically , what is totally new in europe , in the european union with its by now 500 million inhabitants , is that we work out differing points of view by means of legislation and political discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and national parliaments are meant to compliment each other that is why legislation is important , maintaining our legal entity . and that is why we must insist that european law comes before national law .
if national law were to have precedence , people would do as they please , every eu nation would pick and choose what is closest to its perceived national interest .
that is why it is so important to maintain legal entity , those are , if you like , the federal elements .
but i do not wish to have a theoretical discussion , rather to say that we must solve the problems we face .
look at the energy issue : just a few years ago , everyone would have said that is a national issue , whereas today , those who are responsible know that we have to solve this problem together .
a last question concerning jerzy buzek , who is to be elected as your successor : how significant is the fact that he is from poland , one of the new eu member states ?
as it were , he symbolizes that we all belong together now .
jerzy buzek will be the first top-level representative from the nations in central europe that have joined the eu .
that is a great step forward .
if , way back in 1979 when i became a member of the european parliament in the first european elections , someone had told me that we would reach the point where poland and other eastern european countries join the european union , and that in 2009 we would have a polish parliamentary president , i would have said , that is wonderful , like a dream come true . and now it is jerzy buzek , which is wonderful , we have been friends for many years , he is the successor i favored .
we think alike , and it is marvelous that he will be president of the european parliament .
i wish him much luck with this wonderful task .

the new policy was adopted when it became clear that pensions would have to be cut as a result of the fall in average wages because of the economic crisis . steinbrueck says the change will be a burden for future generations .

but that 's not what 's happening in germany in an election year .
now , one minister has broken ranks and protested . german finance minister peer steinbrueck has criticized a change in government policy under which pensioners will never suffer cuts in their state pension in the future , even if wages fall .
steinbrueck has failed to win the support of his social democratic party for his criticism .
the new policy was adopted when it became clear that pensions would have to be cut as a result of the fall in average wages because of the economic crisis . steinbrueck says the change will be a burden for future generations .
but the leaders of both coalition partners , the christian democrats and the social democrats , have confirmed their support for the so-called pension guarantee .
steinbrueck not on his own bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck is known for speaking his mind however , steinbrueck , 62 , is winning support from younger politicians .
the head of the bavarian young christian democrats , stefan mueller , 34 , said that the burden of demographic change " should not be borne on the backs of the young . "
he had already won the support of the opposition and of employers ' organizations for his view . but he was seriously criticized by pensioners ' groups .
the likelihood that the pension guarantee will have to be called in is seen as small , since it looks as if wages will increase slightly this year and next .
smaller pensions in future meanwhile , the german pensions authority has issued figures which show that the pension eventually paid in future will be considerably lower than that paid out now . a 50 year old can expect a pension six percent lower than someone retiring now . and he 'll have to work until he 's 67 to get it , while the current pensioner can retire at 65. mll / ap / dpa / reuters / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the zew said its monthly index , based on a survey of almost 300 analysts , dropped to 39.5 points in july .
europe 's largest economy had been widely tipped to continue the climb it demonstrated in june , when it reached a three-year high of 44.8 points .
the figures posted by the zew index , which is closely watched by other european mood-gauging surveys , marked the first fall after eight consecutive rises .
but despite the surprise decline , the zew said the " surprisingly good numbers of incoming orders and industrial production " had had a positive influence on the 289 analysts and investors questioned for the survey .
zew president wolfgang franz said the figures confirmed the prognosis that germany 's economic development would fall by some six percent this year. tkw / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the country 's thriving german community along the eastern border is keen on belgian unity . tucked inside a pocket of countryside , among rolling hills and pastures , lies the town of eupen .
some 73,000 german-speakers live around here , people who are known as the " last belgians . " german is belgium 's third official language - about 56 percent of the population speaks flemish , 32 percent french , and just one percent german .
still , the people in the eupen region are more committed to the belgian state than their bickering flemish and french compatriots . isabelle weykmans , culture minister for belgium 's german-speaking community , said there 's a reason this community is so dedicated to the country . " they feel good here , and they have also seen that the belgian federal state gives us a great deal of autonomy in several policies , " weykmans said . a former battleground local public radio station brf broadcasts popular german music and the community has its own newspaper and its own schools .
it boasts 25 of its own members of parliament , as well as a guaranteed seat in the european parliament . but the community was not always as secure in its status as it is today . before the 19th century , the area served as a battleground for the french , british , prussians and austrians .
when europe 's maps were redrawn after napoleon 's defeat , the region was carved up in the grab for land .
the three separate german-speaking communities - around eupen , eifel and kelmis - were divided between prussia and the netherlands , and later belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's german-speakers have stickers identifying them as such , just so they 're not overlooked according to historian els herrebout at eupen 's state archives , the history of the region has been turbulent , especially during the period after world war one . " the end of the first world war was the beginning of a very difficult episode , " herrebout said .
" the population of the territory was forced - and no one asked them - to change nationality and homeland three times within 25 years . " the first time was under the treaty of versailles , when the community was forced to become belgian .
the second was during the hitler era , when the region was annexed to nazi germany .
the third came after the second world war , when the region was taken back by belgium . " that means : three times a change of language , three times assimilation attempts , and the resistance against it , the so-called revisionism between the two world wars , " herrebout said .
" there was a very important group that wanted to go back to germany . " that desire was more cultural than it was political , he said .
but politics did later play a divisive role , often tearing families apart , when informers and collaborators emerged . herrebout said the population was punished for siding with germany when it was finally returned to belgium after the war . " they lost their right to vote , nationality rights , some of them had to leave for germany , a lot of them were in prison after the war , " he said . some german speakers also lost their jobs , leaving bitterness which only began to heal after belgium started recognizing the community 's rights . not one german identity journalist chantal delhez at the local radio and tv station brf said that the german identity in the region is confused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isabelle weykmans , right , culture minister of belgium 's german-speaking community " it 's very difficult to say there is one identity because i think those people are still looking for their identity , " delhez said .
" there are so many cultural differences , so many cultural mixtures , there is not one identity . " but for culture minister weykmans , the community 's identity is stronger than ever . she said young people like her are staying in the area .
but their multilingual skills enable them to move or commute easily across the region 's three borders . " we do n't have enough jobs in our region and lots of people are going outside , so we are a very open community , " weykmans said .
" it 's very important for us , because we are living from this mix of different cultural influences . " the key then to this tiny community 's survival is multilingualism , an openness to the outside world and regional autonomy .
perhaps there is a lesson there for belgium 's flemish and french-speaking regions , which are intent on asserting their own cultural and linguistic identities . author : nina-maria potts -lrb- sac -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
a mere 143 adults are presumed to exist , living unfavorably in two completely separate ecospheres . with so few animals left in the wild , finding a suitable mate and successfully raising young becomes a most difficult task .
with a bit of bad luck , the situation can turn critical for the entire species . here , humans are also responsible for the dramatic drop in numbers , albeit in an indirect way . the accidental introduction of myxomatosis to europe in the 1950s decimated rabbit populations across the continent . with rabbits comprising 90 percent of its diet , mass starvation of the iberian lynx soon followed . but while rabbits gradually developed immunity to the disease and recovered their numbers , the lynx remains in threat of extinction to this day . back to first page back 4/10 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is the first time that the 61-year-old has testified in his war crimes trial . " it is very , very , very unfortunate that the prosecution 's disinformation , misinformation , lies and rumours would associate me with such titles , as a murderer or rapist , " charles taylor told the special court for sierra leone -lrb- scsl -rrb- .
the former president of liberia went on to outline his " very modest " background .
he said that as a young man he had cleaned floors and washed dishes to pay for his college fees in the united states .
in 1972 , taylor left for the us where he studied , among other subjects , accountancy , before his political ambition surfaced .
" seeing the need of our liberian people , i saw myself in the future as part of the government that would help our people , " taylor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many believe sierra leone 's diamonds were the reason for the civil war echoing his lawyers who addressed the international court on monday , taylor denied all eleven charges which include ordering the recruitment of child soldiers , rape , murder and torture during leone 's 1991-2001 civil wars . during this time , taylor is said to have armed , trained and controlled revolutionary united front -lrb- ruf -rrb- rebels and ordered them to mutilate thousands of civilians in his quest to secure control of sierra leone 's diamond mines .
gruesome evidence against taylor before wrapping up their case in february , prosecutors had already interviewed 91 witnesses , many of whom provided graphic testimony .
the witnesses provided disturbing details of atrocities carried out in sierra leone , including amputations , murder of children and cannibalism .

" one wonders whether europeans are concerned only with their own security instead of with that of iranians , " she said at a deutsche welle press conference -lrb- 13.07.2009 -rrb- . call for political sanctions " i am against economic sanctions and military interventions , " declared ebadi , explaining that both are introduced at the cost of the iranian people .
she added that this , in turn , creates new battle fronts and encourages people to establish solidarity with their government . instead , she affirmed , political sanctions must be imposed .
" diplomatic ties must not be severed , instead the embassies could be downgraded to consulates .
this would not harm the iranian people , but it would illustrate the government 's isolation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shirin ebadi did not mince her words at a press conference at deutsche welle ebadi underlined that the international media was of great importance to the iranian protest movement , specifically praising deutsche welle .

" ask siemens and nokia why they have provided iran with technologies that are used to control the internet and mobile communication , effectively suppressing the people in iran . " returning to iran ? ebadi is convinced that the number of victims during the most recent protests is much higher than officially reported .
many prisoners have been isolated and prevented from contacting their families or attorneys , according to ebadi .

it is unclear whether iranian authorities will allow the delegation into the country .
and this also applies to ebadi herself .
but despite all dangers she is determined to return to tehran to her husband , her home and her work .

but an expert critic says tax loopholes are the real reason for what 's becoming a swiss exodus . contrary to some media reports , the fast-food giant is n't relocating its european operations , but rather creating a new headquarters to coordinate activities at locations such as paris , london , munich and vienna .
" there will be no redundancies at our four pan-european offices , " mcdonald 's spokeswoman cath o 'grady told deutsche welle .
" what we 're doing is consolidating our senior management . "
o 'grady added that the consolidation would allow the company to better coordinate intellectual property rights issues , saying that geneva offered a " business-friendly environment . "
in choosing switzerland , mcdonald 's is following the examples of other multinational corporations such as kraft , proctor & gamble , google and yahoo .
critics say the real reason for the trend is to evade national tax authorities .
" of course it 's about taxes , " john christensen , director of the international secretariat at the tax justice network , an independent organization launched by the british parliament , told deutsche welle .
" intellectual property rights include things like logos , licenses , international royalty programs and patents that are bundled up and located in subsidiary companies , and the subsidiary company will be located in a tax haven like switzerland , " christensen said .
deserve a tax break today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzlerland has many attractions , also for corporations the corporate structures of mcdonald 's , like many multinational business institutions , are impenetrable to laymen .
christensen tried to explain the advantages of doing business in switzerland .
" what mcdonald 's will do is charge very high rates for the use of its logo and any of its patents or copyrights and use that as a basis for shipping profits out of the countries where they are generated and into places like switzerland , " christensen said .
that analysis has been echoed by other taxpayer advocates , for example , taxpayers ' alliance spokesman matthew sinclair in an interview with american public media .
so why go swiss now ?
last year , britain - one of mcdonald 's primary management locations - announced plans to close loopholes affecting company 's foreign profits from intellectual property rights .
an anonymous mcdonald 's spokesperson quoted by the financial times denied that the firm 's decision to set up headquarters in geneva was related to those plans .
still , fears that a tightening of britain 's tax code would lead to a mass exodus of big companies forced finance minister alastair darling to scrap those plans .
and despite darling 's climb down , the fears may be becoming a reality .
astonishing failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european finance ministers like germany 's peer steinbrueck face an uphill battle the british government stands to lose a significant amount of revenue as multinational firms decide to locate or relocate parts of their operations to more tax-friendly parts of the globe .
essentially , christensen says , companies will have national governments over a barrel until the latter learn to think and act internationally .
" the only solution lies in agreeing to different frameworks for taxing companies , and the logical one , almost all experts agree , is the unitary taxation system , which is the basis of taxation within the united states , " christensen told deutsche welle .
" there , states use a formula for apportioning taxes according to a formula about where the profits are actually created . "
but what works within the us does not necessarily prevent american companies from relocating abroad .
already last year , the swiss daily newspaper tagesanzeiger reported that four billion-dollar us companies were planning to relocate their corporate headquarters to the alpine nation .
" this is an astonishing failure of international cooperation , " christensen said .
" the impact on the revenues of the countries where companies actually create the profits is already enormous .
without a framework for international cooperation there 'll be a mass exodus or an accelerated race to the bottom in corporate tax rates . "
hoist by one 's own petard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london is losing out to places like geneva so why do n't countries like britain work internationally to rein in companies that , to paraphrase one of mcdonald 's best-known slogans , feel they deserve a tax break today ?
larger countries often point fingers at alleged tax havens like switzerland , luxembourg and even ireland , but much of the problem is homegrown .
" britain has been a leading player in promoting tax competition and now finds itself a major victim of it , " christensen said .
" the uk 's development strategy has not been to compete on the basis of extremely high quality infrastructure or really high levels of labor productivity .
britain 's gone the opposite way and tried to undercut taxes to attract investment . "
in other words , downing street has been beaten at its own game .
switzerland 's basic corporate tax rate , for instance , is at least eight percentage points lower than britain 's .
" the other thing is that the city of london , of course , is a massive permanent lobby for tax cuts for business , " christensen added .
" so it would be hypocritical indeed -lsb- for britain -rsb- to blame mcdonald 's for taking this decision . "
getting rid of the hypocrisy and closing international tax loopholes would require a major change of orientation not just in switzerland , but countries like britain as well .
but few believe that there 's sufficient political will for such an about-face - which is probably one reason why the golden arches ' european headquarters is to be located in geneva , not london .

the right man for the job , says his predecessor hans-gert poettering in an interview with deutsche welle . what were some of the positive and negative aspects of your presidency of the european parliament ?
i believe that the last two and a half years were very successful and good years .
we managed to pass the climate change legislation through the european parliament in december 2008 , which was , i believe , the most important achievement .
basically , the debate about the fight against climate change began in march 2007during the german eu presidency under chancellor angela merkel .
we concluded the legislative process in december 2008 under the french presidency , and we worked very closely with the respective presidencies in order to finalize the legislation .
the german constitutional court has now given the german parliament more say in european matters .
one could also interpret this as meaning that the national parliament is now the actual place where european legislation is made .
does this not weaken the european parliament ?
first of all , i welcome the constitutional court 's decision that the lisbon treaty is compatible with the german basic law .
the court has , however , declared the legislation accompanying the treaty as unconstitutional or as not in accordance with our basic law and said that the german bundestag must have more rights within the framework of realizing the german position in european bodies .
in principle , there are no objections , but we can by no means endorse the formulations concerning the european parliament .
it is clear to me that what is right for europe must always come before what is right for individual nations .
but i must emphasize that the german bundestag has a role to play in relation to control of the federal government - of course , there must be a reasonable balance and the federal government must maintain the authority to act .
the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- and bundesrat -lrb- upper house -rrb- should play a role concerning the nation 's fundamental issues . but the national parliaments ' strengthened role should by no means detract from the role of the european parliament .
in fact , the european and the respective national bodies compliment each other .
at the european level , the european parliament and the national legislative body should compliment each other .
the bundestag has the following role respective to the council of ministers : it controls the federal government in the council of ministers .
that is the right balance .
i have never understood the constitutional court 's reaction to the european parliament .
legal entity demands that european law comes before national law . currently , the parliament and the council are embroiled in a kind of power struggle concerning barroso .
you are in favor of barroso , but are n't you actually pleased that the parliament is not adhering to a given timetable but rather exerting its influence ?
we had that debate just a few days ago in stockholm with the swedish council president , prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , and i think that the election can take place in september .
with regard to the person , i am not only in favor of stabilizing and defending the european institutions - and that includes the commission – but i also believe that jose manuel barroso has done a good job over the past years .
he is the candidate for the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which constitutes the largest parliamentary group in the european parliament by far .
and so it makes sense for the epp to provide the president of the commission .
in germany and in other eu countries , there is an ongoing debate over the question of whether europe can or should move towards becoming a federal state .
what is your position on this ?
is this a goal ?
these abstract debates are not very helpful .
having a goal-oriented theoretical discussion quickly leads to confrontation .
europe must find its answers with regard to the constitutional form and the problems we face .
the european union is special , without a precedent anywhere else in the world , it is unique .
it is remarkable that 27 european peoples manage to formulate and pass common laws with the help of a joint parliament , the council of ministers , the european court of justice and the commission .
historically , what is totally new in europe , in the european union with its by now 500 million inhabitants , is that we work out differing points of view by means of legislation and political discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and national parliaments are meant to compliment each other that is why legislation is important , maintaining our legal entity . and that is why we must insist that european law comes before national law .
if national law were to have precedence , people would do as they please , every eu nation would pick and choose what is closest to its perceived national interest .
that is why it is so important to maintain legal entity , those are , if you like , the federal elements .
but i do not wish to have a theoretical discussion , rather to say that we must solve the problems we face .
look at the energy issue : just a few years ago , everyone would have said that is a national issue , whereas today , those who are responsible know that we have to solve this problem together .
a last question concerning jerzy buzek , who is to be elected as your successor : how significant is the fact that he is from poland , one of the new eu member states ?
as it were , he symbolizes that we all belong together now .
jerzy buzek will be the first top-level representative from the nations in central europe that have joined the eu .
that is a great step forward .
if , way back in 1979 when i became a member of the european parliament in the first european elections , someone had told me that we would reach the point where poland and other eastern european countries join the european union , and that in 2009 we would have a polish parliamentary president , i would have said , that is wonderful , like a dream come true . and now it is jerzy buzek , which is wonderful , we have been friends for many years , he is the successor i favored .
we think alike , and it is marvelous that he will be president of the european parliament .
i wish him much luck with this wonderful task .

but that 's not what 's happening in germany in an election year .
now , one minister has broken ranks and protested . german finance minister peer steinbrueck has criticized a change in government policy under which pensioners will never suffer cuts in their state pension in the future , even if wages fall .
steinbrueck has failed to win the support of his social democratic party for his criticism .
the new policy was adopted when it became clear that pensions would have to be cut as a result of the fall in average wages because of the economic crisis . steinbrueck says the change will be a burden for future generations .
but the leaders of both coalition partners , the christian democrats and the social democrats , have confirmed their support for the so-called pension guarantee .
steinbrueck not on his own bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck is known for speaking his mind however , steinbrueck , 62 , is winning support from younger politicians .
the head of the bavarian young christian democrats , stefan mueller , 34 , said that the burden of demographic change " should not be borne on the backs of the young . "
he had already won the support of the opposition and of employers ' organizations for his view . but he was seriously criticized by pensioners ' groups .
the likelihood that the pension guarantee will have to be called in is seen as small , since it looks as if wages will increase slightly this year and next .
smaller pensions in future meanwhile , the german pensions authority has issued figures which show that the pension eventually paid in future will be considerably lower than that paid out now . a 50 year old can expect a pension six percent lower than someone retiring now . and he 'll have to work until he 's 67 to get it , while the current pensioner can retire at 65. mll / ap / dpa / reuters / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the zew said its monthly index , based on a survey of almost 300 analysts , dropped to 39.5 points in july .
europe 's largest economy had been widely tipped to continue the climb it demonstrated in june , when it reached a three-year high of 44.8 points .
the figures posted by the zew index , which is closely watched by other european mood-gauging surveys , marked the first fall after eight consecutive rises .
but despite the surprise decline , the zew said the " surprisingly good numbers of incoming orders and industrial production " had had a positive influence on the 289 analysts and investors questioned for the survey .
zew president wolfgang franz said the figures confirmed the prognosis that germany 's economic development would fall by some six percent this year. tkw / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is the first time that the 61-year-old has testified in his war crimes trial . " it is very , very , very unfortunate that the prosecution 's disinformation , misinformation , lies and rumours would associate me with such titles , as a murderer or rapist , " charles taylor told the special court for sierra leone -lrb- scsl -rrb- .
the former president of liberia went on to outline his " very modest " background .
he said that as a young man he had cleaned floors and washed dishes to pay for his college fees in the united states .
in 1972 , taylor left for the us where he studied , among other subjects , accountancy , before his political ambition surfaced .
" seeing the need of our liberian people , i saw myself in the future as part of the government that would help our people , " taylor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many believe sierra leone 's diamonds were the reason for the civil war echoing his lawyers who addressed the international court on monday , taylor denied all eleven charges which include ordering the recruitment of child soldiers , rape , murder and torture during leone 's 1991-2001 civil wars . during this time , taylor is said to have armed , trained and controlled revolutionary united front -lrb- ruf -rrb- rebels and ordered them to mutilate thousands of civilians in his quest to secure control of sierra leone 's diamond mines .
gruesome evidence against taylor before wrapping up their case in february , prosecutors had already interviewed 91 witnesses , many of whom provided graphic testimony .
the witnesses provided disturbing details of atrocities carried out in sierra leone , including amputations , murder of children and cannibalism .
taylor 's testimony is expected to last several weeks .
he is the first of 249 witnesses that the defence will call to the stand .
taylor has been on trial in the hague since june 2007 at facilities provided by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- .
the court is headquartered in freetown , but the trial is taking place in the netherlands due to concerns it may trigger violence in sierra leone. wl / reuters / afp / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the country 's thriving german community along the eastern border is keen on belgian unity . tucked inside a pocket of countryside , among rolling hills and pastures , lies the town of eupen .
some 73,000 german-speakers live around here , people who are known as the " last belgians . " german is belgium 's third official language - about 56 percent of the population speaks flemish , 32 percent french , and just one percent german .
still , the people in the eupen region are more committed to the belgian state than their bickering flemish and french compatriots . isabelle weykmans , culture minister for belgium 's german-speaking community , said there 's a reason this community is so dedicated to the country . " they feel good here , and they have also seen that the belgian federal state gives us a great deal of autonomy in several policies , " weykmans said . a former battleground local public radio station brf broadcasts popular german music and the community has its own newspaper and its own schools .
it boasts 25 of its own members of parliament , as well as a guaranteed seat in the european parliament . but the community was not always as secure in its status as it is today . before the 19th century , the area served as a battleground for the french , british , prussians and austrians .
when europe 's maps were redrawn after napoleon 's defeat , the region was carved up in the grab for land .
the three separate german-speaking communities - around eupen , eifel and kelmis - were divided between prussia and the netherlands , and later belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's german-speakers have stickers identifying them as such , just so they 're not overlooked according to historian els herrebout at eupen 's state archives , the history of the region has been turbulent , especially during the period after world war one . " the end of the first world war was the beginning of a very difficult episode , " herrebout said .
" the population of the territory was forced - and no one asked them - to change nationality and homeland three times within 25 years . " the first time was under the treaty of versailles , when the community was forced to become belgian .
the second was during the hitler era , when the region was annexed to nazi germany .
the third came after the second world war , when the region was taken back by belgium . " that means : three times a change of language , three times assimilation attempts , and the resistance against it , the so-called revisionism between the two world wars , " herrebout said .
" there was a very important group that wanted to go back to germany . " that desire was more cultural than it was political , he said .
but politics did later play a divisive role , often tearing families apart , when informers and collaborators emerged . herrebout said the population was punished for siding with germany when it was finally returned to belgium after the war . " they lost their right to vote , nationality rights , some of them had to leave for germany , a lot of them were in prison after the war , " he said . some german speakers also lost their jobs , leaving bitterness which only began to heal after belgium started recognizing the community 's rights . not one german identity journalist chantal delhez at the local radio and tv station brf said that the german identity in the region is confused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isabelle weykmans , right , culture minister of belgium 's german-speaking community " it 's very difficult to say there is one identity because i think those people are still looking for their identity , " delhez said .
" there are so many cultural differences , so many cultural mixtures , there is not one identity . " but for culture minister weykmans , the community 's identity is stronger than ever . she said young people like her are staying in the area .
but their multilingual skills enable them to move or commute easily across the region 's three borders . " we do n't have enough jobs in our region and lots of people are going outside , so we are a very open community , " weykmans said .
" it 's very important for us , because we are living from this mix of different cultural influences . " the key then to this tiny community 's survival is multilingualism , an openness to the outside world and regional autonomy .
perhaps there is a lesson there for belgium 's flemish and french-speaking regions , which are intent on asserting their own cultural and linguistic identities . author : nina-maria potts -lrb- sac -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german government has to be capable of acting and negotiating in brussels , " langen told the muenchner merkur newspaper , adding that an imperative mandate for berlin would turn germany into the lame duck of the eu .
earlier this month csu chairman horst seehofer said he wanted both houses of the german parliament to have a greater say in eu matters affecting germany .
but cdu european member of parliament elmar brok said the demands are unrealistic .
" we have to secure the eu 's ability to act , " brok told ard television on tuesday .
he said it would be a poor deal if all the other member states did all the negotiating while germany was not involved .
constitutional court ruling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court ruling triggered the debate the current discord between the cdu and csu started when the constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled that germany would have to make some slight amendments to domestic laws before it could ratify the lisbon treaty .
chancellor merkel had been hoping to rush through the amendments , which relate to how much say berlin has in the formulation of eu decisions , with time to spare ahead of german elections in september .
but unless the csu backs away from its hardliner , that target could be hard to reach .
merkel is due to join the christian socialist convention on tuesday , where the focus is likely to be on the parties ' diverging views of germany 's role in brussels .
earlier , merkel told her executive committee that the cdu has been germany 's europe party since adenauer and kohl , and that that was a legacy which had to be continued .
fdp warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvana koch-mehrin has made the fdp position clear liberal european mp , silvana koch-mehrin has also rejected csu calls .
she told the muenchner merkur that although it was quite right to want to strengthen democratic and parliamentary rights , there were limits .
" anyone who , like the csu , is prepared to sacrifice the lisbon treaty as part of an election campaign tactic can not rely on the support of the free democrat party . "
germany , poland , ireland and the czech republic are the only countries that have not yet ratified the treaty. tkw / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the parade is one of the grand occasions in the french calendar and marks the storming of the bastille fortress in 1789 , traditionally seen as the start of the french revolution .
ceremoniously-dressed indian troops and german soldiers marched down the champs elysees along with some of france 's most modern military units while jets flew in formation overhead .

as part of the move , a german battalion will be deployed on french soil for the first time since invading german forces were forced out of france at the end of world war ii .

in germany , civil unions , for instance , have been permitted among same-sex couples since 2001 , but full marriages are not .
homosexual couples therefore do not enjoy the same rights as married heterosexual couples when it comes to taxes , retirement , civil servant benefits , or adoption law . for more on gay and lesbian rights and the community in germany , click on the links below , or listen to this week 's " living in germany " program to hear a more personal account of a homosexual civil union . author : louisa schaefer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lithuania 's parliament has approved a censorship bill that sharply curbs the spreading of public information that lawmakers say could harm the mental , physical , intellectual and moral development of youngsters . the bill bans 19 examples of " detrimental " information that supporting lawmakers consider harmful to the development of lithuania 's minors .
the bill prohibits any information that encourages homosexual , bi-sexual or polygamous relations .
it also bans information which " subverts family relations and degrades its values " .
this includes the distribution of images of heterosexual intercourse , death and severe injury .
the bill 's amendments , cover a broad range of other topics , including the paranormal , foul language and bad eating habits .
lithuania 's outgoing president valdas adamkus , who retired on sunday , had been highly critical of the bill and vetoed it in june .
under lithuania 's constitution , at least 71 votes were needed to override his veto , a threshold passed with ease .
on tuesday , 86 of the baltic state 's 141 lawmakers voted in favor of the bill , six were against .
adamkus 's successor , president dalia grybauskaite , can not re-impose a veto .
homosexuality is frowned upon by many in lithuania .
the vast majority of the population of 3.3 million is roman catholic .
the bill is passed , but what does it mean , exactly ?
the bill comes into law on march 2010 at the latest .
opponents see problems with it though , as it does not specifically define public dissemination nor set down the punishment for offenders .
they also argue the law is not only homophobic but will also impose broad censorship and violate lithuania 's commitments as a member of the united nations and the european union .
" parliament has demonstrated its will to institutionalise homophobia , " said vladimir simonko , head of the lithuanian gay league .
human rights group amnesty international had repeatedly urged vilnius not to approve the bill. wl / reuters / afp / ape editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" every four years , the group also produces an analysis of the threat facing the world 's rarest species . in april 2009 , co-author of the study jean-christophe vie delivered his hard-hitting verdict : the goal of the 2002 un convention to halt the extinction of endangered species by 2010 has not been reached . " the governments of the world should employ the same ambition in protecting nature that they use to protect the economic and financial sectors , " demanded vie .
but even climate change , which concerns the survival of our own species , occupies a place of secondary importance behind the current financial and economic crisis .
onagers , also known as asian wild asses , are most numerous on the plains of southern mongolia . illegal poaching has halved their numbers in the previous 16 years and they are now classified under the iucn 's red list as a " highly endangered " species . 1/10 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this could be a glowing example of a successful turnaround would it not be for the fact that human beings were also at risk from ddt . as long as " only " animal and plant life are in danger , the prospect of be able to protect the last remaining survivors of these species is doubtful . in the current economic climate , it looks as though banks and struggling corporations will continue to receive the greatest attention . author : michael gessat / andrew shale editor : kate bowen back to first page back 10/10 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i also regard it as a tribute to millions of citizens of our countries who did not bow to a hostile system , " buzek told the 736-member assembly in the french city of strasbourg .
" there is no you and us .
this is now our shared europe , " he said . in 2004 , the eu expanded to include 10 new member states .
three years later , two more were added , most of them from central and eastern europe . first eu parliament chief from eastern europe a former member of the solidarity trade union that ended communist rule in poland in 1989 , buzek is the first leader from eastern europe to head one of the eu 's three big institutions . buzek was prime minister of poland between 1997 and 2001 , when he presided over reforms to the country 's pensions , health sector , education system and public administration . those reforms were believed to have been unpopular among many voters , however buzek came through his term to become the first polish prime minister to serve a full term in the country 's post-communist era . it was during buzek 's years in office that poland joined nato , and under his leadership , poland moved closer to eventual membership of the european union , which it attained in 2004 .
buzek is widely considered a reconciliatory figure and not partial to power politics . on monday , buzek stressed that it was important for the parliament to gain the trust of the nearly 500 million europeans . " we have to realize we are in crisis now .
europeans are expecting a resolution of this problem .
and we also have to remember we should improve the work of the european parliament , " he said . long list of priorities buzek 's election came as no surprise , since he had the declared backing of the christian democrats , the socialists and the liberals who together hold 533 of the 736 seats in the parliament .

in the majority of cases , humans are primarily responsible for dwindling numbers .
through the destruction of the rainforests , agricultural practices , pollution , and climate change , we are transforming the world around us .
while the relationship between the hunter and the hunted is carefully regulated in nature , humans have proven incapable of preserving this fine balance and often drive their prey to near or total extinction . but even those animals above us in the food chain are not safe . there are estimated to be only 270 remaining sumatran tigers in the wild and these surviving animals are considered to be " threatened by extinction .

" this could be a glowing example of a successful turnaround would it not be for the fact that human beings were also at risk from ddt . as long as " only " animal and plant life are in danger , the prospect of be able to protect the last remaining survivors of these species is doubtful . in the current economic climate , it looks as though banks and struggling corporations will continue to receive the greatest attention . author : michael gessat / andrew shale editor : kate bowen back to first page back 10/10 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lithuania 's parliament has approved a censorship bill that sharply curbs the spreading of public information that lawmakers say could harm the mental , physical , intellectual and moral development of youngsters . the bill bans 19 examples of " detrimental " information that supporting lawmakers consider harmful to the development of lithuania 's minors .
the bill prohibits any information that encourages homosexual , bi-sexual or polygamous relations .
it also bans information which " subverts family relations and degrades its values " .
this includes the distribution of images of heterosexual intercourse , death and severe injury .
the bill 's amendments , cover a broad range of other topics , including the paranormal , foul language and bad eating habits .
lithuania 's outgoing president valdas adamkus , who retired on sunday , had been highly critical of the bill and vetoed it in june .
under lithuania 's constitution , at least 71 votes were needed to override his veto , a threshold passed with ease .
on tuesday , 86 of the baltic state 's 141 lawmakers voted in favor of the bill , six were against .
adamkus 's successor , president dalia grybauskaite , can not re-impose a veto .
homosexuality is frowned upon by many in lithuania .
the vast majority of the population of 3.3 million is roman catholic .
the bill is passed , but what does it mean , exactly ?
the bill comes into law on march 2010 at the latest .
opponents see problems with it though , as it does not specifically define public dissemination nor set down the punishment for offenders .
they also argue the law is not only homophobic but will also impose broad censorship and violate lithuania 's commitments as a member of the united nations and the european union .
" parliament has demonstrated its will to institutionalise homophobia , " said vladimir simonko , head of the lithuanian gay league .
human rights group amnesty international had repeatedly urged vilnius not to approve the bill. wl / reuters / afp / ape editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's enough to immunize 25 million people against the h1n1 swine flu - a person has to be injected twice in order for the vaccine to be effective .
together with current vaccine supplies against the h1n1 virus , the health ministers say they will have enough vaccines to provide protection for 30 percent of the german population .
the ministers will next develop a coordinated plan of action .
this includes drawing up a priority list of those eligible to receive h1n1 flu vaccine shots and making sure that insurance companies pay for the flu shots .
health workers , the aged , pregnant and chronically ill people are expected to be immunized first .

the zew said its monthly index , based on a survey of almost 300 analysts , dropped to 39.5 points in july .
europe 's largest economy had been widely tipped to continue the climb it demonstrated in june , when it reached a three-year high of 44.8 points .
the figures posted by the zew index , which is closely watched by other european mood-gauging surveys , marked the first fall after eight consecutive rises .
but despite the surprise decline , the zew said the " surprisingly good numbers of incoming orders and industrial production " had had a positive influence on the 289 analysts and investors questioned for the survey .
zew president wolfgang franz said the figures confirmed the prognosis that germany 's economic development would fall by some six percent this year. tkw / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her first stop will be a visit to the zackenberg research station in remote northeastern greenland .
zackenberg is an ecosystem research and monitoring facility , owned by the greenland home rule and operated by the national environmental research institute .
in the coming weeks , the “ ice blogger ” will also be visiting the interior ice sheet and the coastal glaciers , finding out first hand about the work of scientists monitoring climate change and its effects , the latest research results , and the implications both for the people of greenland and for the rest of the world .
“ greenland is a key area in the global climate process , ” says quaile .
“ the greenland ice sheet is the largest body of freshwater ice in the northern hemisphere .
in recent years it has become very clear that global warming is causing the ice sheet to lose mass . ”
quaile points out in her blog that increased melting and ice discharge would have major consequences for global sea levels , with the warming climate already having a considerable impact on the lifestyle of the people of greenland .
deutsche welle ’ s ice blog was born in 2008 when environment journalist quaile started to travel in the arctic as part of an international radio and online reporting network , with a project grant from the national science foundation to mark the international polar year .
in between trips , the ice blogger writes regularly on climate-related news and views , from the global political level to grassroots efforts to tackle global warming .

the authorities believe the businesses were being run through some 30 front men taking orders from high-profile camorra bosses who are already in prison .

he said the clan was still sitting on an illegal fortune , but that a sizeable chunk of it had been removed .

but the country 's thriving german community along the eastern border is keen on belgian unity . tucked inside a pocket of countryside , among rolling hills and pastures , lies the town of eupen .
some 73,000 german-speakers live around here , people who are known as the " last belgians . " german is belgium 's third official language - about 56 percent of the population speaks flemish , 32 percent french , and just one percent german .
still , the people in the eupen region are more committed to the belgian state than their bickering flemish and french compatriots . isabelle weykmans , culture minister for belgium 's german-speaking community , said there 's a reason this community is so dedicated to the country . " they feel good here , and they have also seen that the belgian federal state gives us a great deal of autonomy in several policies , " weykmans said . a former battleground local public radio station brf broadcasts popular german music and the community has its own newspaper and its own schools .
it boasts 25 of its own members of parliament , as well as a guaranteed seat in the european parliament . but the community was not always as secure in its status as it is today . before the 19th century , the area served as a battleground for the french , british , prussians and austrians .
when europe 's maps were redrawn after napoleon 's defeat , the region was carved up in the grab for land .
the three separate german-speaking communities - around eupen , eifel and kelmis - were divided between prussia and the netherlands , and later belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's german-speakers have stickers identifying them as such , just so they 're not overlooked according to historian els herrebout at eupen 's state archives , the history of the region has been turbulent , especially during the period after world war one . " the end of the first world war was the beginning of a very difficult episode , " herrebout said .
" the population of the territory was forced - and no one asked them - to change nationality and homeland three times within 25 years . " the first time was under the treaty of versailles , when the community was forced to become belgian .
the second was during the hitler era , when the region was annexed to nazi germany .
the third came after the second world war , when the region was taken back by belgium . " that means : three times a change of language , three times assimilation attempts , and the resistance against it , the so-called revisionism between the two world wars , " herrebout said .
" there was a very important group that wanted to go back to germany . " that desire was more cultural than it was political , he said .
but politics did later play a divisive role , often tearing families apart , when informers and collaborators emerged . herrebout said the population was punished for siding with germany when it was finally returned to belgium after the war . " they lost their right to vote , nationality rights , some of them had to leave for germany , a lot of them were in prison after the war , " he said . some german speakers also lost their jobs , leaving bitterness which only began to heal after belgium started recognizing the community 's rights . not one german identity journalist chantal delhez at the local radio and tv station brf said that the german identity in the region is confused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isabelle weykmans , right , culture minister of belgium 's german-speaking community " it 's very difficult to say there is one identity because i think those people are still looking for their identity , " delhez said .
" there are so many cultural differences , so many cultural mixtures , there is not one identity . " but for culture minister weykmans , the community 's identity is stronger than ever . she said young people like her are staying in the area .
but their multilingual skills enable them to move or commute easily across the region 's three borders . " we do n't have enough jobs in our region and lots of people are going outside , so we are a very open community , " weykmans said .
" it 's very important for us , because we are living from this mix of different cultural influences . " the key then to this tiny community 's survival is multilingualism , an openness to the outside world and regional autonomy .
perhaps there is a lesson there for belgium 's flemish and french-speaking regions , which are intent on asserting their own cultural and linguistic identities . author : nina-maria potts -lrb- sac -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

drew grant was killed near the huge freeport gold and copper mine , where he worked , in papua province on saturday .
autopsies have suggested evidence may have been altered , and police said that the bullets used were military issue .
the revelations have raised doubts about official accusations that the separatist rebels were to blame for this and two other fatal shootings .
a security guard was killed on sunday , and the body of a policeman found on monday , near the mine operated by an indonesian subsidiary of the us company freeport mcmoran , in the timika district of papua .
the timika commander of the free papua movement , kelly kwalik , told the jakarta globe newspaper that his fighters neither had the desire , nor the equipment , for the attacks .
yorris raweyai , a papuan lawmaker in the national parliament , dismissed claims that the separatist movement was responsible for the deaths .
" we know the opm -lsb- free papua movement -rsb- has been labelled as a troublemaker in papua for four decades .
but we also know that they have no guns and fight for their struggle peacefully , " he said .
' possible manipulation ' mr grant was shot dead by unknown attackers on saturday while he was travelling in a freeport vehicle at 5.30am in the morning .
freeport 's indonesian spokesman mindo pangaribuan said security had been tightened in the area after the incident , and that the mine 's operations have not been disturbed .
police have confirmed that high-powered weapons issued to military and police were used in the shooting .
analysts have noted that freeport is a lucrative posting for indonesian security forces - they are paid by the mining company and also earn large amounts of money by charging money to local illegal miners .
some analysts have suggested that the military could loosen its powerful grip on the region following the re-election of president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
abdul munim idris , the doctor who conducted the autopsy on mr grant 's body , said that fragments of bullets were found in the body , but no whole bullets .
asked whether there was any evidence the body had been manipulated , he said : " it 's possible , " the radio station reported .
mr grant 's body has now been returned to australia .
australian federal police are in indonesia assisting in the investigation of mr grant 's murder .
separatist sentiment in papua has been focused in recent years on calls for a referendum - similar to that held in east timor in 1999 - to allow papuans to decide if their resource-rich region should stay in indonesia .
the former dutch colony was absorbed into indonesia in 1969 after a vote by selected elders widely seen as flawed .
the weekend 's shooting were the first fatal killings of freeport employees since the killing of two american workers at the firm in 2002 .
the incident turned into a diplomatic row between indonesia and the us , and eventually a papuan separatist leader was convicted for the attack .

the weekend 's shooting were the first fatal killings of freeport employees since the killing of two american workers at the firm in 2002 .
the incident turned into a diplomatic row between indonesia and the us , and eventually a papuan separatist leader was convicted for the attack .

drew grant was killed near the huge freeport gold and copper mine , where he worked , in papua province on saturday .
autopsies have suggested evidence may have been altered , and police said that the bullets used were military issue .
the revelations have raised doubts about official accusations that the separatist rebels were to blame for this and two other fatal shootings .
a security guard was killed on sunday , and the body of a policeman found on monday , near the mine operated by an indonesian subsidiary of the us company freeport mcmoran , in the timika district of papua .

despite their thriving trade in many british immigrant communities , smokies are banned in the uk under ec law .
but the hybu cig cymru / meat promotion wales -lrb- hcc -rrb- report suggests they could be produced in approved abattoirs .
hcc 's gwyn howells said it was " in the interests of the welsh meat industry " to lobby the ec for a law change .
smokies are particularly popular among people from west africa and parts of asia , and with up to 240,000 west african immigrants living in cities across the uk , the market is potentially lucrative , the report said .
the research , for the food standards agency -lrb- fsa -rrb- , estimated that 155,000 cull ewe carcasses could be used for the new product every year .
the average retail value of skin-on sheep meat would be approximately £ 20 above the average retail price for a conventional mutton carcass , said the report .
this would amount to an extra £ 3.1m in income per year .
this is good news for the red meat sector gwyn howells , hcc chief executive farmers wanting to take advantage of the trade would have to avoid giving their sheep intramuscular or subcutaneous injections and shear them a fortnight prior to slaughter , the report noted .
the smaller to medium sized abattoirs likely to get involved would also have to invest in new equipment , estimated to cost approximately £ 75,000 per premises .
" this is good news for the red meat sector , " said mr howells , hcc chief executive .
" the report estimates that the additional income for farmers , processors and retailers if the production of skin-on meat is legalized will be in excess of £ 3m in wales alone .
" the livestock that is needed for this product will be older cull ewes , and represent a product that is in addition to our current output of premium quality welsh lamb .
" as a result , skin-on sheep meat is an entirely new product generating new income for everyone involved . "
' inspection and hygiene ' the report advised that the legalisation of the trade was still some way off , however .
in order for the law to be changed , the fsa would have to provide the european commission with detailed scientific evidence proving that it could be produced safely and hygienically in approved abattoirs .
" it 's too soon to speculate exactly when the fsa will be in a position to approach the ec to call for a change in current legislation , " said mr howells .
" but this report adds to the dossier of evidence being gathered by the fsa in favour of changing the law . "
mr howells said the fsa had already gathered evidence on meat inspection and hygiene .
a scientific report would then be sent to the fsa board before ministers were asked to formally approach the ec to change the law .
" the process of legalising the production of skin-on sheep meat is , however , likely to take a number of years , " said mr howells .
" from the demand side alone , it is without doubt in the interests of the welsh red meat industry to approach the ec to reconsider its position on the legalisation of this process . "

this is good news for the red meat sector gwyn howells , hcc chief executive farmers wanting to take advantage of the trade would have to avoid giving their sheep intramuscular or subcutaneous injections and shear them a fortnight prior to slaughter , the report noted .
the smaller to medium sized abattoirs likely to get involved would also have to invest in new equipment , estimated to cost approximately £ 75,000 per premises .
" this is good news for the red meat sector , " said mr howells , hcc chief executive .
" the report estimates that the additional income for farmers , processors and retailers if the production of skin-on meat is legalized will be in excess of £ 3m in wales alone .
" the livestock that is needed for this product will be older cull ewes , and represent a product that is in addition to our current output of premium quality welsh lamb .
" as a result , skin-on sheep meat is an entirely new product generating new income for everyone involved . "
' inspection and hygiene ' the report advised that the legalisation of the trade was still some way off , however .
in order for the law to be changed , the fsa would have to provide the european commission with detailed scientific evidence proving that it could be produced safely and hygienically in approved abattoirs .
" it 's too soon to speculate exactly when the fsa will be in a position to approach the ec to call for a change in current legislation , " said mr howells .
" but this report adds to the dossier of evidence being gathered by the fsa in favour of changing the law . "
mr howells said the fsa had already gathered evidence on meat inspection and hygiene .
a scientific report would then be sent to the fsa board before ministers were asked to formally approach the ec to change the law .
" the process of legalising the production of skin-on sheep meat is , however , likely to take a number of years , " said mr howells .
" from the demand side alone , it is without doubt in the interests of the welsh red meat industry to approach the ec to reconsider its position on the legalisation of this process . "

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- newsnight -pipe- oleg deripaska ' may quit britain ' bbc news / newsnight graphics version bbc sport home newsnight -pipe- newsnight scotland -pipe- 07:01 gmt , tuesday , 14 july 2009 08:01 uk oleg deripaska ' may quit britain ' by tim whewell bbc newsnight reporter russian billionaire oleg deripaska has told the bbc he is considering breaking his connection with britain .
" i 'm not sure i will have any links with britain in the future , " he said in an exclusive interview with newsnight .
the possible move follows the collapse of a birmingham-based van firm mr deripaska once owned .
last summer then eu trade commissioner lord mandelson and shadow chancellor george osborne were involved in controversy after a party on his yacht .
mr deripaska was speaking as he took me on a personally-guided tour of his russian industrial empire - the most extensive the publicity-shy tycoon has ever given a journalist .
one of russia 's richest men , mr deripaska still owns a house bought for an estimated £ 25m -lrb- $ 40m -rrb- on one of london 's most exclusive squares . "
i was n't considering in those days whether they were british politicians .
it was my summer holiday " oleg deripaska on the " yachtgate " scandal he said firmly that he still regards lord mandelson , now the business secretary , as his friend .
and he described their relationship as " good " , asking : " why should it have changed ? "
but he also told me : " i do n't understand your country .
" you have a lot of achievements , but at the moment you are in a kind of fire .
" you need to change so many things you inherited from the post-industrial economy - i just ca n't see any benefit in what the media are doing with your politicians right now . "
' a good dinner ' he is particularly annoyed at the reporting of the party last summer including lord mandelson and the shadow chancellor , mr osborne , when his 72-metre yacht , the queen k , was moored off corfu .
mr deripaska said : " i was n't considering in those days whether they were british politicians .
it was my summer holiday . "
" we had a good dinner , there were many people and i 'm surprised they picked on these poor guys and screwed them in the press , " he added .
the scandal erupted because mr deripaska controls most of russia 's aluminium - and lord mandelson then oversaw eu metal tariffs .
i asked mr deripaska if he ever benefited from their relationship .
" benefited from friendship ? " he asked indignantly .
" it 's not my business .
whatever i did in my life , i did myself . "
lord mandelson has already denied he did " any favours " for mr deripaska - and the eu commission has said a 2005 decision to remove punitive import tariffs on aluminium foil , that appeared to benefit mr deripaska 's company rusal , was taken without lord mandelson 's personal intervention .
after the meeting in corfu , george osborne was accused by mr deripaska 's friend - the banker nathaniel rothschild , who was at also at the party , of having used the occasion to solicit a donation to the conservative party - a claim he has strongly denied .
disappointment with britain speaking about the allegations for the first time , mr deripaska said : " i tried to stay away from russian politicians - why should i move towards british politicians ?
" i ca n't see that anyone from britain would ask me - it 's unbelievable . "

watch tim whewell 's interview with oleg deripaska russian billionaire oleg deripaska has told the bbc he is considering breaking his connection with britain .
" i 'm not sure i will have any links with britain in the future , " he said in an exclusive interview with newsnight .
the possible move follows the collapse of a birmingham-based van firm mr deripaska once owned .
last summer then eu trade commissioner lord mandelson and shadow chancellor george osborne were involved in controversy after a party on his yacht .
mr deripaska was speaking as he took me on a personally-guided tour of his russian industrial empire - the most extensive the publicity-shy tycoon has ever given a journalist .
one of russia 's richest men , mr deripaska still owns a house bought for an estimated £ 25m -lrb- $ 40m -rrb- on one of london 's most exclusive squares .
i was n't considering in those days whether they were british politicians .
it was my summer holiday oleg deripaska on the " yachtgate " scandal he said firmly that he still regards lord mandelson , now the business secretary , as his friend .
and he described their relationship as " good " , asking : " why should it have changed ? "
but he also told me : " i do n't understand your country .
" you have a lot of achievements , but at the moment you are in a kind of fire .
" you need to change so many things you inherited from the post-industrial economy - i just ca n't see any benefit in what the media are doing with your politicians right now . "
' a good dinner ' he is particularly annoyed at the reporting of the party last summer including lord mandelson and the shadow chancellor , mr osborne , when his 72-metre yacht , the queen k , was moored off corfu .
mr deripaska said : " i was n't considering in those days whether they were british politicians .
it was my summer holiday . "
the queen k was the unlikely setting for a meeting that rocked politics " we had a good dinner , there were many people and i 'm surprised they picked on these poor guys and screwed them in the press , " he added .
the scandal erupted because mr deripaska controls most of russia 's aluminium - and lord mandelson then oversaw eu metal tariffs .
i asked mr deripaska if he ever benefited from their relationship .
" benefited from friendship ? " he asked indignantly .
" it 's not my business .
whatever i did in my life , i did myself . "
lord mandelson has already denied he did " any favours " for mr deripaska - and the eu commission has said a 2005 decision to remove punitive import tariffs on aluminium foil , that appeared to benefit mr deripaska 's company rusal , was taken without lord mandelson 's personal intervention .
after the meeting in corfu , george osborne was accused by mr deripaska 's friend - the banker nathaniel rothschild , who was at also at the party , of having used the occasion to solicit a donation to the conservative party - a claim he has strongly denied .
disappointment with britain speaking about the allegations for the first time , mr deripaska said : " i tried to stay away from russian politicians - why should i move towards british politicians ?
" i ca n't see that anyone from britain would ask me - it 's unbelievable . "
george osborne and peter mandelson were left at daggers drawn he says he has not been in britain for more than a year and does not currently hold a british visa .
his disappointment with the country is fuelled partly by the failure to save ldv , the british van-maker he owned , from bankruptcy .
