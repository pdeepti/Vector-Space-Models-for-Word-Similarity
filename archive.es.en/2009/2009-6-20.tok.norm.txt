the ministry 's provisional figures indicate almost a doubling of new borrowings next year to 86 billion euros , compared to the 47.6 billion euros adopted on friday in a supplementary budget for 2009 .
new borrowings , to plug the gap between public expenditure versus revenues , are already at a post-war record .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes " illusory " , says finance minister steinbrueck in the bundestag parliament , finance minister peer steinbrueck said the sharp recession and stimulus packages recently enacted by chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government , had led inevitably to a combination of falling tax revenues and higher borrowings .
calls by some to lower taxes were " illusory " , he added .
ahead of germany 's federal election in september , several opposition parties slammed the latest projections .
liberal free democrat party spokesman jürgen koppelin said germany was financially worse off than at the beginning of merkel 's coalition in 2005 - despite efforts in recent years to consolidate budgets . koppelin demanded a cash audit straight after the election and rigorous re-examination of all expenditures .
the greens ' budgetary expert alexander bonde said the projected 86 billion euro gap in projected new borrowings was a " fatal " development .
by 2013 , he added , total government debt would be much higher .
ministry projections to be presented to merkel 's cabinet next week show new state borrowings for 2011 of 71 billion euros and 59 billion euros in 2012 .
total federal public expenditure next year is set to rise by eight percent to 328 billion euros but then decline somewhat by 2013 to 313 billion euros .
next year 's biggest spender will be the federal ministry of labour and social affairs , representing half of the overall budget .
its spending includes funding for germany 's 3.5 million unemployed and 1.2 million workers on so-called kurzarbeit , subsidised shortened working hours .
the european commission , which monitors the deficits of european union countries , has forecast that many member nations will breach budgetary limits in 2009 and 2010 .
under the eu 's stability and growth pact , eurozone governments are not supposed to run up deficits beyond three percent of each country 's gross domestic product or gdp .
last wednesday , steinbrueck said german public debt this year would probably reach 4.4 percent of gdp. ipj / reuters / afp / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.06.2009 germany 's public debt heading for new record levels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is facing a surge in new state borrowings provisional data from germany 's finance ministry projects new record levels of public debt over the next five years as berlin tackles the recession with economic stimulus measures . germany 's finance ministry has warned of a " dramatic increase " in public debt in germany over the next five years because of the global economic crisis and government responses .
the ministry 's provisional figures indicate almost a doubling of new borrowings next year to 86 billion euros , compared to the 47.6 billion euros adopted on friday in a supplementary budget for 2009 .
new borrowings , to plug the gap between public expenditure versus revenues , are already at a post-war record .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes " illusory " , says finance minister steinbrueck in the bundestag parliament , finance minister peer steinbrueck said the sharp recession and stimulus packages recently enacted by chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government , had led inevitably to a combination of falling tax revenues and higher borrowings .
calls by some to lower taxes were " illusory " , he added .
ahead of germany 's federal election in september , several opposition parties slammed the latest projections .
liberal free democrat party spokesman jürgen koppelin said germany was financially worse off than at the beginning of merkel 's coalition in 2005 - despite efforts in recent years to consolidate budgets . koppelin demanded a cash audit straight after the election and rigorous re-examination of all expenditures .
the greens ' budgetary expert alexander bonde said the projected 86 billion euro gap in projected new borrowings was a " fatal " development .
by 2013 , he added , total government debt would be much higher .
ministry projections to be presented to merkel 's cabinet next week show new state borrowings for 2011 of 71 billion euros and 59 billion euros in 2012 .
total federal public expenditure next year is set to rise by eight percent to 328 billion euros but then decline somewhat by 2013 to 313 billion euros .
next year 's biggest spender will be the federal ministry of labour and social affairs , representing half of the overall budget .
its spending includes funding for germany 's 3.5 million unemployed and 1.2 million workers on so-called kurzarbeit , subsidised shortened working hours .
the european commission , which monitors the deficits of european union countries , has forecast that many member nations will breach budgetary limits in 2009 and 2010 .
under the eu 's stability and growth pact , eurozone governments are not supposed to run up deficits beyond three percent of each country 's gross domestic product or gdp .
last wednesday , steinbrueck said german public debt this year would probably reach 4.4 percent of gdp. ipj / reuters / afp / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

near enqelab square in the center of the iranian capital massed security forces had responded with force , using teargas and batons , to disperse several thousand protestors - fewer than the hundreds of thousands who had gathered earlier in the week .
but at nightfall rooftop protests with cries of allahu akbar -lrb- god is greatest -rrb- were heard for hours - reportedly from supporters of the moderate opposition leader mirhossein mousavi - in what observers say is an echo of tactics used in the 1979 islamic revolution against the-then shah .
mousavi and another ostensibly defeated candidate mehdi karoubi had not summoned their followers onto the streets .
apparent bombing at mausoleum police appeared to confirm reports that a suicide bomber had detonated his device at the mausoleum of the father of iran 's islamic revolution , the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini .
a television channel , press tv , said the bomber was killed and three others were wounded .
another witness , quoted by reuters , said supporters of mousavi had set fire to a building in southern tehran , reportedly used by basij , a paramiltiary force of the government of president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
three busloads of basij islamic militia and trucks carrying motorcycles used by the paramilitaries were sighted heading for the capital .

there were no confirmations of casualties .

he cited what he called a " huge volume of cheating and changing of votes , " asserting this had been " planned in advance , " and said the ballots should be examined by a " reliable committee . "
he added that he and his supporters were not against the islamic system but just wanted to reform it by " peaceful means . "
witnesses said he also called for a national strike if he was arrested .
since last week scores of reformists have been detained and authorities have cracked down on foreign and domestic media .
at friday prayers , khamenei had ruled out any electoral fraud , saying ahmadinejad had been re-elected by a margin of 11 million votes , and warned protestors of repercussions .
on saturday iran 's powerful 12-man guardian council said it was ready for a random recount of 10 percent of the ballot boxes in response to complaints by mousavi and two other candidates .
the council had invited mousavi , another candidate mehdi karoubi and a third hopeful to a special meeting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de television -pipe- 20.06.2009 teen wins " i can be chancellor " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finalists -lrb- left to right -rrb- nuray karaca placed third , the winner jacob schrot and in second place , philip klaisch a teenager running on a platform of political cooperation won a new german political reality show . an 18-year old from brandenburg has won the german reality show " ich kann kanzler " -lrb- i can be chancellor -rrb- . german public broadcaster zdf bargained that it could get young people more interested in politics by using a popular show format with some new subject matter .
friday evening , six candidates went head-to-head on the issues on live television from the bundestag in bonn , where previous chancellors held sway for 40 years .
in the end , the winner with the clear majority of 72.6 percent was jacob schrot . around 180,000 people participated in the vote according to zdf .
schrot is a member of the youth group of the christian democratic union or cdu , who ran on the slogan " recognize the strength of pluralism . "
among schrot 's other platform issues were his demands for more nuclear power for germany and more cooperation and less political bickering .
on the zdf web site , one can still watch the videos submitted by six finalists , who lay out their political agendas .
most of the videos are simple and grainy , and appear to have been shot almost spontaneously in a family basement .
but some did go a bit further .
one candidate , philip kalisch , 31 , who came in second place , got a friend to film him on his balcony , and is styled like a long lost member of the popular rock band kings of leon .
television 's allure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three judges weighed the candidates but the winner was chosen by viewers zdf is betting that the youth of germany might well warm to politics if it gets them on a tv casting show .
some 2,500 people between the ages of 18 and 35 submitted videos through the network 's web site .
that 's a far cry from the 30,000 who tried out for the last season of " deutschland sucht den superstar " - germany 's version of pop idol - or the mob scene that ensued in duesseldorf earlier this year when heidi klum held an open casting for " germany 's next top model . "
but producers said they thought the turnout for kanzler was good , considering it 's a show that nobody has ever seen .
from that pool of 2,500 applicants , 40 were selected to come to bonn .
there , each one made a brief speech in the old bundestag .
sizing them up was a panel of judges made up of a politician , a tv talk show host who 's interviewed quite a few politicians , and a comedy actress with experience in sending them up .
grooming candidates early the show is not really meant to find the country a future head of government .
but the exposure gained on the show , some believe , might well catapult the contestants into public roles within their chosen parties that could lead to much more in the future .
" among the 40 that we had at the audition ; " the host of the show steffen seibert said , " there were definitely at least 10 that i could see , 10 or 15 years from now , in leading positions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists gave speeches on live television from the old bundestag for the most part , however , said the politician on the panel , the former premier of the german city-state of bremen , henning scherf , the show is an attempt to make politics an exciting topic - or even a career choice - among young people .
" i hope it will embolden smart , young , engaged people to participate in the political process .
they have to have role models , and they have to have incentives , " said scherf .
" we have to strive to make sure they are convinced it 's worth their while , and arouse their curiosity - not just preach to them . "
the push to get young people involved is stepping into high gear , as germany prepares to vote for a new government on september 27 .
canadian import the show is patterned after the cbc program " canada 's next great prime minister . "
it grew up out of an essay contest , made it to the network three years ago , and ended up as a surprise hit .
for the latest edition , the fourth on the cbc , the network even lured alex trebek , superstar host of the american game show " jeopardy ! " to come back to his native canada to present the program .
the show also has some even bigger names on its panel of judges : former prime ministers brian mulroney , kim campbell , joe clark and paul martin .
the cbc has been selling the concept around the world and germany 's version is set to be followed by others in australia and britain. mrh / sjt / dpa / kna editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the foundation was set up after the auschwitz museum made clear it was short of funds and called on the international community for help .
tens of thousands of people visit the site of the auschwitz birkenau camp each year to find out more about the nazi killing machine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first impression for victims and vistors alike a very moving experience visitors take a several kilometer long walk down a vast empty field from the railway platform .
the victims were unloaded from trains there and sent to what remains of the wooden barracks and various crematoria where they were put to death .
in auschwitz they also have a chance to listen to audio and video accounts by survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many children died in nazi death camps like auschwitz critics have long said that the auschwitz museum should do more to preserve the remaining buildings and camp installations outside the main exhibition area .
many visitors have pointed out that the barracks are in a dilapidated state and unless something is done soon , few structures will be left standing .
the polish government has argued , however , that since auschwitz birkenau is an international memorial site , the international community should contribute to the cost of maintaining the site .
so far , poland has covered most of the expenses .
a duty to remember at a meeting in warsaw , a newly formed auschwitz-birkenau foundation has now been inaugurated .
its founder , former polish foreign minister wladyslaw bartoszewski , himself a one-time auschwitz inmate , has called on the world to help pay for the conservation of 155 buildings and some 100,000 objects on the site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people today visit auschwitz as part of their history lessons " i was an auschwitz inmate at the age of 18 , " he said .
" i 'm now 88 .
i often wonder if anything will be left after us , or will there be nothing ? "
" auschwitz is a testimonial , " bartoszewski stresses .
" for millions of people whose family and friends were wiped out in the camp , auschwitz is a symbol for mankind , part of european history , and not only polish or jewish heritage . "
bartoszewski has appealed to europe for help .
german representatives are included in the council of the auschwitz birkenau foundation .
the premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia , jurgen ruettgers , who is a member of the council , told the meeting that the camp must be preserved for future generations .
germany has pledged one million euros to the foundation .
other contributions are expected from france , italy , britain and the czech republic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de television -pipe- 20.06.2009 teen wins " i can be chancellor " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finalists -lrb- left to right -rrb- nuray karaca placed third , the winner jacob schrot and in second place , philip klaisch a teenager running on a platform of political cooperation won a new german political reality show . an 18-year old from brandenburg has won the german reality show " ich kann kanzler " -lrb- i can be chancellor -rrb- . german public broadcaster zdf bargained that it could get young people more interested in politics by using a popular show format with some new subject matter .
friday evening , six candidates went head-to-head on the issues on live television from the bundestag in bonn , where previous chancellors held sway for 40 years .
in the end , the winner with the clear majority of 72.6 percent was jacob schrot . around 180,000 people participated in the vote according to zdf .
schrot is a member of the youth group of the christian democratic union or cdu , who ran on the slogan " recognize the strength of pluralism . "
among schrot 's other platform issues were his demands for more nuclear power for germany and more cooperation and less political bickering .
on the zdf web site , one can still watch the videos submitted by six finalists , who lay out their political agendas .
most of the videos are simple and grainy , and appear to have been shot almost spontaneously in a family basement .
but some did go a bit further .
one candidate , philip kalisch , 31 , who came in second place , got a friend to film him on his balcony , and is styled like a long lost member of the popular rock band kings of leon .
television 's allure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three judges weighed the candidates but the winner was chosen by viewers zdf is betting that the youth of germany might well warm to politics if it gets them on a tv casting show .
some 2,500 people between the ages of 18 and 35 submitted videos through the network 's web site .
that 's a far cry from the 30,000 who tried out for the last season of " deutschland sucht den superstar " - germany 's version of pop idol - or the mob scene that ensued in duesseldorf earlier this year when heidi klum held an open casting for " germany 's next top model . "
but producers said they thought the turnout for kanzler was good , considering it 's a show that nobody has ever seen .
from that pool of 2,500 applicants , 40 were selected to come to bonn .
there , each one made a brief speech in the old bundestag .
sizing them up was a panel of judges made up of a politician , a tv talk show host who 's interviewed quite a few politicians , and a comedy actress with experience in sending them up .
grooming candidates early the show is not really meant to find the country a future head of government .
but the exposure gained on the show , some believe , might well catapult the contestants into public roles within their chosen parties that could lead to much more in the future .
" among the 40 that we had at the audition ; " the host of the show steffen seibert said , " there were definitely at least 10 that i could see , 10 or 15 years from now , in leading positions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists gave speeches on live television from the old bundestag for the most part , however , said the politician on the panel , the former premier of the german city-state of bremen , henning scherf , the show is an attempt to make politics an exciting topic - or even a career choice - among young people .
" i hope it will embolden smart , young , engaged people to participate in the political process .
they have to have role models , and they have to have incentives , " said scherf .
" we have to strive to make sure they are convinced it 's worth their while , and arouse their curiosity - not just preach to them . "
the push to get young people involved is stepping into high gear , as germany prepares to vote for a new government on september 27 .
canadian import the show is patterned after the cbc program " canada 's next great prime minister . "
it grew up out of an essay contest , made it to the network three years ago , and ended up as a surprise hit .
for the latest edition , the fourth on the cbc , the network even lured alex trebek , superstar host of the american game show " jeopardy ! " to come back to his native canada to present the program .
the show also has some even bigger names on its panel of judges : former prime ministers brian mulroney , kim campbell , joe clark and paul martin .
the cbc has been selling the concept around the world and germany 's version is set to be followed by others in australia and britain. mrh / sjt / dpa / kna editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us defense officials confirmed that the ship was being monitored and said that the north korean ship was one of a group of vessels previously linked to illicit missile-related cargo .
defense sources have yet to indicate if , or when , they might ask to search the vessel under the un security council resolution , which bans shipments of arms and nuclear or missile technology to and from north korea .
the north koreans are expected to reject any such request .
but at some point , the ship will likely need to stop for refueling along the chinese coast or elsewhere , officials said .
at that point , the country where the ship enters port is obliged under the un resolution to search the vessel if there are grounds for suspicion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us navy ships are patrolling for resolution-busting vessels pentagon officials declined to comment on a television report that the navy destroyer was heading to intercept the north korean vessel .
the officials stressed that the un sanctions do not authorize military force and that washington was pursuing a diplomatic strategy .
tensions on the korean peninsula have been running high since pyongyang carried out its second nuclear test last month .
after the underground test and subsequent missile launches , the un security council adopted a resolution last week that includes financial sanctions designed to choke off revenue to the regime .
hawaii on alert in other developments , the us military has moved to beef up missile defenses in hawaii over fears pyongyang may launch a rocket over the pacific .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us missile batteries are on alert on the island of hawaii us defense secretary robert gates , citing concerns that north korea might launch a missile towards hawaii , said thursday he had approved the deployment of thaad missile defense weaponry to the pacific island chain as a precaution .
however , us military officials say they have no indication that north korean missile technology has improved markedly since past failed launches , and military and other assessments suggest the communist nation probably could not hit the westernmost us state if it tried .
the north 's taepodong-2 could travel that far in theory , if it works as designed .
but three test launches have either failed or do not demonstrate anything close to that range .
nonetheless , past failure should not be considered a predictor , one military official said , and the seaborne radar and land-based interceptors were added this week as a prudent backstop .
us , china set for talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong il has been ratcheting up the pressure meanwhile , the us urged china on friday to support international pressure on north korea in talks next week .
the pentagon officials will also ask china to agree to more contacts between the countries ' armed forces in hopes of building a more open dialogue and reducing tensions .
the us-china talks will be the latest in a flurry of international discussions which most recently included the meeting of european leaders to discuss north korea , the un resolution and increasing eu sanctions on friday .
eu agrees on fresh sanctions in a statement , the council of eu heads of state and government " insists on the importance of a swift and efficient implementation of all these measures " adopted by the un security council last week .
the fresh sanctions include a ban on shipments of arms and nuclear and missile technology to and from north korea .
the eu summit statement , issued after two days of talks between european leaders , condemned the recent nuclear and ballistic missile tests in the isolated communist state .

us defense officials confirmed that the ship was being monitored and said that the north korean ship was one of a group of vessels previously linked to illicit missile-related cargo .
defense sources have yet to indicate if , or when , they might ask to search the vessel under the un security council resolution , which bans shipments of arms and nuclear or missile technology to and from north korea .
the north koreans are expected to reject any such request .
but at some point , the ship will likely need to stop for refueling along the chinese coast or elsewhere , officials said .
at that point , the country where the ship enters port is obliged under the un resolution to search the vessel if there are grounds for suspicion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us navy ships are patrolling for resolution-busting vessels pentagon officials declined to comment on a television report that the navy destroyer was heading to intercept the north korean vessel .
the officials stressed that the un sanctions do not authorize military force and that washington was pursuing a diplomatic strategy .
tensions on the korean peninsula have been running high since pyongyang carried out its second nuclear test last month .
after the underground test and subsequent missile launches , the un security council adopted a resolution last week that includes financial sanctions designed to choke off revenue to the regime .
hawaii on alert in other developments , the us military has moved to beef up missile defenses in hawaii over fears pyongyang may launch a rocket over the pacific .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us missile batteries are on alert on the island of hawaii us defense secretary robert gates , citing concerns that north korea might launch a missile towards hawaii , said thursday he had approved the deployment of thaad missile defense weaponry to the pacific island chain as a precaution .
however , us military officials say they have no indication that north korean missile technology has improved markedly since past failed launches , and military and other assessments suggest the communist nation probably could not hit the westernmost us state if it tried .
the north 's taepodong-2 could travel that far in theory , if it works as designed .
but three test launches have either failed or do not demonstrate anything close to that range .
nonetheless , past failure should not be considered a predictor , one military official said , and the seaborne radar and land-based interceptors were added this week as a prudent backstop .
us , china set for talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong il has been ratcheting up the pressure meanwhile , the us urged china on friday to support international pressure on north korea in talks next week .
the pentagon officials will also ask china to agree to more contacts between the countries ' armed forces in hopes of building a more open dialogue and reducing tensions .
the us-china talks will be the latest in a flurry of international discussions which most recently included the meeting of european leaders to discuss north korea , the un resolution and increasing eu sanctions on friday .
eu agrees on fresh sanctions in a statement , the council of eu heads of state and government " insists on the importance of a swift and efficient implementation of all these measures " adopted by the un security council last week .
the fresh sanctions include a ban on shipments of arms and nuclear and missile technology to and from north korea .
the eu summit statement , issued after two days of talks between european leaders , condemned the recent nuclear and ballistic missile tests in the isolated communist state .

congress also assuaged the fears of foreign carmakers that the program would only apply to american-made cars .
the bill passed by congress contains no such restrictions , and means a toyota made in tokyo could be traded for a chrysler made in detroit , and vice-versa , a congressional staffer confirmed .
stefan jacoby , volkswagen of america 's president and chief executive , called the vote “ historic ” and in a statement urged us shoppers to put volkswagen 's “ fun-to-drive , fuel-efficient vehicles ” on their “ shopping list . ”

near enqelab square in the center of the iranian capital massed security forces had responded with force , using teargas and batons , to disperse several thousand protestors - fewer than the hundreds of thousands who had gathered earlier in the week .
but at nightfall rooftop protests with cries of allahu akbar -lrb- god is greatest -rrb- were heard for hours - reportedly from supporters of the moderate opposition leader mirhossein mousavi - in what observers say is an echo of tactics used in the 1979 islamic revolution against the-then shah .
mousavi and another ostensibly defeated candidate mehdi karoubi had not summoned their followers onto the streets .
apparent bombing at mausoleum police appeared to confirm reports that a suicide bomber had detonated his device at the mausoleum of the father of iran 's islamic revolution , the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini .
a television channel , press tv , said the bomber was killed and three others were wounded .
another witness , quoted by reuters , said supporters of mousavi had set fire to a building in southern tehran , reportedly used by basij , a paramiltiary force of the government of president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
three busloads of basij islamic militia and trucks carrying motorcycles used by the paramilitaries were sighted heading for the capital .
unverified footage on the internet showed crowds running away from police lines , several apparently wounded persons and burning vehicles .
riot police reportedly fired shots into the air .
there were no confirmations of casualties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad and rival candidate hossein mousavi opposition candidate mousavi calls for election re-run mousavi in a newsletter posted on a website continued to defy ruling ayatollah ali khamenei .
mousavi reiterated demands for annulment of the june 12 election .
he cited what he called a " huge volume of cheating and changing of votes , " asserting this had been " planned in advance , " and said the ballots should be examined by a " reliable committee . "
he added that he and his supporters were not against the islamic system but just wanted to reform it by " peaceful means . "
witnesses said he also called for a national strike if he was arrested .
since last week scores of reformists have been detained and authorities have cracked down on foreign and domestic media .
at friday prayers , khamenei had ruled out any electoral fraud , saying ahmadinejad had been re-elected by a margin of 11 million votes , and warned protestors of repercussions .
on saturday iran 's powerful 12-man guardian council said it was ready for a random recount of 10 percent of the ballot boxes in response to complaints by mousavi and two other candidates .
the council had invited mousavi , another candidate mehdi karoubi and a third hopeful to a special meeting .
a council spokesman said only the conservative mohsen rezaie , who is a former revolutionary guard , had attended that meeting .
obama tells iranian government , world is watching united states president barack obama called on iran 's government to " stop all violent and unjust actions against its own people . "
" the iranian government must understand that the world is watching , " obama said .
the united states stood with all those who sought to exercise " universal rights to assembly and free speech , " he added .
despite assurances by obama administration officials that washington did not favour interference in iran , on friday both houses of the us congress voted to condemn violence by iran 's government against demonstrators. ipj / dpa / reuters / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 20.06.2009 switch from oil to biomass wo n't happen overnight , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enthusiasm for biomass is high right now dw talked to franz fischler , the eu 's commissioner for agriculture from 1999 to 2004 , about the biomass boom and whether it 's a way out of the global energy crisis . deutsche welle : biomass is considered to be an important building block for securing future energy supplies .
how would you assess the potential there for europe and the rest of the world ? franz fischler : i think that biomass should n't only be seen as the raw material for energy supply , but more broadly as a renewable material .
it can , for example , replace metals or other raw materials - not just oil or gas .
the potential is fairly large , but is also limited .
no one should think that we can just switch from an oil-based to a biomass-based economy right now . the potential is particularly limited when we 're dealing with fuel - also because there 's one thing that can not be questioned : that feeding the world has to have a higher priority than producing or using biomass for energy purposes . five percent of food resources globally are used in the production of biofuels .
at the same time , millions of people are starving .
is it reasonable to use agricultural land for the production of biomass and biofuels ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz fischler i think that you ca n't give a generalized answer to that .
there are situations in which production of energy crops could definitely make sense .
but as i said , these are not all that relevant .
the eu 's goal of meeting 10 percent of fuel consumption with biomass depends on second-generation biofuel - in other words , when bioethanol is no longer made from grain but from straw . heat , electricity and fuel can be produced with biomass .
what use do you feel is most promising ? i 'm an advocate of what 's known as " cascade utilization " of biomass .
in my opinion , biomass is much too valuable to just burn it or make biogas out of .
i think that the various components that biomass is made from have to be used separately .
and you ca n't forget that biomass offers a reservoir of chemicals that first have to be removed .
the next step is then to make fuel from the cellulose - that is , the straw or grass - but a lot more research is necessary .
only what 's left over should be burned .
the same is true for wood . how do you feel about the balance between food production and energy production ? i feel that without a doubt , food production needs to take priority .
but we should n't forget that there are also grain and other biomass products ill-suited to human consumption that we can use with a clear ethical conscience . should there be international or eu regulation ? the eu will have to revise its targets according to how successfully second-generation biofuels are adopted .
one thing is clear : the 10-percent target wo n't be reached with first-generation biofuels . what does production of biomass mean for rural areas and ultimately , developing countries ? if you consider biomass in a broader context and not only in the context of its use as fuel , then it is apparent that it provides ample opportunities for provision of decentralized energy .
the guessing region in austria , for example , is autonomous in its energy production .
in this case , fuel provision plays a minor role .
the focus is on using wood waste and straw as energy and producing various chemicals from biomass . it 's still early days for modern bioenergy use .
are the conditions for sensible use of bioenergy and research in the area helping maximize its potential and leading to its sustainability ? there is intensive research going on and these questions are the focus of the eu 's current research program , but we are still a long way from reaching our targets .
liquefaction of biogas and the use of straw and wood waste and cellulose , for example , are still far from viable options .
the challenge is not only one of technology but also of environmental relevance . what role does the eu play in the development of these technologies ? on the one hand , the eu funds research and development , although only in response to applications - it does n't commission r & d. on the other hand , it funds investments in production , especially in the area of rural development .
what it does n't do is directly subsidize production .
it used to , but stopped because of the " health checks . "
the concept of obligatory land set aside was also done away with .
the eu has turned away from its policy of larger subsidies for grain for energy production than grain for food production . in march 2009 , the eu drew up sustainability criteria for use of biomass .
can you tell us what they are ? these are still only draft criteria , based on the principle that standards need to be introduced to determine what kind of greenhouse gas savings should be achieved by sustainable biomass .
there are diverging opinions on what the lowest level of carbon emissions should be .
for biofuels , the european commission 's requirement was for a 30-percent savings , but a 50-percent savings appears to be a more likely target . how important will biomass be by the mid-21st century ? a lot more important than it is now .
the more innovation we see , the more important it will become . franz fischler is the chairman of the eco-social forum austria for the development of bioenergy . interview : gero reuter -lrb- jp -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

how would you assess the potential there for europe and the rest of the world ? franz fischler : i think that biomass should n't only be seen as the raw material for energy supply , but more broadly as a renewable material .
it can , for example , replace metals or other raw materials - not just oil or gas .
the potential is fairly large , but is also limited .
no one should think that we can just switch from an oil-based to a biomass-based economy right now . the potential is particularly limited when we 're dealing with fuel - also because there 's one thing that can not be questioned : that feeding the world has to have a higher priority than producing or using biomass for energy purposes . five percent of food resources globally are used in the production of biofuels .
at the same time , millions of people are starving .
is it reasonable to use agricultural land for the production of biomass and biofuels ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz fischler i think that you ca n't give a generalized answer to that .
there are situations in which production of energy crops could definitely make sense .
but as i said , these are not all that relevant .
the eu 's goal of meeting 10 percent of fuel consumption with biomass depends on second-generation biofuel - in other words , when bioethanol is no longer made from grain but from straw . heat , electricity and fuel can be produced with biomass .
what use do you feel is most promising ? i 'm an advocate of what 's known as " cascade utilization " of biomass .
in my opinion , biomass is much too valuable to just burn it or make biogas out of .
i think that the various components that biomass is made from have to be used separately .
and you ca n't forget that biomass offers a reservoir of chemicals that first have to be removed .
the next step is then to make fuel from the cellulose - that is , the straw or grass - but a lot more research is necessary .
only what 's left over should be burned .
the same is true for wood . how do you feel about the balance between food production and energy production ? i feel that without a doubt , food production needs to take priority .
but we should n't forget that there are also grain and other biomass products ill-suited to human consumption that we can use with a clear ethical conscience . should there be international or eu regulation ? the eu will have to revise its targets according to how successfully second-generation biofuels are adopted .
one thing is clear : the 10-percent target wo n't be reached with first-generation biofuels . what does production of biomass mean for rural areas and ultimately , developing countries ? if you consider biomass in a broader context and not only in the context of its use as fuel , then it is apparent that it provides ample opportunities for provision of decentralized energy .

" i 'm very concerned based on some of the tenor and tone of the statements that have been made that the government of iran recognizes that the world is watching , " obama told cbs news .
" and how they approach and deal with people who are , through peaceful means , trying to be heard will , i think , send a pretty clear signal to the international community about what iran is and - and is not . "
asked whether he had a message to the demonstrators , obama replied " i absolutely do . "
" we stand behind those who are seeking justice in a peaceful way , ” obama said .
" we stand with those who would look to peaceful resolution of conflict and we believe that the voices of people have to be heard . "
obama rejects tehran 's claims of intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran says the us has stirred up the protesters the president also attempted to debunk claims by some in the iranian leadership that the opposition demonstrators were acting at the behest of the united states , which has had a long history of antagonism with iran .
tehran , with which washington severed ties shortly after iran 's 1979 islamic revolution , has already accused the united states of " interventionist " statements on the election .
" let 's understand that this notion that somehow these hundreds of thousands of people , who are pouring into the streets in iran , are somehow responding to the west or the united states .
that 's an old distraction that i think has been trotted out periodically .
and that 's just not going to fly . "
obama also said washington must be careful not to become " a foil for those forces inside iran who would love nothing better than to make this an argument about the united states .
that 's what they do .
that 's what we 're already seeing .
we should n't be playing into that . "
obama has been less critical of the election than many european leaders to avoid being accused of meddling in the election and potentially triggering a backlash against the demonstrators just as his administration seeks to engage tehran over its nuclear program .
us officials keen to keep out of developing crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us does n't want to give iran any more ammunition senior us officials earlier stressed that washington was making strenuous efforts to avoid being drawn into the crisis in a way that could be used by the government against the demonstrators .
" the more the united states looks like they are going to interfere , the more it is going to be detrimental , " said one official on condition of anonymity .
" this is not about us . "
despite assurances by top officials that washington would not inject itself into the crisis , both houses of the us congress voted to condemn violence against demonstrators by the government of iran the house resolution , which passed by 405 votes to one , expressed " its support for all iranian citizens who embrace the values of freedom , human rights , civil liberties , and rule of law . "
it also " condemns the ongoing violence against demonstrators by the government of iran and pro-government militias , as well as the ongoing government suppression of independent electronic communication through interference with the internet and cell phones . "
democrat howard berman , chairman of the house foreign affairs committee , said the bill was not a " judgment on who won the iranian elections . "
" it is an acknowledgement that we can not remain silent when cherished , universal principles are under attack . "
critics want harder tone from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain is among those who want a harder tone on friday , senator john mccain told reuters the iranian election was " corrupt " and urged obama to speak out more forcefully on behalf of the demonstrators .
" i 'm not saying send arms to them , i 'm not saying they should foment revolution , i 'm not saying they should do anything but hear that the united states of america supports their assertion of their basic human rights , " said mccain , who lost to obama in last year 's us presidential election .

near enqelab square in the center of the iranian capital massed security forces had responded with force , using teargas and batons , to disperse several thousand protestors - fewer than the hundreds of thousands who had gathered earlier in the week .
but at nightfall rooftop protests with cries of allahu akbar -lrb- god is greatest -rrb- were heard for hours - reportedly from supporters of the moderate opposition leader mirhossein mousavi - in what observers say is an echo of tactics used in the 1979 islamic revolution against the-then shah .
mousavi and another ostensibly defeated candidate mehdi karoubi had not summoned their followers onto the streets .
apparent bombing at mausoleum police appeared to confirm reports that a suicide bomber had detonated his device at the mausoleum of the father of iran 's islamic revolution , the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini .
a television channel , press tv , said the bomber was killed and three others were wounded .
another witness , quoted by reuters , said supporters of mousavi had set fire to a building in southern tehran , reportedly used by basij , a paramiltiary force of the government of president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
three busloads of basij islamic militia and trucks carrying motorcycles used by the paramilitaries were sighted heading for the capital .
unverified footage on the internet showed crowds running away from police lines , several apparently wounded persons and burning vehicles .
riot police reportedly fired shots into the air .
there were no confirmations of casualties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad and rival candidate hossein mousavi opposition candidate mousavi calls for election re-run mousavi in a newsletter posted on a website continued to defy ruling ayatollah ali khamenei .
mousavi reiterated demands for annulment of the june 12 election .
he cited what he called a " huge volume of cheating and changing of votes , " asserting this had been " planned in advance , " and said the ballots should be examined by a " reliable committee . "
he added that he and his supporters were not against the islamic system but just wanted to reform it by " peaceful means . "
witnesses said he also called for a national strike if he was arrested .
since last week scores of reformists have been detained and authorities have cracked down on foreign and domestic media .
at friday prayers , khamenei had ruled out any electoral fraud , saying ahmadinejad had been re-elected by a margin of 11 million votes , and warned protestors of repercussions .
on saturday iran 's powerful 12-man guardian council said it was ready for a random recount of 10 percent of the ballot boxes in response to complaints by mousavi and two other candidates .
the council had invited mousavi , another candidate mehdi karoubi and a third hopeful to a special meeting .
a council spokesman said only the conservative mohsen rezaie , who is a former revolutionary guard , had attended that meeting .

germany ’ s pop music industry has canceled its most important annual trade fair .
popkomm organizers blame a decline in potential exhibitors on the recession and on-line piracy . popkomm , germany 's annual trade fair that normally showcases the pop music industry and youth entertainment trends in berlin and abroad has been canceled for this year .
dieter gorny , who initiated popkomm , originally in cologne , said unpaid music downloads by internet users had left companies struggling . gorny blamed politicians , saying the exhibition 's cancellation was the result of their inaction on piracy .
they had failed to grasp its serious impact , said gorny , who heads of the german bvmi music industry association .

" i 'm very concerned based on some of the tenor and tone of the statements that have been made that the government of iran recognizes that the world is watching , " obama told cbs news .
" and how they approach and deal with people who are , through peaceful means , trying to be heard will , i think , send a pretty clear signal to the international community about what iran is and - and is not . "
asked whether he had a message to the demonstrators , obama replied " i absolutely do . "
" we stand behind those who are seeking justice in a peaceful way , ” obama said .
" we stand with those who would look to peaceful resolution of conflict and we believe that the voices of people have to be heard . "
obama rejects tehran 's claims of intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran says the us has stirred up the protesters the president also attempted to debunk claims by some in the iranian leadership that the opposition demonstrators were acting at the behest of the united states , which has had a long history of antagonism with iran .
tehran , with which washington severed ties shortly after iran 's 1979 islamic revolution , has already accused the united states of " interventionist " statements on the election .
" let 's understand that this notion that somehow these hundreds of thousands of people , who are pouring into the streets in iran , are somehow responding to the west or the united states .
that 's an old distraction that i think has been trotted out periodically .
and that 's just not going to fly . "
obama also said washington must be careful not to become " a foil for those forces inside iran who would love nothing better than to make this an argument about the united states .
that 's what they do .
that 's what we 're already seeing .
we should n't be playing into that . "
obama has been less critical of the election than many european leaders to avoid being accused of meddling in the election and potentially triggering a backlash against the demonstrators just as his administration seeks to engage tehran over its nuclear program .
us officials keen to keep out of developing crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us does n't want to give iran any more ammunition senior us officials earlier stressed that washington was making strenuous efforts to avoid being drawn into the crisis in a way that could be used by the government against the demonstrators .
" the more the united states looks like they are going to interfere , the more it is going to be detrimental , " said one official on condition of anonymity .
" this is not about us . "
despite assurances by top officials that washington would not inject itself into the crisis , both houses of the us congress voted to condemn violence against demonstrators by the government of iran the house resolution , which passed by 405 votes to one , expressed " its support for all iranian citizens who embrace the values of freedom , human rights , civil liberties , and rule of law .

how would you assess the potential there for europe and the rest of the world ? franz fischler : i think that biomass should n't only be seen as the raw material for energy supply , but more broadly as a renewable material .
it can , for example , replace metals or other raw materials - not just oil or gas .
the potential is fairly large , but is also limited .
no one should think that we can just switch from an oil-based to a biomass-based economy right now . the potential is particularly limited when we 're dealing with fuel - also because there 's one thing that can not be questioned : that feeding the world has to have a higher priority than producing or using biomass for energy purposes . five percent of food resources globally are used in the production of biofuels .
at the same time , millions of people are starving .
is it reasonable to use agricultural land for the production of biomass and biofuels ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz fischler i think that you ca n't give a generalized answer to that .
there are situations in which production of energy crops could definitely make sense .
but as i said , these are not all that relevant .
the eu 's goal of meeting 10 percent of fuel consumption with biomass depends on second-generation biofuel - in other words , when bioethanol is no longer made from grain but from straw . heat , electricity and fuel can be produced with biomass .
what use do you feel is most promising ? i 'm an advocate of what 's known as " cascade utilization " of biomass .
in my opinion , biomass is much too valuable to just burn it or make biogas out of .
i think that the various components that biomass is made from have to be used separately .
and you ca n't forget that biomass offers a reservoir of chemicals that first have to be removed .
the next step is then to make fuel from the cellulose - that is , the straw or grass - but a lot more research is necessary .
only what 's left over should be burned .
the same is true for wood . how do you feel about the balance between food production and energy production ? i feel that without a doubt , food production needs to take priority .
but we should n't forget that there are also grain and other biomass products ill-suited to human consumption that we can use with a clear ethical conscience . should there be international or eu regulation ? the eu will have to revise its targets according to how successfully second-generation biofuels are adopted .
one thing is clear : the 10-percent target wo n't be reached with first-generation biofuels . what does production of biomass mean for rural areas and ultimately , developing countries ? if you consider biomass in a broader context and not only in the context of its use as fuel , then it is apparent that it provides ample opportunities for provision of decentralized energy .
the guessing region in austria , for example , is autonomous in its energy production .
in this case , fuel provision plays a minor role .
the focus is on using wood waste and straw as energy and producing various chemicals from biomass . it 's still early days for modern bioenergy use .
are the conditions for sensible use of bioenergy and research in the area helping maximize its potential and leading to its sustainability ? there is intensive research going on and these questions are the focus of the eu 's current research program , but we are still a long way from reaching our targets .
liquefaction of biogas and the use of straw and wood waste and cellulose , for example , are still far from viable options .
the challenge is not only one of technology but also of environmental relevance . what role does the eu play in the development of these technologies ? on the one hand , the eu funds research and development , although only in response to applications - it does n't commission r & d. on the other hand , it funds investments in production , especially in the area of rural development .
what it does n't do is directly subsidize production .

how would you assess the potential there for europe and the rest of the world ? franz fischler : i think that biomass should n't only be seen as the raw material for energy supply , but more broadly as a renewable material .
it can , for example , replace metals or other raw materials - not just oil or gas .
the potential is fairly large , but is also limited .
no one should think that we can just switch from an oil-based to a biomass-based economy right now . the potential is particularly limited when we 're dealing with fuel - also because there 's one thing that can not be questioned : that feeding the world has to have a higher priority than producing or using biomass for energy purposes . five percent of food resources globally are used in the production of biofuels .
at the same time , millions of people are starving .
is it reasonable to use agricultural land for the production of biomass and biofuels ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz fischler i think that you ca n't give a generalized answer to that .
there are situations in which production of energy crops could definitely make sense .
but as i said , these are not all that relevant .
the eu 's goal of meeting 10 percent of fuel consumption with biomass depends on second-generation biofuel - in other words , when bioethanol is no longer made from grain but from straw . heat , electricity and fuel can be produced with biomass .
what use do you feel is most promising ? i 'm an advocate of what 's known as " cascade utilization " of biomass .
in my opinion , biomass is much too valuable to just burn it or make biogas out of .
i think that the various components that biomass is made from have to be used separately .
and you ca n't forget that biomass offers a reservoir of chemicals that first have to be removed .
the next step is then to make fuel from the cellulose - that is , the straw or grass - but a lot more research is necessary .
only what 's left over should be burned .
the same is true for wood . how do you feel about the balance between food production and energy production ? i feel that without a doubt , food production needs to take priority .
but we should n't forget that there are also grain and other biomass products ill-suited to human consumption that we can use with a clear ethical conscience . should there be international or eu regulation ? the eu will have to revise its targets according to how successfully second-generation biofuels are adopted .
one thing is clear : the 10-percent target wo n't be reached with first-generation biofuels . what does production of biomass mean for rural areas and ultimately , developing countries ? if you consider biomass in a broader context and not only in the context of its use as fuel , then it is apparent that it provides ample opportunities for provision of decentralized energy .
the guessing region in austria , for example , is autonomous in its energy production .
in this case , fuel provision plays a minor role .
the focus is on using wood waste and straw as energy and producing various chemicals from biomass . it 's still early days for modern bioenergy use .
are the conditions for sensible use of bioenergy and research in the area helping maximize its potential and leading to its sustainability ? there is intensive research going on and these questions are the focus of the eu 's current research program , but we are still a long way from reaching our targets .
liquefaction of biogas and the use of straw and wood waste and cellulose , for example , are still far from viable options .
the challenge is not only one of technology but also of environmental relevance . what role does the eu play in the development of these technologies ? on the one hand , the eu funds research and development , although only in response to applications - it does n't commission r & d. on the other hand , it funds investments in production , especially in the area of rural development .
what it does n't do is directly subsidize production .
it used to , but stopped because of the " health checks . "
the concept of obligatory land set aside was also done away with .
the eu has turned away from its policy of larger subsidies for grain for energy production than grain for food production . in march 2009 , the eu drew up sustainability criteria for use of biomass .

germany ’ s pop music industry has canceled its most important annual trade fair .
popkomm organizers blame a decline in potential exhibitors on the recession and on-line piracy . popkomm , germany 's annual trade fair that normally showcases the pop music industry and youth entertainment trends in berlin and abroad has been canceled for this year .
dieter gorny , who initiated popkomm , originally in cologne , said unpaid music downloads by internet users had left companies struggling . gorny blamed politicians , saying the exhibition 's cancellation was the result of their inaction on piracy .
they had failed to grasp its serious impact , said gorny , who heads of the german bvmi music industry association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music manager dieter gorny " the digital crisis has hit the music industry head on .
losing revenues to illegal downloads on the internet , many companies can simply no longer afford to participate at popkomm . "
if legislative action was not taken soon all efforts by the music industry would fail to bear fruit , said gorny .
the bvmi says that for every legally purchased download in germany , eight others are pirated .
visitor numbers down popkomm organizers decided to cancel the fair , saying an anticipated 50 percent drop in visitor numbers for this year would have made it impossible to keep the event on a sound professional footing . although popkomm 2008 attracted 842 exhibitors from 52 countries , plus 14,000 industry participants , overall visitor numbers had already dropped by 20 percent ..
popkomm chief ralf kleinhenz said there had been a lot of positive feedback after the event was shifted from cologne to berlin back in 2004 .
but this year there were simply not enough exhibitor and visitor registrations to guarantee a successful event for 2009 .
it had been scheduled to take place in mid-september .
aside from the exhibition , the organizers have also called off the pop music festival that usually adds zest to business transactions at the trade fair .
popkomm organizers say they are working on a new concept for the next trade fair in 2010 .
there will be a sharper focus on networking between participants , as well as a conference and more attractive public events. ipj / dpa / ap editor : greg benzow send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministry 's provisional figures indicate almost a doubling of new borrowings next year to 86 billion euros , compared to the 47.6 billion euros adopted on friday in a supplementary budget for 2009 .

liberal free democrat party spokesman jürgen koppelin said germany was financially worse off than at the beginning of merkel 's coalition in 2005 - despite efforts in recent years to consolidate budgets . koppelin demanded a cash audit straight after the election and rigorous re-examination of all expenditures .

by 2013 , he added , total government debt would be much higher .
ministry projections to be presented to merkel 's cabinet next week show new state borrowings for 2011 of 71 billion euros and 59 billion euros in 2012 .
total federal public expenditure next year is set to rise by eight percent to 328 billion euros but then decline somewhat by 2013 to 313 billion euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 20.06.2009 kremlin 's proxy policy exposed as unruly provinces slip toward anarchy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's power is seen but not heard in the southern provinces with moscow 's attention elsewhere in these days of financial instability , a string of high-profile assassinations in the mainly muslim provinces of southern russia is forcing the kremlin to take notice . in ingushetia last saturday , bashir aushev , the vice premier under former president murat zyazikov , was gunned down in the former regional capital of nasran .
islamist rebels are believed to be responsible for the shooting .
aushev 's death came just days after the deputy chairwoman of the country 's supreme court was shot dead on june 10 .
also last saturday , two policemen were killed in the latest resumption of fighting between rebels and pro-moscow forces in chechnya .
the officers died during a shoot-out with a group of 15 rebel fighters in a forested area near the eastern village of alkinchu-borzoi , less than two months after the kremlin 's decision in april to end a decade-long " counter-terrorist operation " in the region .
a day before that , two members of the security forces and two rebels were shot dead in separate incidents in dagestan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev expressed concern hours before another murder these killings came just hours after russian president dmitry medvedev flew with his top national security officials to dagestan for a special meeting .
medvedev 's visit followed the assassination of the region 's interior minister , adilgerei magomedtagirov , who was shot dead by a sniper in a brazen daylight attack during the wedding of a colleague 's daughter .
some analysts believe that rebel forces in these unstable regions are taking advantage of moscow 's preoccupation with issues closer to home and the perceived belief in the kremlin that as long as the instability remains localized it remains a problem for the provinces ' authorities to deal with .
but moscow is in danger of slipping into a false sense of security .
after returning stability of sorts to chechnya after two devastating wars and installing former rebel ramzan kadyrov as its proxy leader in grozny , some believe the kremlin is under the impression that the threat from the region is minimal .
moscow turns a blind-eye to southern murders " russia 's policy is one part turning a blind-eye and one part containment , " andrew wilson , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the moscow elite think that murders in the south are n't a problem .
it would only be a problem if it spilled into diaspora killings in moscow . "
" kadyrov has been testing moscow 's limits by targeting his enemies all over the globe but he has a certain license because the claim of stability in chechnya is all important to the kremlin .
for the other republics , as long as it remains local , russia lets it fester .
it 's likely that this festering will get a lot worse , " wilson said . there is a growing consensus that the unrest which is growing in these regions has much to do with the kremlin 's policy of handing control to local elites to try to stem disorder .
at the end of the second chechen war , the kremlin made a decision to effectively contract out the running of the ethnically diverse regions .
if local leaders could provide relative peace and stability , the kremlin would give them a free hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov has been left to his own devices in chechnya " russia was dealing with the devil when it came to chechnya , " said wilson .
" clearly kadyrov is a leader who is most problematic .
he 's running free and is a law unto himself .
he is a problem in at least two ways .
he sets a very bad example by constantly pushing the limits of what 's possible .

islamist rebels are believed to be responsible for the shooting .
aushev 's death came just days after the deputy chairwoman of the country 's supreme court was shot dead on june 10 .
also last saturday , two policemen were killed in the latest resumption of fighting between rebels and pro-moscow forces in chechnya .
the officers died during a shoot-out with a group of 15 rebel fighters in a forested area near the eastern village of alkinchu-borzoi , less than two months after the kremlin 's decision in april to end a decade-long " counter-terrorist operation " in the region .
a day before that , two members of the security forces and two rebels were shot dead in separate incidents in dagestan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev expressed concern hours before another murder these killings came just hours after russian president dmitry medvedev flew with his top national security officials to dagestan for a special meeting .
medvedev 's visit followed the assassination of the region 's interior minister , adilgerei magomedtagirov , who was shot dead by a sniper in a brazen daylight attack during the wedding of a colleague 's daughter .
some analysts believe that rebel forces in these unstable regions are taking advantage of moscow 's preoccupation with issues closer to home and the perceived belief in the kremlin that as long as the instability remains localized it remains a problem for the provinces ' authorities to deal with .
but moscow is in danger of slipping into a false sense of security .
after returning stability of sorts to chechnya after two devastating wars and installing former rebel ramzan kadyrov as its proxy leader in grozny , some believe the kremlin is under the impression that the threat from the region is minimal .
moscow turns a blind-eye to southern murders " russia 's policy is one part turning a blind-eye and one part containment , " andrew wilson , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the moscow elite think that murders in the south are n't a problem .
it would only be a problem if it spilled into diaspora killings in moscow . "
" kadyrov has been testing moscow 's limits by targeting his enemies all over the globe but he has a certain license because the claim of stability in chechnya is all important to the kremlin .
for the other republics , as long as it remains local , russia lets it fester .
it 's likely that this festering will get a lot worse , " wilson said . there is a growing consensus that the unrest which is growing in these regions has much to do with the kremlin 's policy of handing control to local elites to try to stem disorder .
at the end of the second chechen war , the kremlin made a decision to effectively contract out the running of the ethnically diverse regions .
if local leaders could provide relative peace and stability , the kremlin would give them a free hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov has been left to his own devices in chechnya " russia was dealing with the devil when it came to chechnya , " said wilson .
" clearly kadyrov is a leader who is most problematic .
he 's running free and is a law unto himself .
he is a problem in at least two ways .
he sets a very bad example by constantly pushing the limits of what 's possible .
secondly , there has been a certain displacement effect where he has pushed radicals and his enemies out of chechnya into the neighboring republics and they of course cause trouble elsewhere . "
commentators say the kremlin is nervous that it has allowed kadyrov to accumulate too much power amid the mass withdrawal of russian servicemen after the last war .

how would you assess the potential there for europe and the rest of the world ? franz fischler : i think that biomass should n't only be seen as the raw material for energy supply , but more broadly as a renewable material .
it can , for example , replace metals or other raw materials - not just oil or gas .
the potential is fairly large , but is also limited .
no one should think that we can just switch from an oil-based to a biomass-based economy right now . the potential is particularly limited when we 're dealing with fuel - also because there 's one thing that can not be questioned : that feeding the world has to have a higher priority than producing or using biomass for energy purposes . five percent of food resources globally are used in the production of biofuels .
at the same time , millions of people are starving .
is it reasonable to use agricultural land for the production of biomass and biofuels ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz fischler i think that you ca n't give a generalized answer to that .
there are situations in which production of energy crops could definitely make sense .
but as i said , these are not all that relevant .
the eu 's goal of meeting 10 percent of fuel consumption with biomass depends on second-generation biofuel - in other words , when bioethanol is no longer made from grain but from straw . heat , electricity and fuel can be produced with biomass .
what use do you feel is most promising ? i 'm an advocate of what 's known as " cascade utilization " of biomass .
in my opinion , biomass is much too valuable to just burn it or make biogas out of .
i think that the various components that biomass is made from have to be used separately .
and you ca n't forget that biomass offers a reservoir of chemicals that first have to be removed .
the next step is then to make fuel from the cellulose - that is , the straw or grass - but a lot more research is necessary .
only what 's left over should be burned .
the same is true for wood . how do you feel about the balance between food production and energy production ? i feel that without a doubt , food production needs to take priority .
but we should n't forget that there are also grain and other biomass products ill-suited to human consumption that we can use with a clear ethical conscience . should there be international or eu regulation ? the eu will have to revise its targets according to how successfully second-generation biofuels are adopted .
one thing is clear : the 10-percent target wo n't be reached with first-generation biofuels . what does production of biomass mean for rural areas and ultimately , developing countries ? if you consider biomass in a broader context and not only in the context of its use as fuel , then it is apparent that it provides ample opportunities for provision of decentralized energy .
the guessing region in austria , for example , is autonomous in its energy production .
in this case , fuel provision plays a minor role .
the focus is on using wood waste and straw as energy and producing various chemicals from biomass . it 's still early days for modern bioenergy use .
are the conditions for sensible use of bioenergy and research in the area helping maximize its potential and leading to its sustainability ? there is intensive research going on and these questions are the focus of the eu 's current research program , but we are still a long way from reaching our targets .
liquefaction of biogas and the use of straw and wood waste and cellulose , for example , are still far from viable options .
the challenge is not only one of technology but also of environmental relevance . what role does the eu play in the development of these technologies ? on the one hand , the eu funds research and development , although only in response to applications - it does n't commission r & d. on the other hand , it funds investments in production , especially in the area of rural development .
what it does n't do is directly subsidize production .
it used to , but stopped because of the " health checks . "
the concept of obligatory land set aside was also done away with .
the eu has turned away from its policy of larger subsidies for grain for energy production than grain for food production . in march 2009 , the eu drew up sustainability criteria for use of biomass .
can you tell us what they are ? these are still only draft criteria , based on the principle that standards need to be introduced to determine what kind of greenhouse gas savings should be achieved by sustainable biomass .
there are diverging opinions on what the lowest level of carbon emissions should be .
for biofuels , the european commission 's requirement was for a 30-percent savings , but a 50-percent savings appears to be a more likely target . how important will biomass be by the mid-21st century ? a lot more important than it is now .
the more innovation we see , the more important it will become . franz fischler is the chairman of the eco-social forum austria for the development of bioenergy . interview : gero reuter -lrb- jp -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a few minutes ago , a suicide bomber exploded himself in the shrine , " police official hossein sajedinia was quoted by the semi-official mehr news agency as saying . two people were wounded in the incident in the northern wing of the shrine , another news agency , fars , said . in revolution square , thousands of protesters and riot police clashed as the police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the crowds who had gathered to protest in open defiance of iran 's cleric-led government . earlier , iran 's highest legislative body said it was prepared to recount a tenth of the votes , but supporters of the opposition have been demanding a complete annulment of the presidential poll . iran 's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , warned protest leaders on friday that they would be responsible for any bloodshed if rallies continued against the june 12 election , which he said the incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad had won fairly by 11 million votes . the protests had been cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah ali khamenei warned protesters on friday that they would be responsible for any bloodshed the group , which planned to organize the rally , had said it would not go ahead with the demonstration because it did not receive the required permission to do so from the authorities . the combatant clerics assembly -lrb- acc -rrb- , a group of moderate clerics , said it and supporters of opposition leader , mir hossein mousavi , were issued a stern warning not to encourage demonstrators to gather in the capital , tehran . the acc , which is close to mousavi and former president mohammad khatami , believes that massive fraud took place in last week 's presidential ballot , which led to the re-election of incumbent president , mahmoud ahmadinejad . iran 's interior ministry said on saturday that mousavi would be " held responsible for the consequences of any illegal gatherings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.06.2009 germany 's public debt heading for new record levels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is facing a surge in new state borrowings provisional data from germany 's finance ministry projects new record levels of public debt over the next five years as berlin tackles the recession with economic stimulus measures . germany 's finance ministry has warned of a " dramatic increase " in public debt in germany over the next five years because of the global economic crisis and government responses .
the ministry 's provisional figures indicate almost a doubling of new borrowings next year to 86 billion euros , compared to the 47.6 billion euros adopted on friday in a supplementary budget for 2009 .
new borrowings , to plug the gap between public expenditure versus revenues , are already at a post-war record .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes " illusory " , says finance minister steinbrueck in the bundestag parliament , finance minister peer steinbrueck said the sharp recession and stimulus packages recently enacted by chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government , had led inevitably to a combination of falling tax revenues and higher borrowings .
calls by some to lower taxes were " illusory " , he added .
ahead of germany 's federal election in september , several opposition parties slammed the latest projections .
liberal free democrat party spokesman jürgen koppelin said germany was financially worse off than at the beginning of merkel 's coalition in 2005 - despite efforts in recent years to consolidate budgets . koppelin demanded a cash audit straight after the election and rigorous re-examination of all expenditures .
the greens ' budgetary expert alexander bonde said the projected 86 billion euro gap in projected new borrowings was a " fatal " development .
by 2013 , he added , total government debt would be much higher .
ministry projections to be presented to merkel 's cabinet next week show new state borrowings for 2011 of 71 billion euros and 59 billion euros in 2012 .
total federal public expenditure next year is set to rise by eight percent to 328 billion euros but then decline somewhat by 2013 to 313 billion euros .
next year 's biggest spender will be the federal ministry of labour and social affairs , representing half of the overall budget .
its spending includes funding for germany 's 3.5 million unemployed and 1.2 million workers on so-called kurzarbeit , subsidised shortened working hours .

the ministry 's provisional figures indicate almost a doubling of new borrowings next year to 86 billion euros , compared to the 47.6 billion euros adopted on friday in a supplementary budget for 2009 .
new borrowings , to plug the gap between public expenditure versus revenues , are already at a post-war record .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes " illusory " , says finance minister steinbrueck in the bundestag parliament , finance minister peer steinbrueck said the sharp recession and stimulus packages recently enacted by chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government , had led inevitably to a combination of falling tax revenues and higher borrowings .
calls by some to lower taxes were " illusory " , he added .
ahead of germany 's federal election in september , several opposition parties slammed the latest projections .
liberal free democrat party spokesman jürgen koppelin said germany was financially worse off than at the beginning of merkel 's coalition in 2005 - despite efforts in recent years to consolidate budgets . koppelin demanded a cash audit straight after the election and rigorous re-examination of all expenditures .
the greens ' budgetary expert alexander bonde said the projected 86 billion euro gap in projected new borrowings was a " fatal " development .
by 2013 , he added , total government debt would be much higher .
ministry projections to be presented to merkel 's cabinet next week show new state borrowings for 2011 of 71 billion euros and 59 billion euros in 2012 .
total federal public expenditure next year is set to rise by eight percent to 328 billion euros but then decline somewhat by 2013 to 313 billion euros .
next year 's biggest spender will be the federal ministry of labour and social affairs , representing half of the overall budget .
its spending includes funding for germany 's 3.5 million unemployed and 1.2 million workers on so-called kurzarbeit , subsidised shortened working hours .

how would you assess the potential there for europe and the rest of the world ? franz fischler : i think that biomass should n't only be seen as the raw material for energy supply , but more broadly as a renewable material .
it can , for example , replace metals or other raw materials - not just oil or gas .
the potential is fairly large , but is also limited .
no one should think that we can just switch from an oil-based to a biomass-based economy right now . the potential is particularly limited when we 're dealing with fuel - also because there 's one thing that can not be questioned : that feeding the world has to have a higher priority than producing or using biomass for energy purposes . five percent of food resources globally are used in the production of biofuels .
at the same time , millions of people are starving .
is it reasonable to use agricultural land for the production of biomass and biofuels ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz fischler i think that you ca n't give a generalized answer to that .
there are situations in which production of energy crops could definitely make sense .
but as i said , these are not all that relevant .
the eu 's goal of meeting 10 percent of fuel consumption with biomass depends on second-generation biofuel - in other words , when bioethanol is no longer made from grain but from straw . heat , electricity and fuel can be produced with biomass .
what use do you feel is most promising ? i 'm an advocate of what 's known as " cascade utilization " of biomass .
in my opinion , biomass is much too valuable to just burn it or make biogas out of .
i think that the various components that biomass is made from have to be used separately .
and you ca n't forget that biomass offers a reservoir of chemicals that first have to be removed .
the next step is then to make fuel from the cellulose - that is , the straw or grass - but a lot more research is necessary .
only what 's left over should be burned .
the same is true for wood . how do you feel about the balance between food production and energy production ? i feel that without a doubt , food production needs to take priority .
but we should n't forget that there are also grain and other biomass products ill-suited to human consumption that we can use with a clear ethical conscience . should there be international or eu regulation ? the eu will have to revise its targets according to how successfully second-generation biofuels are adopted .
one thing is clear : the 10-percent target wo n't be reached with first-generation biofuels . what does production of biomass mean for rural areas and ultimately , developing countries ? if you consider biomass in a broader context and not only in the context of its use as fuel , then it is apparent that it provides ample opportunities for provision of decentralized energy .
the guessing region in austria , for example , is autonomous in its energy production .
in this case , fuel provision plays a minor role .
the focus is on using wood waste and straw as energy and producing various chemicals from biomass . it 's still early days for modern bioenergy use .
are the conditions for sensible use of bioenergy and research in the area helping maximize its potential and leading to its sustainability ? there is intensive research going on and these questions are the focus of the eu 's current research program , but we are still a long way from reaching our targets .
liquefaction of biogas and the use of straw and wood waste and cellulose , for example , are still far from viable options .
the challenge is not only one of technology but also of environmental relevance . what role does the eu play in the development of these technologies ? on the one hand , the eu funds research and development , although only in response to applications - it does n't commission r & d. on the other hand , it funds investments in production , especially in the area of rural development .
what it does n't do is directly subsidize production .
it used to , but stopped because of the " health checks . "
the concept of obligatory land set aside was also done away with .
the eu has turned away from its policy of larger subsidies for grain for energy production than grain for food production . in march 2009 , the eu drew up sustainability criteria for use of biomass .
can you tell us what they are ? these are still only draft criteria , based on the principle that standards need to be introduced to determine what kind of greenhouse gas savings should be achieved by sustainable biomass .
there are diverging opinions on what the lowest level of carbon emissions should be .
for biofuels , the european commission 's requirement was for a 30-percent savings , but a 50-percent savings appears to be a more likely target . how important will biomass be by the mid-21st century ? a lot more important than it is now .
the more innovation we see , the more important it will become . franz fischler is the chairman of the eco-social forum austria for the development of bioenergy . interview : gero reuter -lrb- jp -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a few minutes ago , a suicide bomber exploded himself in the shrine , " police official hossein sajedinia was quoted by the semi-official mehr news agency as saying . two people were wounded in the incident in the northern wing of the shrine , another news agency , fars , said . in revolution square , thousands of protesters and riot police clashed as the police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the crowds who had gathered to protest in open defiance of iran 's cleric-led government . earlier , iran 's highest legislative body said it was prepared to recount a tenth of the votes , but supporters of the opposition have been demanding a complete annulment of the presidential poll . iran 's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , warned protest leaders on friday that they would be responsible for any bloodshed if rallies continued against the june 12 election , which he said the incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad had won fairly by 11 million votes . the protests had been cancelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah ali khamenei warned protesters on friday that they would be responsible for any bloodshed the group , which planned to organize the rally , had said it would not go ahead with the demonstration because it did not receive the required permission to do so from the authorities . the combatant clerics assembly -lrb- acc -rrb- , a group of moderate clerics , said it and supporters of opposition leader , mir hossein mousavi , were issued a stern warning not to encourage demonstrators to gather in the capital , tehran . the acc , which is close to mousavi and former president mohammad khatami , believes that massive fraud took place in last week 's presidential ballot , which led to the re-election of incumbent president , mahmoud ahmadinejad . iran 's interior ministry said on saturday that mousavi would be " held responsible for the consequences of any illegal gatherings .

" i 'm very concerned based on some of the tenor and tone of the statements that have been made that the government of iran recognizes that the world is watching , " obama told cbs news .
" and how they approach and deal with people who are , through peaceful means , trying to be heard will , i think , send a pretty clear signal to the international community about what iran is and - and is not . "
asked whether he had a message to the demonstrators , obama replied " i absolutely do . "
" we stand behind those who are seeking justice in a peaceful way , ” obama said .
" we stand with those who would look to peaceful resolution of conflict and we believe that the voices of people have to be heard . "
obama rejects tehran 's claims of intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran says the us has stirred up the protesters the president also attempted to debunk claims by some in the iranian leadership that the opposition demonstrators were acting at the behest of the united states , which has had a long history of antagonism with iran .
tehran , with which washington severed ties shortly after iran 's 1979 islamic revolution , has already accused the united states of " interventionist " statements on the election .
" let 's understand that this notion that somehow these hundreds of thousands of people , who are pouring into the streets in iran , are somehow responding to the west or the united states .
that 's an old distraction that i think has been trotted out periodically .
and that 's just not going to fly . "
obama also said washington must be careful not to become " a foil for those forces inside iran who would love nothing better than to make this an argument about the united states .
that 's what they do .
that 's what we 're already seeing .
we should n't be playing into that . "
obama has been less critical of the election than many european leaders to avoid being accused of meddling in the election and potentially triggering a backlash against the demonstrators just as his administration seeks to engage tehran over its nuclear program .

" the more the united states looks like they are going to interfere , the more it is going to be detrimental , " said one official on condition of anonymity .
" this is not about us . "
despite assurances by top officials that washington would not inject itself into the crisis , both houses of the us congress voted to condemn violence against demonstrators by the government of iran the house resolution , which passed by 405 votes to one , expressed " its support for all iranian citizens who embrace the values of freedom , human rights , civil liberties , and rule of law . "
it also " condemns the ongoing violence against demonstrators by the government of iran and pro-government militias , as well as the ongoing government suppression of independent electronic communication through interference with the internet and cell phones . "
democrat howard berman , chairman of the house foreign affairs committee , said the bill was not a " judgment on who won the iranian elections . "
" it is an acknowledgement that we can not remain silent when cherished , universal principles are under attack . "

near enqelab square in the center of the iranian capital massed security forces had responded with force , using teargas and batons , to disperse several thousand protestors - fewer than the hundreds of thousands who had gathered earlier in the week .
but at nightfall rooftop protests with cries of allahu akbar -lrb- god is greatest -rrb- were heard for hours - reportedly from supporters of the moderate opposition leader mirhossein mousavi - in what observers say is an echo of tactics used in the 1979 islamic revolution against the-then shah .
mousavi and another ostensibly defeated candidate mehdi karoubi had not summoned their followers onto the streets .
apparent bombing at mausoleum police appeared to confirm reports that a suicide bomber had detonated his device at the mausoleum of the father of iran 's islamic revolution , the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini .
a television channel , press tv , said the bomber was killed and three others were wounded .
another witness , quoted by reuters , said supporters of mousavi had set fire to a building in southern tehran , reportedly used by basij , a paramiltiary force of the government of president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
three busloads of basij islamic militia and trucks carrying motorcycles used by the paramilitaries were sighted heading for the capital .

mousavi reiterated demands for annulment of the june 12 election .
he cited what he called a " huge volume of cheating and changing of votes , " asserting this had been " planned in advance , " and said the ballots should be examined by a " reliable committee . "
he added that he and his supporters were not against the islamic system but just wanted to reform it by " peaceful means . "
witnesses said he also called for a national strike if he was arrested .
since last week scores of reformists have been detained and authorities have cracked down on foreign and domestic media .
at friday prayers , khamenei had ruled out any electoral fraud , saying ahmadinejad had been re-elected by a margin of 11 million votes , and warned protestors of repercussions .
on saturday iran 's powerful 12-man guardian council said it was ready for a random recount of 10 percent of the ballot boxes in response to complaints by mousavi and two other candidates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : iranian election crisis mousavi issues unprecedented criticism of khamenei as iran unrest grows ayatollah khamenei calls for calm but condemns those questioning vote post-election protests continue in iran internet proxies let iranians and others connect to blocked web sites iran -pipe- 20.06.2009 obama speaks out on iran as white house sharpens tone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has been cautious not to inflame the iranian situation us president barack obama toughened his stance on iran friday when he warned that the " world is watching " its actions , and said the united states stood with those seeking " peaceful " justice in the post-election tumult . obama 's comments came after a strong warning to protest leaders by iran 's supreme leader and criticism by republican lawmakers , led by senator john mccain , of a tepid white house response to the protests and to charges that last week 's presidential vote was rigged .
" i 'm very concerned based on some of the tenor and tone of the statements that have been made that the government of iran recognizes that the world is watching , " obama told cbs news .
" and how they approach and deal with people who are , through peaceful means , trying to be heard will , i think , send a pretty clear signal to the international community about what iran is and - and is not . "
asked whether he had a message to the demonstrators , obama replied " i absolutely do . "
" we stand behind those who are seeking justice in a peaceful way , ” obama said .
" we stand with those who would look to peaceful resolution of conflict and we believe that the voices of people have to be heard . "
obama rejects tehran 's claims of intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran says the us has stirred up the protesters the president also attempted to debunk claims by some in the iranian leadership that the opposition demonstrators were acting at the behest of the united states , which has had a long history of antagonism with iran .
tehran , with which washington severed ties shortly after iran 's 1979 islamic revolution , has already accused the united states of " interventionist " statements on the election .
" let 's understand that this notion that somehow these hundreds of thousands of people , who are pouring into the streets in iran , are somehow responding to the west or the united states .
that 's an old distraction that i think has been trotted out periodically .
and that 's just not going to fly . "
obama also said washington must be careful not to become " a foil for those forces inside iran who would love nothing better than to make this an argument about the united states .
that 's what they do .
that 's what we 're already seeing .
we should n't be playing into that . "
obama has been less critical of the election than many european leaders to avoid being accused of meddling in the election and potentially triggering a backlash against the demonstrators just as his administration seeks to engage tehran over its nuclear program .
us officials keen to keep out of developing crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us does n't want to give iran any more ammunition senior us officials earlier stressed that washington was making strenuous efforts to avoid being drawn into the crisis in a way that could be used by the government against the demonstrators .
" the more the united states looks like they are going to interfere , the more it is going to be detrimental , " said one official on condition of anonymity .
" this is not about us . "
despite assurances by top officials that washington would not inject itself into the crisis , both houses of the us congress voted to condemn violence against demonstrators by the government of iran the house resolution , which passed by 405 votes to one , expressed " its support for all iranian citizens who embrace the values of freedom , human rights , civil liberties , and rule of law . "
it also " condemns the ongoing violence against demonstrators by the government of iran and pro-government militias , as well as the ongoing government suppression of independent electronic communication through interference with the internet and cell phones . "
democrat howard berman , chairman of the house foreign affairs committee , said the bill was not a " judgment on who won the iranian elections . "
" it is an acknowledgement that we can not remain silent when cherished , universal principles are under attack . "
critics want harder tone from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain is among those who want a harder tone on friday , senator john mccain told reuters the iranian election was " corrupt " and urged obama to speak out more forcefully on behalf of the demonstrators .
" i 'm not saying send arms to them , i 'm not saying they should foment revolution , i 'm not saying they should do anything but hear that the united states of america supports their assertion of their basic human rights , " said mccain , who lost to obama in last year 's us presidential election .
iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said on friday that last week 's election was won fairly by president mahmoud ahmadinejad and not rigged , as defeated candidate mirhossein mousavi alleges .

schrot is a member of the youth group of the christian democratic union or cdu , who ran on the slogan " recognize the strength of pluralism . "
among schrot 's other platform issues were his demands for more nuclear power for germany and more cooperation and less political bickering .
on the zdf web site , one can still watch the videos submitted by six finalists , who lay out their political agendas .
most of the videos are simple and grainy , and appear to have been shot almost spontaneously in a family basement .
but some did go a bit further .
one candidate , philip kalisch , 31 , who came in second place , got a friend to film him on his balcony , and is styled like a long lost member of the popular rock band kings of leon .
television 's allure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three judges weighed the candidates but the winner was chosen by viewers zdf is betting that the youth of germany might well warm to politics if it gets them on a tv casting show .
some 2,500 people between the ages of 18 and 35 submitted videos through the network 's web site .
that 's a far cry from the 30,000 who tried out for the last season of " deutschland sucht den superstar " - germany 's version of pop idol - or the mob scene that ensued in duesseldorf earlier this year when heidi klum held an open casting for " germany 's next top model . "
but producers said they thought the turnout for kanzler was good , considering it 's a show that nobody has ever seen .
from that pool of 2,500 applicants , 40 were selected to come to bonn .
there , each one made a brief speech in the old bundestag .
sizing them up was a panel of judges made up of a politician , a tv talk show host who 's interviewed quite a few politicians , and a comedy actress with experience in sending them up .
grooming candidates early the show is not really meant to find the country a future head of government .
but the exposure gained on the show , some believe , might well catapult the contestants into public roles within their chosen parties that could lead to much more in the future .
" among the 40 that we had at the audition ; " the host of the show steffen seibert said , " there were definitely at least 10 that i could see , 10 or 15 years from now , in leading positions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists gave speeches on live television from the old bundestag for the most part , however , said the politician on the panel , the former premier of the german city-state of bremen , henning scherf , the show is an attempt to make politics an exciting topic - or even a career choice - among young people .
" i hope it will embolden smart , young , engaged people to participate in the political process .
they have to have role models , and they have to have incentives , " said scherf .
" we have to strive to make sure they are convinced it 's worth their while , and arouse their curiosity - not just preach to them . "
the push to get young people involved is stepping into high gear , as germany prepares to vote for a new government on september 27 .
canadian import the show is patterned after the cbc program " canada 's next great prime minister . "
it grew up out of an essay contest , made it to the network three years ago , and ended up as a surprise hit .
for the latest edition , the fourth on the cbc , the network even lured alex trebek , superstar host of the american game show " jeopardy ! " to come back to his native canada to present the program .
the show also has some even bigger names on its panel of judges : former prime ministers brian mulroney , kim campbell , joe clark and paul martin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 20.06.2009 snubbed by german government , porsche looks elsewhere for help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been uphill for porsche since trying to take over vw with germany 's state-owned kfw bank increasingly unlikely to come to the rescue of porsche , the ailing car maker has reportedly entered talks with rival daimler and the gulf state of qatar in an attempt to win investors . german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , in an interview with the bild newspaper to be published on sunday , june 21 , confirmed that kfw was not in favor of handing out a massive loan to the luxury car maker .
the final decision will be made by a government commission , which is to meet at a yet-unspecified date .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says porsche should find private investors " objectively , the chances of receiving a positive reply are becoming slimmer following the negative opinion issued by kfw , " guttenberg said .
the minister said the request for government aid was being looked into but insisted that " any company should first and foremost try to solve any problems without help from the government . "
" finding investors , however , is the company 's own business and politics should certainly stay away from that , " he said .
porsche has asked for a 1.75-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.4-billion -rrb- loan from kfw and will now have a chance to improve the bid .
the luxury car maker says it will continue negotiations with the bank in the hope that the loan may still get approved .
investor talks with daimler and qatar porsche is currently in talks with qatar to win the gulf state as an investor .
media reports are suggesting qatar might take a stake in porsche of somewhere between 25 and 30 percent , which would amount to a blocking minority .

the final decision will be made by a government commission , which is to meet at a yet-unspecified date .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says porsche should find private investors " objectively , the chances of receiving a positive reply are becoming slimmer following the negative opinion issued by kfw , " guttenberg said .
the minister said the request for government aid was being looked into but insisted that " any company should first and foremost try to solve any problems without help from the government . "
" finding investors , however , is the company 's own business and politics should certainly stay away from that , " he said .
porsche has asked for a 1.75-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.4-billion -rrb- loan from kfw and will now have a chance to improve the bid .
the luxury car maker says it will continue negotiations with the bank in the hope that the loan may still get approved .
investor talks with daimler and qatar porsche is currently in talks with qatar to win the gulf state as an investor .
media reports are suggesting qatar might take a stake in porsche of somewhere between 25 and 30 percent , which would amount to a blocking minority .
the car maker is still largely controlled by the owner families of porsche and piech .
on saturday , newsmagazine manager magazin also reported that porsche had entered talks with yet another possible investor – rival car company daimler , the owners of the mercedes car brand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : iranian election crisis mousavi issues unprecedented criticism of khamenei as iran unrest grows ayatollah khamenei calls for calm but condemns those questioning vote post-election protests continue in iran internet proxies let iranians and others connect to blocked web sites iran -pipe- 20.06.2009 obama speaks out on iran as white house sharpens tone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has been cautious not to inflame the iranian situation us president barack obama toughened his stance on iran friday when he warned that the " world is watching " its actions , and said the united states stood with those seeking " peaceful " justice in the post-election tumult . obama 's comments came after a strong warning to protest leaders by iran 's supreme leader and criticism by republican lawmakers , led by senator john mccain , of a tepid white house response to the protests and to charges that last week 's presidential vote was rigged .
" i 'm very concerned based on some of the tenor and tone of the statements that have been made that the government of iran recognizes that the world is watching , " obama told cbs news .
" and how they approach and deal with people who are , through peaceful means , trying to be heard will , i think , send a pretty clear signal to the international community about what iran is and - and is not . "
asked whether he had a message to the demonstrators , obama replied " i absolutely do . "
" we stand behind those who are seeking justice in a peaceful way , ” obama said .
" we stand with those who would look to peaceful resolution of conflict and we believe that the voices of people have to be heard . "
obama rejects tehran 's claims of intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran says the us has stirred up the protesters the president also attempted to debunk claims by some in the iranian leadership that the opposition demonstrators were acting at the behest of the united states , which has had a long history of antagonism with iran .
tehran , with which washington severed ties shortly after iran 's 1979 islamic revolution , has already accused the united states of " interventionist " statements on the election .
" let 's understand that this notion that somehow these hundreds of thousands of people , who are pouring into the streets in iran , are somehow responding to the west or the united states .
that 's an old distraction that i think has been trotted out periodically .
and that 's just not going to fly . "
obama also said washington must be careful not to become " a foil for those forces inside iran who would love nothing better than to make this an argument about the united states .
that 's what they do .
that 's what we 're already seeing .
we should n't be playing into that . "
obama has been less critical of the election than many european leaders to avoid being accused of meddling in the election and potentially triggering a backlash against the demonstrators just as his administration seeks to engage tehran over its nuclear program .
us officials keen to keep out of developing crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us does n't want to give iran any more ammunition senior us officials earlier stressed that washington was making strenuous efforts to avoid being drawn into the crisis in a way that could be used by the government against the demonstrators .
" the more the united states looks like they are going to interfere , the more it is going to be detrimental , " said one official on condition of anonymity .
" this is not about us . "
despite assurances by top officials that washington would not inject itself into the crisis , both houses of the us congress voted to condemn violence against demonstrators by the government of iran the house resolution , which passed by 405 votes to one , expressed " its support for all iranian citizens who embrace the values of freedom , human rights , civil liberties , and rule of law . "
it also " condemns the ongoing violence against demonstrators by the government of iran and pro-government militias , as well as the ongoing government suppression of independent electronic communication through interference with the internet and cell phones . "
democrat howard berman , chairman of the house foreign affairs committee , said the bill was not a " judgment on who won the iranian elections . "
" it is an acknowledgement that we can not remain silent when cherished , universal principles are under attack . "
critics want harder tone from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain is among those who want a harder tone on friday , senator john mccain told reuters the iranian election was " corrupt " and urged obama to speak out more forcefully on behalf of the demonstrators .
" i 'm not saying send arms to them , i 'm not saying they should foment revolution , i 'm not saying they should do anything but hear that the united states of america supports their assertion of their basic human rights , " said mccain , who lost to obama in last year 's us presidential election .
iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said on friday that last week 's election was won fairly by president mahmoud ahmadinejad and not rigged , as defeated candidate mirhossein mousavi alleges .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 20.06.2009 kremlin 's proxy policy exposed as unruly provinces slip toward anarchy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's power is seen but not heard in the southern provinces with moscow 's attention elsewhere in these days of financial instability , a string of high-profile assassinations in the mainly muslim provinces of southern russia is forcing the kremlin to take notice . in ingushetia last saturday , bashir aushev , the vice premier under former president murat zyazikov , was gunned down in the former regional capital of nasran .
islamist rebels are believed to be responsible for the shooting .
aushev 's death came just days after the deputy chairwoman of the country 's supreme court was shot dead on june 10 .
also last saturday , two policemen were killed in the latest resumption of fighting between rebels and pro-moscow forces in chechnya .
the officers died during a shoot-out with a group of 15 rebel fighters in a forested area near the eastern village of alkinchu-borzoi , less than two months after the kremlin 's decision in april to end a decade-long " counter-terrorist operation " in the region .
a day before that , two members of the security forces and two rebels were shot dead in separate incidents in dagestan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev expressed concern hours before another murder these killings came just hours after russian president dmitry medvedev flew with his top national security officials to dagestan for a special meeting .
medvedev 's visit followed the assassination of the region 's interior minister , adilgerei magomedtagirov , who was shot dead by a sniper in a brazen daylight attack during the wedding of a colleague 's daughter .
some analysts believe that rebel forces in these unstable regions are taking advantage of moscow 's preoccupation with issues closer to home and the perceived belief in the kremlin that as long as the instability remains localized it remains a problem for the provinces ' authorities to deal with .
but moscow is in danger of slipping into a false sense of security .
after returning stability of sorts to chechnya after two devastating wars and installing former rebel ramzan kadyrov as its proxy leader in grozny , some believe the kremlin is under the impression that the threat from the region is minimal .
moscow turns a blind-eye to southern murders " russia 's policy is one part turning a blind-eye and one part containment , " andrew wilson , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the moscow elite think that murders in the south are n't a problem .
it would only be a problem if it spilled into diaspora killings in moscow . "
" kadyrov has been testing moscow 's limits by targeting his enemies all over the globe but he has a certain license because the claim of stability in chechnya is all important to the kremlin .
for the other republics , as long as it remains local , russia lets it fester .
it 's likely that this festering will get a lot worse , " wilson said . there is a growing consensus that the unrest which is growing in these regions has much to do with the kremlin 's policy of handing control to local elites to try to stem disorder .
at the end of the second chechen war , the kremlin made a decision to effectively contract out the running of the ethnically diverse regions .
if local leaders could provide relative peace and stability , the kremlin would give them a free hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov has been left to his own devices in chechnya " russia was dealing with the devil when it came to chechnya , " said wilson .
" clearly kadyrov is a leader who is most problematic .
he 's running free and is a law unto himself .
he is a problem in at least two ways .
he sets a very bad example by constantly pushing the limits of what 's possible .
secondly , there has been a certain displacement effect where he has pushed radicals and his enemies out of chechnya into the neighboring republics and they of course cause trouble elsewhere . "
commentators say the kremlin is nervous that it has allowed kadyrov to accumulate too much power amid the mass withdrawal of russian servicemen after the last war .
they are also worried that kadyrov has launched a drive to islamize chechnya , with unpredictable long-term consequences .
" there is some evidence , albeit partial and contradictory , that radical islamic networks are spreading through the region , " wilson admits .
but kadyrov 's chechnya is a relative oasis of calm compared to ingushetia and dagestan .
weak , puppet leaders failing to stop bloodshed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car bombs and shootings are rife in ingushetia ingushetia , one of russia 's smallest and poorest regions , has seen such a marked increase in violence that the kremlin dismissed murat zyazikov , the unpopular president , and installed yunus-bekyevkurov as his replacement .
however , observers say that russia gave yevkurov the position but not the power and faced with an economy on life-support and a rebel movement growing in size and ambition , the new president has also failed to stem the bloodshed .
dagestan , the largest and most ethnically diverse of the three regions with a population of over 2.5 million , is also causing serious concern .
the level of violence in the region has eclipsed that of chechnya in recent months .
president mukhu aliyev , a popular choice when appointed in 2006 , has proved a weak leader , allowing islamists to step into the power vacuum .
kremlin reaping what it has sown in southern region bildunterschrift : " dagestan is really a powder keg , " oslo-based international peace research institute analyst pavel baev said .
" all kinds of fuses are burning .
the federal center has convinced itself that the chechen war is over , that the threat from the region has fallen to the degree that it is now localized but instability is growing .
it could take a major attack in moscow to force them to take the region seriously again . "
" russia is reaping what it has sown in its chechnya-ization of the region , " said wilson .
" you have leaders like kadyrov at one end of the scale , who are almost totally independent , and at the other end you have those weak , powerless leaders who are really just kremlin puppets .
in between you get this dangerous mixture of local strong men overseeing networks of corruption which are often strongly ethnicized in a region which is an ethnic melting pot . "
" this spring the situation has got worse in dagestan , in chechnya and in ingushetia , " said alexei malashenko , an expert on the region with the us-funded moscow carnegie center .
" the kremlin 's system is simply not working " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 20.06.2009 kremlin 's proxy policy exposed as unruly provinces slip toward anarchy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's power is seen but not heard in the southern provinces with moscow 's attention elsewhere in these days of financial instability , a string of high-profile assassinations in the mainly muslim provinces of southern russia is forcing the kremlin to take notice . in ingushetia last saturday , bashir aushev , the vice premier under former president murat zyazikov , was gunned down in the former regional capital of nasran .
islamist rebels are believed to be responsible for the shooting .
aushev 's death came just days after the deputy chairwoman of the country 's supreme court was shot dead on june 10 .
also last saturday , two policemen were killed in the latest resumption of fighting between rebels and pro-moscow forces in chechnya .
the officers died during a shoot-out with a group of 15 rebel fighters in a forested area near the eastern village of alkinchu-borzoi , less than two months after the kremlin 's decision in april to end a decade-long " counter-terrorist operation " in the region .
a day before that , two members of the security forces and two rebels were shot dead in separate incidents in dagestan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev expressed concern hours before another murder these killings came just hours after russian president dmitry medvedev flew with his top national security officials to dagestan for a special meeting .
medvedev 's visit followed the assassination of the region 's interior minister , adilgerei magomedtagirov , who was shot dead by a sniper in a brazen daylight attack during the wedding of a colleague 's daughter .
some analysts believe that rebel forces in these unstable regions are taking advantage of moscow 's preoccupation with issues closer to home and the perceived belief in the kremlin that as long as the instability remains localized it remains a problem for the provinces ' authorities to deal with .
but moscow is in danger of slipping into a false sense of security .
after returning stability of sorts to chechnya after two devastating wars and installing former rebel ramzan kadyrov as its proxy leader in grozny , some believe the kremlin is under the impression that the threat from the region is minimal .
moscow turns a blind-eye to southern murders " russia 's policy is one part turning a blind-eye and one part containment , " andrew wilson , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the moscow elite think that murders in the south are n't a problem .
it would only be a problem if it spilled into diaspora killings in moscow . "
" kadyrov has been testing moscow 's limits by targeting his enemies all over the globe but he has a certain license because the claim of stability in chechnya is all important to the kremlin .
for the other republics , as long as it remains local , russia lets it fester .
it 's likely that this festering will get a lot worse , " wilson said . there is a growing consensus that the unrest which is growing in these regions has much to do with the kremlin 's policy of handing control to local elites to try to stem disorder .
at the end of the second chechen war , the kremlin made a decision to effectively contract out the running of the ethnically diverse regions .
if local leaders could provide relative peace and stability , the kremlin would give them a free hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov has been left to his own devices in chechnya " russia was dealing with the devil when it came to chechnya , " said wilson .
" clearly kadyrov is a leader who is most problematic .
he 's running free and is a law unto himself .
he is a problem in at least two ways .
he sets a very bad example by constantly pushing the limits of what 's possible .
secondly , there has been a certain displacement effect where he has pushed radicals and his enemies out of chechnya into the neighboring republics and they of course cause trouble elsewhere . "
commentators say the kremlin is nervous that it has allowed kadyrov to accumulate too much power amid the mass withdrawal of russian servicemen after the last war .
they are also worried that kadyrov has launched a drive to islamize chechnya , with unpredictable long-term consequences .
" there is some evidence , albeit partial and contradictory , that radical islamic networks are spreading through the region , " wilson admits .
but kadyrov 's chechnya is a relative oasis of calm compared to ingushetia and dagestan .
weak , puppet leaders failing to stop bloodshed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car bombs and shootings are rife in ingushetia ingushetia , one of russia 's smallest and poorest regions , has seen such a marked increase in violence that the kremlin dismissed murat zyazikov , the unpopular president , and installed yunus-bekyevkurov as his replacement .
however , observers say that russia gave yevkurov the position but not the power and faced with an economy on life-support and a rebel movement growing in size and ambition , the new president has also failed to stem the bloodshed .
dagestan , the largest and most ethnically diverse of the three regions with a population of over 2.5 million , is also causing serious concern .
the level of violence in the region has eclipsed that of chechnya in recent months .
president mukhu aliyev , a popular choice when appointed in 2006 , has proved a weak leader , allowing islamists to step into the power vacuum .
kremlin reaping what it has sown in southern region bildunterschrift : " dagestan is really a powder keg , " oslo-based international peace research institute analyst pavel baev said .
" all kinds of fuses are burning .
the federal center has convinced itself that the chechen war is over , that the threat from the region has fallen to the degree that it is now localized but instability is growing .
it could take a major attack in moscow to force them to take the region seriously again . "
" russia is reaping what it has sown in its chechnya-ization of the region , " said wilson .
" you have leaders like kadyrov at one end of the scale , who are almost totally independent , and at the other end you have those weak , powerless leaders who are really just kremlin puppets .

friday evening , six candidates went head-to-head on the issues on live television from the bundestag in bonn , where previous chancellors held sway for 40 years .
in the end , the winner with the clear majority of 72.6 percent was jacob schrot . around 180,000 people participated in the vote according to zdf .
schrot is a member of the youth group of the christian democratic union or cdu , who ran on the slogan " recognize the strength of pluralism . "
among schrot 's other platform issues were his demands for more nuclear power for germany and more cooperation and less political bickering .
on the zdf web site , one can still watch the videos submitted by six finalists , who lay out their political agendas .
most of the videos are simple and grainy , and appear to have been shot almost spontaneously in a family basement .
but some did go a bit further .
one candidate , philip kalisch , 31 , who came in second place , got a friend to film him on his balcony , and is styled like a long lost member of the popular rock band kings of leon .
television 's allure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three judges weighed the candidates but the winner was chosen by viewers zdf is betting that the youth of germany might well warm to politics if it gets them on a tv casting show .
some 2,500 people between the ages of 18 and 35 submitted videos through the network 's web site .
that 's a far cry from the 30,000 who tried out for the last season of " deutschland sucht den superstar " - germany 's version of pop idol - or the mob scene that ensued in duesseldorf earlier this year when heidi klum held an open casting for " germany 's next top model . "
but producers said they thought the turnout for kanzler was good , considering it 's a show that nobody has ever seen .
from that pool of 2,500 applicants , 40 were selected to come to bonn .
there , each one made a brief speech in the old bundestag .
sizing them up was a panel of judges made up of a politician , a tv talk show host who 's interviewed quite a few politicians , and a comedy actress with experience in sending them up .
grooming candidates early the show is not really meant to find the country a future head of government .
but the exposure gained on the show , some believe , might well catapult the contestants into public roles within their chosen parties that could lead to much more in the future .
" among the 40 that we had at the audition ; " the host of the show steffen seibert said , " there were definitely at least 10 that i could see , 10 or 15 years from now , in leading positions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists gave speeches on live television from the old bundestag for the most part , however , said the politician on the panel , the former premier of the german city-state of bremen , henning scherf , the show is an attempt to make politics an exciting topic - or even a career choice - among young people .
" i hope it will embolden smart , young , engaged people to participate in the political process .
they have to have role models , and they have to have incentives , " said scherf .
" we have to strive to make sure they are convinced it 's worth their while , and arouse their curiosity - not just preach to them . "
the push to get young people involved is stepping into high gear , as germany prepares to vote for a new government on september 27 .
canadian import the show is patterned after the cbc program " canada 's next great prime minister . "
it grew up out of an essay contest , made it to the network three years ago , and ended up as a surprise hit .
for the latest edition , the fourth on the cbc , the network even lured alex trebek , superstar host of the american game show " jeopardy ! " to come back to his native canada to present the program .
the show also has some even bigger names on its panel of judges : former prime ministers brian mulroney , kim campbell , joe clark and paul martin .
the cbc has been selling the concept around the world and germany 's version is set to be followed by others in australia and britain. mrh / sjt / dpa / kna editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

television 's allure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three judges weighed the candidates but the winner was chosen by viewers zdf is betting that the youth of germany might well warm to politics if it gets them on a tv casting show .
some 2,500 people between the ages of 18 and 35 submitted videos through the network 's web site .
that 's a far cry from the 30,000 who tried out for the last season of " deutschland sucht den superstar " - germany 's version of pop idol - or the mob scene that ensued in duesseldorf earlier this year when heidi klum held an open casting for " germany 's next top model . "
but producers said they thought the turnout for kanzler was good , considering it 's a show that nobody has ever seen .
from that pool of 2,500 applicants , 40 were selected to come to bonn .
there , each one made a brief speech in the old bundestag .
sizing them up was a panel of judges made up of a politician , a tv talk show host who 's interviewed quite a few politicians , and a comedy actress with experience in sending them up .
grooming candidates early the show is not really meant to find the country a future head of government .
but the exposure gained on the show , some believe , might well catapult the contestants into public roles within their chosen parties that could lead to much more in the future .
" among the 40 that we had at the audition ; " the host of the show steffen seibert said , " there were definitely at least 10 that i could see , 10 or 15 years from now , in leading positions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists gave speeches on live television from the old bundestag for the most part , however , said the politician on the panel , the former premier of the german city-state of bremen , henning scherf , the show is an attempt to make politics an exciting topic - or even a career choice - among young people .
" i hope it will embolden smart , young , engaged people to participate in the political process .
they have to have role models , and they have to have incentives , " said scherf .
" we have to strive to make sure they are convinced it 's worth their while , and arouse their curiosity - not just preach to them . "
the push to get young people involved is stepping into high gear , as germany prepares to vote for a new government on september 27 .
canadian import the show is patterned after the cbc program " canada 's next great prime minister . "
it grew up out of an essay contest , made it to the network three years ago , and ended up as a surprise hit .
for the latest edition , the fourth on the cbc , the network even lured alex trebek , superstar host of the american game show " jeopardy ! " to come back to his native canada to present the program .
the show also has some even bigger names on its panel of judges : former prime ministers brian mulroney , kim campbell , joe clark and paul martin .
the cbc has been selling the concept around the world and germany 's version is set to be followed by others in australia and britain. mrh / sjt / dpa / kna editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 20.06.2009 kremlin 's proxy policy exposed as unruly provinces slip toward anarchy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's power is seen but not heard in the southern provinces with moscow 's attention elsewhere in these days of financial instability , a string of high-profile assassinations in the mainly muslim provinces of southern russia is forcing the kremlin to take notice . in ingushetia last saturday , bashir aushev , the vice premier under former president murat zyazikov , was gunned down in the former regional capital of nasran .
islamist rebels are believed to be responsible for the shooting .
aushev 's death came just days after the deputy chairwoman of the country 's supreme court was shot dead on june 10 .
also last saturday , two policemen were killed in the latest resumption of fighting between rebels and pro-moscow forces in chechnya .
the officers died during a shoot-out with a group of 15 rebel fighters in a forested area near the eastern village of alkinchu-borzoi , less than two months after the kremlin 's decision in april to end a decade-long " counter-terrorist operation " in the region .
a day before that , two members of the security forces and two rebels were shot dead in separate incidents in dagestan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev expressed concern hours before another murder these killings came just hours after russian president dmitry medvedev flew with his top national security officials to dagestan for a special meeting .
medvedev 's visit followed the assassination of the region 's interior minister , adilgerei magomedtagirov , who was shot dead by a sniper in a brazen daylight attack during the wedding of a colleague 's daughter .
some analysts believe that rebel forces in these unstable regions are taking advantage of moscow 's preoccupation with issues closer to home and the perceived belief in the kremlin that as long as the instability remains localized it remains a problem for the provinces ' authorities to deal with .
but moscow is in danger of slipping into a false sense of security .
after returning stability of sorts to chechnya after two devastating wars and installing former rebel ramzan kadyrov as its proxy leader in grozny , some believe the kremlin is under the impression that the threat from the region is minimal .
moscow turns a blind-eye to southern murders " russia 's policy is one part turning a blind-eye and one part containment , " andrew wilson , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the moscow elite think that murders in the south are n't a problem .
it would only be a problem if it spilled into diaspora killings in moscow . "
" kadyrov has been testing moscow 's limits by targeting his enemies all over the globe but he has a certain license because the claim of stability in chechnya is all important to the kremlin .
for the other republics , as long as it remains local , russia lets it fester .
it 's likely that this festering will get a lot worse , " wilson said . there is a growing consensus that the unrest which is growing in these regions has much to do with the kremlin 's policy of handing control to local elites to try to stem disorder .
at the end of the second chechen war , the kremlin made a decision to effectively contract out the running of the ethnically diverse regions .
if local leaders could provide relative peace and stability , the kremlin would give them a free hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov has been left to his own devices in chechnya " russia was dealing with the devil when it came to chechnya , " said wilson .
" clearly kadyrov is a leader who is most problematic .
he 's running free and is a law unto himself .
he is a problem in at least two ways .
he sets a very bad example by constantly pushing the limits of what 's possible .
secondly , there has been a certain displacement effect where he has pushed radicals and his enemies out of chechnya into the neighboring republics and they of course cause trouble elsewhere . "
commentators say the kremlin is nervous that it has allowed kadyrov to accumulate too much power amid the mass withdrawal of russian servicemen after the last war .
they are also worried that kadyrov has launched a drive to islamize chechnya , with unpredictable long-term consequences .
" there is some evidence , albeit partial and contradictory , that radical islamic networks are spreading through the region , " wilson admits .
but kadyrov 's chechnya is a relative oasis of calm compared to ingushetia and dagestan .
weak , puppet leaders failing to stop bloodshed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car bombs and shootings are rife in ingushetia ingushetia , one of russia 's smallest and poorest regions , has seen such a marked increase in violence that the kremlin dismissed murat zyazikov , the unpopular president , and installed yunus-bekyevkurov as his replacement .
however , observers say that russia gave yevkurov the position but not the power and faced with an economy on life-support and a rebel movement growing in size and ambition , the new president has also failed to stem the bloodshed .
dagestan , the largest and most ethnically diverse of the three regions with a population of over 2.5 million , is also causing serious concern .
the level of violence in the region has eclipsed that of chechnya in recent months .
president mukhu aliyev , a popular choice when appointed in 2006 , has proved a weak leader , allowing islamists to step into the power vacuum .
kremlin reaping what it has sown in southern region bildunterschrift : " dagestan is really a powder keg , " oslo-based international peace research institute analyst pavel baev said .
" all kinds of fuses are burning .
the federal center has convinced itself that the chechen war is over , that the threat from the region has fallen to the degree that it is now localized but instability is growing .
it could take a major attack in moscow to force them to take the region seriously again . "
" russia is reaping what it has sown in its chechnya-ization of the region , " said wilson .
" you have leaders like kadyrov at one end of the scale , who are almost totally independent , and at the other end you have those weak , powerless leaders who are really just kremlin puppets .
in between you get this dangerous mixture of local strong men overseeing networks of corruption which are often strongly ethnicized in a region which is an ethnic melting pot . "
" this spring the situation has got worse in dagestan , in chechnya and in ingushetia , " said alexei malashenko , an expert on the region with the us-funded moscow carnegie center .
" the kremlin 's system is simply not working " .

islamist rebels are believed to be responsible for the shooting .
aushev 's death came just days after the deputy chairwoman of the country 's supreme court was shot dead on june 10 .
also last saturday , two policemen were killed in the latest resumption of fighting between rebels and pro-moscow forces in chechnya .
the officers died during a shoot-out with a group of 15 rebel fighters in a forested area near the eastern village of alkinchu-borzoi , less than two months after the kremlin 's decision in april to end a decade-long " counter-terrorist operation " in the region .
a day before that , two members of the security forces and two rebels were shot dead in separate incidents in dagestan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev expressed concern hours before another murder these killings came just hours after russian president dmitry medvedev flew with his top national security officials to dagestan for a special meeting .
medvedev 's visit followed the assassination of the region 's interior minister , adilgerei magomedtagirov , who was shot dead by a sniper in a brazen daylight attack during the wedding of a colleague 's daughter .
some analysts believe that rebel forces in these unstable regions are taking advantage of moscow 's preoccupation with issues closer to home and the perceived belief in the kremlin that as long as the instability remains localized it remains a problem for the provinces ' authorities to deal with .
but moscow is in danger of slipping into a false sense of security .
after returning stability of sorts to chechnya after two devastating wars and installing former rebel ramzan kadyrov as its proxy leader in grozny , some believe the kremlin is under the impression that the threat from the region is minimal .
moscow turns a blind-eye to southern murders " russia 's policy is one part turning a blind-eye and one part containment , " andrew wilson , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the moscow elite think that murders in the south are n't a problem .
it would only be a problem if it spilled into diaspora killings in moscow . "
" kadyrov has been testing moscow 's limits by targeting his enemies all over the globe but he has a certain license because the claim of stability in chechnya is all important to the kremlin .
for the other republics , as long as it remains local , russia lets it fester .
it 's likely that this festering will get a lot worse , " wilson said . there is a growing consensus that the unrest which is growing in these regions has much to do with the kremlin 's policy of handing control to local elites to try to stem disorder .
at the end of the second chechen war , the kremlin made a decision to effectively contract out the running of the ethnically diverse regions .
if local leaders could provide relative peace and stability , the kremlin would give them a free hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov has been left to his own devices in chechnya " russia was dealing with the devil when it came to chechnya , " said wilson .
" clearly kadyrov is a leader who is most problematic .
he 's running free and is a law unto himself .
he is a problem in at least two ways .
he sets a very bad example by constantly pushing the limits of what 's possible .
secondly , there has been a certain displacement effect where he has pushed radicals and his enemies out of chechnya into the neighboring republics and they of course cause trouble elsewhere . "
commentators say the kremlin is nervous that it has allowed kadyrov to accumulate too much power amid the mass withdrawal of russian servicemen after the last war .
they are also worried that kadyrov has launched a drive to islamize chechnya , with unpredictable long-term consequences .
" there is some evidence , albeit partial and contradictory , that radical islamic networks are spreading through the region , " wilson admits .
but kadyrov 's chechnya is a relative oasis of calm compared to ingushetia and dagestan .
weak , puppet leaders failing to stop bloodshed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car bombs and shootings are rife in ingushetia ingushetia , one of russia 's smallest and poorest regions , has seen such a marked increase in violence that the kremlin dismissed murat zyazikov , the unpopular president , and installed yunus-bekyevkurov as his replacement .
however , observers say that russia gave yevkurov the position but not the power and faced with an economy on life-support and a rebel movement growing in size and ambition , the new president has also failed to stem the bloodshed .
dagestan , the largest and most ethnically diverse of the three regions with a population of over 2.5 million , is also causing serious concern .
the level of violence in the region has eclipsed that of chechnya in recent months .
president mukhu aliyev , a popular choice when appointed in 2006 , has proved a weak leader , allowing islamists to step into the power vacuum .

islamist rebels are believed to be responsible for the shooting .
aushev 's death came just days after the deputy chairwoman of the country 's supreme court was shot dead on june 10 .
also last saturday , two policemen were killed in the latest resumption of fighting between rebels and pro-moscow forces in chechnya .
the officers died during a shoot-out with a group of 15 rebel fighters in a forested area near the eastern village of alkinchu-borzoi , less than two months after the kremlin 's decision in april to end a decade-long " counter-terrorist operation " in the region .
a day before that , two members of the security forces and two rebels were shot dead in separate incidents in dagestan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev expressed concern hours before another murder these killings came just hours after russian president dmitry medvedev flew with his top national security officials to dagestan for a special meeting .
medvedev 's visit followed the assassination of the region 's interior minister , adilgerei magomedtagirov , who was shot dead by a sniper in a brazen daylight attack during the wedding of a colleague 's daughter .
some analysts believe that rebel forces in these unstable regions are taking advantage of moscow 's preoccupation with issues closer to home and the perceived belief in the kremlin that as long as the instability remains localized it remains a problem for the provinces ' authorities to deal with .
but moscow is in danger of slipping into a false sense of security .
after returning stability of sorts to chechnya after two devastating wars and installing former rebel ramzan kadyrov as its proxy leader in grozny , some believe the kremlin is under the impression that the threat from the region is minimal .
moscow turns a blind-eye to southern murders " russia 's policy is one part turning a blind-eye and one part containment , " andrew wilson , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the moscow elite think that murders in the south are n't a problem .
it would only be a problem if it spilled into diaspora killings in moscow . "
" kadyrov has been testing moscow 's limits by targeting his enemies all over the globe but he has a certain license because the claim of stability in chechnya is all important to the kremlin .
for the other republics , as long as it remains local , russia lets it fester .
it 's likely that this festering will get a lot worse , " wilson said . there is a growing consensus that the unrest which is growing in these regions has much to do with the kremlin 's policy of handing control to local elites to try to stem disorder .
at the end of the second chechen war , the kremlin made a decision to effectively contract out the running of the ethnically diverse regions .
if local leaders could provide relative peace and stability , the kremlin would give them a free hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov has been left to his own devices in chechnya " russia was dealing with the devil when it came to chechnya , " said wilson .
" clearly kadyrov is a leader who is most problematic .
he 's running free and is a law unto himself .
he is a problem in at least two ways .
he sets a very bad example by constantly pushing the limits of what 's possible .
secondly , there has been a certain displacement effect where he has pushed radicals and his enemies out of chechnya into the neighboring republics and they of course cause trouble elsewhere . "
commentators say the kremlin is nervous that it has allowed kadyrov to accumulate too much power amid the mass withdrawal of russian servicemen after the last war .
they are also worried that kadyrov has launched a drive to islamize chechnya , with unpredictable long-term consequences .
" there is some evidence , albeit partial and contradictory , that radical islamic networks are spreading through the region , " wilson admits .
but kadyrov 's chechnya is a relative oasis of calm compared to ingushetia and dagestan .
weak , puppet leaders failing to stop bloodshed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car bombs and shootings are rife in ingushetia ingushetia , one of russia 's smallest and poorest regions , has seen such a marked increase in violence that the kremlin dismissed murat zyazikov , the unpopular president , and installed yunus-bekyevkurov as his replacement .
however , observers say that russia gave yevkurov the position but not the power and faced with an economy on life-support and a rebel movement growing in size and ambition , the new president has also failed to stem the bloodshed .
dagestan , the largest and most ethnically diverse of the three regions with a population of over 2.5 million , is also causing serious concern .
the level of violence in the region has eclipsed that of chechnya in recent months .
president mukhu aliyev , a popular choice when appointed in 2006 , has proved a weak leader , allowing islamists to step into the power vacuum .
kremlin reaping what it has sown in southern region bildunterschrift : " dagestan is really a powder keg , " oslo-based international peace research institute analyst pavel baev said .
" all kinds of fuses are burning .
the federal center has convinced itself that the chechen war is over , that the threat from the region has fallen to the degree that it is now localized but instability is growing .
it could take a major attack in moscow to force them to take the region seriously again . "
" russia is reaping what it has sown in its chechnya-ization of the region , " said wilson .
" you have leaders like kadyrov at one end of the scale , who are almost totally independent , and at the other end you have those weak , powerless leaders who are really just kremlin puppets .
in between you get this dangerous mixture of local strong men overseeing networks of corruption which are often strongly ethnicized in a region which is an ethnic melting pot . "
" this spring the situation has got worse in dagestan , in chechnya and in ingushetia , " said alexei malashenko , an expert on the region with the us-funded moscow carnegie center .
" the kremlin 's system is simply not working " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 20.06.2009 switch from oil to biomass wo n't happen overnight , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enthusiasm for biomass is high right now dw talked to franz fischler , the eu 's commissioner for agriculture from 1999 to 2004 , about the biomass boom and whether it 's a way out of the global energy crisis . deutsche welle : biomass is considered to be an important building block for securing future energy supplies .
how would you assess the potential there for europe and the rest of the world ? franz fischler : i think that biomass should n't only be seen as the raw material for energy supply , but more broadly as a renewable material .
it can , for example , replace metals or other raw materials - not just oil or gas .
the potential is fairly large , but is also limited .
no one should think that we can just switch from an oil-based to a biomass-based economy right now . the potential is particularly limited when we 're dealing with fuel - also because there 's one thing that can not be questioned : that feeding the world has to have a higher priority than producing or using biomass for energy purposes . five percent of food resources globally are used in the production of biofuels .
at the same time , millions of people are starving .
is it reasonable to use agricultural land for the production of biomass and biofuels ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz fischler i think that you ca n't give a generalized answer to that .
there are situations in which production of energy crops could definitely make sense .
but as i said , these are not all that relevant .
the eu 's goal of meeting 10 percent of fuel consumption with biomass depends on second-generation biofuel - in other words , when bioethanol is no longer made from grain but from straw . heat , electricity and fuel can be produced with biomass .
what use do you feel is most promising ? i 'm an advocate of what 's known as " cascade utilization " of biomass .
in my opinion , biomass is much too valuable to just burn it or make biogas out of .
i think that the various components that biomass is made from have to be used separately .
and you ca n't forget that biomass offers a reservoir of chemicals that first have to be removed .
the next step is then to make fuel from the cellulose - that is , the straw or grass - but a lot more research is necessary .
only what 's left over should be burned .
the same is true for wood . how do you feel about the balance between food production and energy production ? i feel that without a doubt , food production needs to take priority .
but we should n't forget that there are also grain and other biomass products ill-suited to human consumption that we can use with a clear ethical conscience . should there be international or eu regulation ? the eu will have to revise its targets according to how successfully second-generation biofuels are adopted .
one thing is clear : the 10-percent target wo n't be reached with first-generation biofuels . what does production of biomass mean for rural areas and ultimately , developing countries ? if you consider biomass in a broader context and not only in the context of its use as fuel , then it is apparent that it provides ample opportunities for provision of decentralized energy .
the guessing region in austria , for example , is autonomous in its energy production .
in this case , fuel provision plays a minor role .
the focus is on using wood waste and straw as energy and producing various chemicals from biomass . it 's still early days for modern bioenergy use .
are the conditions for sensible use of bioenergy and research in the area helping maximize its potential and leading to its sustainability ? there is intensive research going on and these questions are the focus of the eu 's current research program , but we are still a long way from reaching our targets .
liquefaction of biogas and the use of straw and wood waste and cellulose , for example , are still far from viable options .
the challenge is not only one of technology but also of environmental relevance . what role does the eu play in the development of these technologies ? on the one hand , the eu funds research and development , although only in response to applications - it does n't commission r & d. on the other hand , it funds investments in production , especially in the area of rural development .
what it does n't do is directly subsidize production .
it used to , but stopped because of the " health checks . "
the concept of obligatory land set aside was also done away with .
the eu has turned away from its policy of larger subsidies for grain for energy production than grain for food production . in march 2009 , the eu drew up sustainability criteria for use of biomass .
can you tell us what they are ? these are still only draft criteria , based on the principle that standards need to be introduced to determine what kind of greenhouse gas savings should be achieved by sustainable biomass .
there are diverging opinions on what the lowest level of carbon emissions should be .
for biofuels , the european commission 's requirement was for a 30-percent savings , but a 50-percent savings appears to be a more likely target . how important will biomass be by the mid-21st century ? a lot more important than it is now .
the more innovation we see , the more important it will become . franz fischler is the chairman of the eco-social forum austria for the development of bioenergy . interview : gero reuter -lrb- jp -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

how would you assess the potential there for europe and the rest of the world ? franz fischler : i think that biomass should n't only be seen as the raw material for energy supply , but more broadly as a renewable material .
it can , for example , replace metals or other raw materials - not just oil or gas .
the potential is fairly large , but is also limited .
no one should think that we can just switch from an oil-based to a biomass-based economy right now . the potential is particularly limited when we 're dealing with fuel - also because there 's one thing that can not be questioned : that feeding the world has to have a higher priority than producing or using biomass for energy purposes . five percent of food resources globally are used in the production of biofuels .
at the same time , millions of people are starving .
is it reasonable to use agricultural land for the production of biomass and biofuels ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz fischler i think that you ca n't give a generalized answer to that .
there are situations in which production of energy crops could definitely make sense .
but as i said , these are not all that relevant .
the eu 's goal of meeting 10 percent of fuel consumption with biomass depends on second-generation biofuel - in other words , when bioethanol is no longer made from grain but from straw . heat , electricity and fuel can be produced with biomass .
what use do you feel is most promising ? i 'm an advocate of what 's known as " cascade utilization " of biomass .
in my opinion , biomass is much too valuable to just burn it or make biogas out of .
i think that the various components that biomass is made from have to be used separately .
and you ca n't forget that biomass offers a reservoir of chemicals that first have to be removed .
the next step is then to make fuel from the cellulose - that is , the straw or grass - but a lot more research is necessary .
only what 's left over should be burned .
the same is true for wood . how do you feel about the balance between food production and energy production ? i feel that without a doubt , food production needs to take priority .
but we should n't forget that there are also grain and other biomass products ill-suited to human consumption that we can use with a clear ethical conscience . should there be international or eu regulation ? the eu will have to revise its targets according to how successfully second-generation biofuels are adopted .
one thing is clear : the 10-percent target wo n't be reached with first-generation biofuels . what does production of biomass mean for rural areas and ultimately , developing countries ? if you consider biomass in a broader context and not only in the context of its use as fuel , then it is apparent that it provides ample opportunities for provision of decentralized energy .
the guessing region in austria , for example , is autonomous in its energy production .

one thing is clear : the 10-percent target wo n't be reached with first-generation biofuels . what does production of biomass mean for rural areas and ultimately , developing countries ? if you consider biomass in a broader context and not only in the context of its use as fuel , then it is apparent that it provides ample opportunities for provision of decentralized energy .
the guessing region in austria , for example , is autonomous in its energy production .
in this case , fuel provision plays a minor role .
the focus is on using wood waste and straw as energy and producing various chemicals from biomass . it 's still early days for modern bioenergy use .
are the conditions for sensible use of bioenergy and research in the area helping maximize its potential and leading to its sustainability ? there is intensive research going on and these questions are the focus of the eu 's current research program , but we are still a long way from reaching our targets .
liquefaction of biogas and the use of straw and wood waste and cellulose , for example , are still far from viable options .
the challenge is not only one of technology but also of environmental relevance . what role does the eu play in the development of these technologies ? on the one hand , the eu funds research and development , although only in response to applications - it does n't commission r & d. on the other hand , it funds investments in production , especially in the area of rural development .
what it does n't do is directly subsidize production .
it used to , but stopped because of the " health checks . "
the concept of obligatory land set aside was also done away with .
the eu has turned away from its policy of larger subsidies for grain for energy production than grain for food production . in march 2009 , the eu drew up sustainability criteria for use of biomass .
can you tell us what they are ? these are still only draft criteria , based on the principle that standards need to be introduced to determine what kind of greenhouse gas savings should be achieved by sustainable biomass .
there are diverging opinions on what the lowest level of carbon emissions should be .
for biofuels , the european commission 's requirement was for a 30-percent savings , but a 50-percent savings appears to be a more likely target . how important will biomass be by the mid-21st century ? a lot more important than it is now .
the more innovation we see , the more important it will become . franz fischler is the chairman of the eco-social forum austria for the development of bioenergy . interview : gero reuter -lrb- jp -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministry 's provisional figures indicate almost a doubling of new borrowings next year to 86 billion euros , compared to the 47.6 billion euros adopted on friday in a supplementary budget for 2009 .
new borrowings , to plug the gap between public expenditure versus revenues , are already at a post-war record .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes " illusory " , says finance minister steinbrueck in the bundestag parliament , finance minister peer steinbrueck said the sharp recession and stimulus packages recently enacted by chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government , had led inevitably to a combination of falling tax revenues and higher borrowings .
calls by some to lower taxes were " illusory " , he added .
ahead of germany 's federal election in september , several opposition parties slammed the latest projections .
liberal free democrat party spokesman jürgen koppelin said germany was financially worse off than at the beginning of merkel 's coalition in 2005 - despite efforts in recent years to consolidate budgets . koppelin demanded a cash audit straight after the election and rigorous re-examination of all expenditures .
the greens ' budgetary expert alexander bonde said the projected 86 billion euro gap in projected new borrowings was a " fatal " development .
by 2013 , he added , total government debt would be much higher .
ministry projections to be presented to merkel 's cabinet next week show new state borrowings for 2011 of 71 billion euros and 59 billion euros in 2012 .
total federal public expenditure next year is set to rise by eight percent to 328 billion euros but then decline somewhat by 2013 to 313 billion euros .
next year 's biggest spender will be the federal ministry of labour and social affairs , representing half of the overall budget .
its spending includes funding for germany 's 3.5 million unemployed and 1.2 million workers on so-called kurzarbeit , subsidised shortened working hours .
the european commission , which monitors the deficits of european union countries , has forecast that many member nations will breach budgetary limits in 2009 and 2010 .
under the eu 's stability and growth pact , eurozone governments are not supposed to run up deficits beyond three percent of each country 's gross domestic product or gdp .
last wednesday , steinbrueck said german public debt this year would probably reach 4.4 percent of gdp. ipj / reuters / afp / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany ’ s pop music industry has canceled its most important annual trade fair .
popkomm organizers blame a decline in potential exhibitors on the recession and on-line piracy . popkomm , germany 's annual trade fair that normally showcases the pop music industry and youth entertainment trends in berlin and abroad has been canceled for this year .
dieter gorny , who initiated popkomm , originally in cologne , said unpaid music downloads by internet users had left companies struggling . gorny blamed politicians , saying the exhibition 's cancellation was the result of their inaction on piracy .
they had failed to grasp its serious impact , said gorny , who heads of the german bvmi music industry association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music manager dieter gorny " the digital crisis has hit the music industry head on .
losing revenues to illegal downloads on the internet , many companies can simply no longer afford to participate at popkomm . "
if legislative action was not taken soon all efforts by the music industry would fail to bear fruit , said gorny .
the bvmi says that for every legally purchased download in germany , eight others are pirated .
visitor numbers down popkomm organizers decided to cancel the fair , saying an anticipated 50 percent drop in visitor numbers for this year would have made it impossible to keep the event on a sound professional footing . although popkomm 2008 attracted 842 exhibitors from 52 countries , plus 14,000 industry participants , overall visitor numbers had already dropped by 20 percent ..
popkomm chief ralf kleinhenz said there had been a lot of positive feedback after the event was shifted from cologne to berlin back in 2004 .
but this year there were simply not enough exhibitor and visitor registrations to guarantee a successful event for 2009 .
it had been scheduled to take place in mid-september .
aside from the exhibition , the organizers have also called off the pop music festival that usually adds zest to business transactions at the trade fair .
popkomm organizers say they are working on a new concept for the next trade fair in 2010 .
there will be a sharper focus on networking between participants , as well as a conference and more attractive public events. ipj / dpa / ap editor : greg benzow send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 'm very concerned based on some of the tenor and tone of the statements that have been made that the government of iran recognizes that the world is watching , " obama told cbs news .
" and how they approach and deal with people who are , through peaceful means , trying to be heard will , i think , send a pretty clear signal to the international community about what iran is and - and is not . "
asked whether he had a message to the demonstrators , obama replied " i absolutely do . "
" we stand behind those who are seeking justice in a peaceful way , ” obama said .
" we stand with those who would look to peaceful resolution of conflict and we believe that the voices of people have to be heard . "
obama rejects tehran 's claims of intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran says the us has stirred up the protesters the president also attempted to debunk claims by some in the iranian leadership that the opposition demonstrators were acting at the behest of the united states , which has had a long history of antagonism with iran .
tehran , with which washington severed ties shortly after iran 's 1979 islamic revolution , has already accused the united states of " interventionist " statements on the election .
" let 's understand that this notion that somehow these hundreds of thousands of people , who are pouring into the streets in iran , are somehow responding to the west or the united states .
that 's an old distraction that i think has been trotted out periodically .
and that 's just not going to fly . "
obama also said washington must be careful not to become " a foil for those forces inside iran who would love nothing better than to make this an argument about the united states .
that 's what they do .
that 's what we 're already seeing .
we should n't be playing into that . "
obama has been less critical of the election than many european leaders to avoid being accused of meddling in the election and potentially triggering a backlash against the demonstrators just as his administration seeks to engage tehran over its nuclear program .
us officials keen to keep out of developing crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us does n't want to give iran any more ammunition senior us officials earlier stressed that washington was making strenuous efforts to avoid being drawn into the crisis in a way that could be used by the government against the demonstrators .
" the more the united states looks like they are going to interfere , the more it is going to be detrimental , " said one official on condition of anonymity .
" this is not about us . "
despite assurances by top officials that washington would not inject itself into the crisis , both houses of the us congress voted to condemn violence against demonstrators by the government of iran the house resolution , which passed by 405 votes to one , expressed " its support for all iranian citizens who embrace the values of freedom , human rights , civil liberties , and rule of law . "
it also " condemns the ongoing violence against demonstrators by the government of iran and pro-government militias , as well as the ongoing government suppression of independent electronic communication through interference with the internet and cell phones . "
democrat howard berman , chairman of the house foreign affairs committee , said the bill was not a " judgment on who won the iranian elections . "
" it is an acknowledgement that we can not remain silent when cherished , universal principles are under attack . "
critics want harder tone from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain is among those who want a harder tone on friday , senator john mccain told reuters the iranian election was " corrupt " and urged obama to speak out more forcefully on behalf of the demonstrators .
" i 'm not saying send arms to them , i 'm not saying they should foment revolution , i 'm not saying they should do anything but hear that the united states of america supports their assertion of their basic human rights , " said mccain , who lost to obama in last year 's us presidential election .
iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said on friday that last week 's election was won fairly by president mahmoud ahmadinejad and not rigged , as defeated candidate mirhossein mousavi alleges .
khamenei warned protest leaders they would be responsible for any further bloodshed. nda / afp / reuters / ap editor : greg benzow send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" let 's understand that this notion that somehow these hundreds of thousands of people , who are pouring into the streets in iran , are somehow responding to the west or the united states .
that 's an old distraction that i think has been trotted out periodically .
and that 's just not going to fly . "
obama also said washington must be careful not to become " a foil for those forces inside iran who would love nothing better than to make this an argument about the united states .
that 's what they do .
that 's what we 're already seeing .
we should n't be playing into that . "
obama has been less critical of the election than many european leaders to avoid being accused of meddling in the election and potentially triggering a backlash against the demonstrators just as his administration seeks to engage tehran over its nuclear program .
us officials keen to keep out of developing crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us does n't want to give iran any more ammunition senior us officials earlier stressed that washington was making strenuous efforts to avoid being drawn into the crisis in a way that could be used by the government against the demonstrators .
" the more the united states looks like they are going to interfere , the more it is going to be detrimental , " said one official on condition of anonymity .
" this is not about us . "
despite assurances by top officials that washington would not inject itself into the crisis , both houses of the us congress voted to condemn violence against demonstrators by the government of iran the house resolution , which passed by 405 votes to one , expressed " its support for all iranian citizens who embrace the values of freedom , human rights , civil liberties , and rule of law . "
it also " condemns the ongoing violence against demonstrators by the government of iran and pro-government militias , as well as the ongoing government suppression of independent electronic communication through interference with the internet and cell phones . "
democrat howard berman , chairman of the house foreign affairs committee , said the bill was not a " judgment on who won the iranian elections . "
" it is an acknowledgement that we can not remain silent when cherished , universal principles are under attack . "
critics want harder tone from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain is among those who want a harder tone on friday , senator john mccain told reuters the iranian election was " corrupt " and urged obama to speak out more forcefully on behalf of the demonstrators .
" i 'm not saying send arms to them , i 'm not saying they should foment revolution , i 'm not saying they should do anything but hear that the united states of america supports their assertion of their basic human rights , " said mccain , who lost to obama in last year 's us presidential election .
iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said on friday that last week 's election was won fairly by president mahmoud ahmadinejad and not rigged , as defeated candidate mirhossein mousavi alleges .
khamenei warned protest leaders they would be responsible for any further bloodshed. nda / afp / reuters / ap editor : greg benzow send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

congress also assuaged the fears of foreign carmakers that the program would only apply to american-made cars .
the bill passed by congress contains no such restrictions , and means a toyota made in tokyo could be traded for a chrysler made in detroit , and vice-versa , a congressional staffer confirmed .
stefan jacoby , volkswagen of america 's president and chief executive , called the vote “ historic ” and in a statement urged us shoppers to put volkswagen 's “ fun-to-drive , fuel-efficient vehicles ” on their “ shopping list . ”
what makes a car a " clunker " ?
qualifying autos in the us will be in good driving condition , less than 25 years old , have been continuously insured in accordance with state laws and have a fuel efficiency of 18 miles per gallon -lrb- 7.65 km per liter -rrb- or less .
a qualifying car or truck will potentially be brought to a new car dealership for up to $ 4500 -lrb- 3200 euros -rrb- in a tax free voucher which will be applied toward the sale or lease price of the new vehicle , which must have a fuel efficiency of at least 22 mpg .

luxury and higher end vehicles in europe have seen little or no results from the cash-for-clunkers program , whereas more economic brands such as hyundai have seen growth .

us defense officials confirmed that the ship was being monitored and said that the north korean ship was one of a group of vessels previously linked to illicit missile-related cargo .
defense sources have yet to indicate if , or when , they might ask to search the vessel under the un security council resolution , which bans shipments of arms and nuclear or missile technology to and from north korea .
the north koreans are expected to reject any such request .
but at some point , the ship will likely need to stop for refueling along the chinese coast or elsewhere , officials said .
at that point , the country where the ship enters port is obliged under the un resolution to search the vessel if there are grounds for suspicion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us navy ships are patrolling for resolution-busting vessels pentagon officials declined to comment on a television report that the navy destroyer was heading to intercept the north korean vessel .
the officials stressed that the un sanctions do not authorize military force and that washington was pursuing a diplomatic strategy .
tensions on the korean peninsula have been running high since pyongyang carried out its second nuclear test last month .
after the underground test and subsequent missile launches , the un security council adopted a resolution last week that includes financial sanctions designed to choke off revenue to the regime .

however , us military officials say they have no indication that north korean missile technology has improved markedly since past failed launches , and military and other assessments suggest the communist nation probably could not hit the westernmost us state if it tried .
the north 's taepodong-2 could travel that far in theory , if it works as designed .

the us-china talks will be the latest in a flurry of international discussions which most recently included the meeting of european leaders to discuss north korea , the un resolution and increasing eu sanctions on friday .
eu agrees on fresh sanctions in a statement , the council of eu heads of state and government " insists on the importance of a swift and efficient implementation of all these measures " adopted by the un security council last week .
the fresh sanctions include a ban on shipments of arms and nuclear and missile technology to and from north korea .
the eu summit statement , issued after two days of talks between european leaders , condemned the recent nuclear and ballistic missile tests in the isolated communist state .
the leaders called on the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , to " transpose this resolution in a robust way and without delay in order to reinforce coercive measures aimed at the north korean leaders and entities linked to them . "

us defense officials confirmed that the ship was being monitored and said that the north korean ship was one of a group of vessels previously linked to illicit missile-related cargo .
defense sources have yet to indicate if , or when , they might ask to search the vessel under the un security council resolution , which bans shipments of arms and nuclear or missile technology to and from north korea .
the north koreans are expected to reject any such request .
but at some point , the ship will likely need to stop for refueling along the chinese coast or elsewhere , officials said .
at that point , the country where the ship enters port is obliged under the un resolution to search the vessel if there are grounds for suspicion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us navy ships are patrolling for resolution-busting vessels pentagon officials declined to comment on a television report that the navy destroyer was heading to intercept the north korean vessel .
the officials stressed that the un sanctions do not authorize military force and that washington was pursuing a diplomatic strategy .
tensions on the korean peninsula have been running high since pyongyang carried out its second nuclear test last month .
after the underground test and subsequent missile launches , the un security council adopted a resolution last week that includes financial sanctions designed to choke off revenue to the regime .
hawaii on alert in other developments , the us military has moved to beef up missile defenses in hawaii over fears pyongyang may launch a rocket over the pacific .

friday evening , six candidates went head-to-head on the issues on live television from the bundestag in bonn , where previous chancellors held sway for 40 years .
in the end , the winner with the clear majority of 72.6 percent was jacob schrot . around 180,000 people participated in the vote according to zdf .
schrot is a member of the youth group of the christian democratic union or cdu , who ran on the slogan " recognize the strength of pluralism . "
among schrot 's other platform issues were his demands for more nuclear power for germany and more cooperation and less political bickering .
on the zdf web site , one can still watch the videos submitted by six finalists , who lay out their political agendas .
most of the videos are simple and grainy , and appear to have been shot almost spontaneously in a family basement .
but some did go a bit further .

some 2,500 people between the ages of 18 and 35 submitted videos through the network 's web site .
that 's a far cry from the 30,000 who tried out for the last season of " deutschland sucht den superstar " - germany 's version of pop idol - or the mob scene that ensued in duesseldorf earlier this year when heidi klum held an open casting for " germany 's next top model . "
but producers said they thought the turnout for kanzler was good , considering it 's a show that nobody has ever seen .
from that pool of 2,500 applicants , 40 were selected to come to bonn .
there , each one made a brief speech in the old bundestag .
sizing them up was a panel of judges made up of a politician , a tv talk show host who 's interviewed quite a few politicians , and a comedy actress with experience in sending them up .
grooming candidates early the show is not really meant to find the country a future head of government .
but the exposure gained on the show , some believe , might well catapult the contestants into public roles within their chosen parties that could lead to much more in the future .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists gave speeches on live television from the old bundestag for the most part , however , said the politician on the panel , the former premier of the german city-state of bremen , henning scherf , the show is an attempt to make politics an exciting topic - or even a career choice - among young people .
" i hope it will embolden smart , young , engaged people to participate in the political process .
they have to have role models , and they have to have incentives , " said scherf .
" we have to strive to make sure they are convinced it 's worth their while , and arouse their curiosity - not just preach to them . "

friday evening , six candidates went head-to-head on the issues on live television from the bundestag in bonn , where previous chancellors held sway for 40 years .
in the end , the winner with the clear majority of 72.6 percent was jacob schrot . around 180,000 people participated in the vote according to zdf .
schrot is a member of the youth group of the christian democratic union or cdu , who ran on the slogan " recognize the strength of pluralism . "
among schrot 's other platform issues were his demands for more nuclear power for germany and more cooperation and less political bickering .
on the zdf web site , one can still watch the videos submitted by six finalists , who lay out their political agendas .
most of the videos are simple and grainy , and appear to have been shot almost spontaneously in a family basement .
but some did go a bit further .
one candidate , philip kalisch , 31 , who came in second place , got a friend to film him on his balcony , and is styled like a long lost member of the popular rock band kings of leon .
television 's allure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three judges weighed the candidates but the winner was chosen by viewers zdf is betting that the youth of germany might well warm to politics if it gets them on a tv casting show .
some 2,500 people between the ages of 18 and 35 submitted videos through the network 's web site .
that 's a far cry from the 30,000 who tried out for the last season of " deutschland sucht den superstar " - germany 's version of pop idol - or the mob scene that ensued in duesseldorf earlier this year when heidi klum held an open casting for " germany 's next top model . "
but producers said they thought the turnout for kanzler was good , considering it 's a show that nobody has ever seen .
from that pool of 2,500 applicants , 40 were selected to come to bonn .
there , each one made a brief speech in the old bundestag .
sizing them up was a panel of judges made up of a politician , a tv talk show host who 's interviewed quite a few politicians , and a comedy actress with experience in sending them up .
grooming candidates early the show is not really meant to find the country a future head of government .
but the exposure gained on the show , some believe , might well catapult the contestants into public roles within their chosen parties that could lead to much more in the future .
" among the 40 that we had at the audition ; " the host of the show steffen seibert said , " there were definitely at least 10 that i could see , 10 or 15 years from now , in leading positions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists gave speeches on live television from the old bundestag for the most part , however , said the politician on the panel , the former premier of the german city-state of bremen , henning scherf , the show is an attempt to make politics an exciting topic - or even a career choice - among young people .
" i hope it will embolden smart , young , engaged people to participate in the political process .
they have to have role models , and they have to have incentives , " said scherf .
" we have to strive to make sure they are convinced it 's worth their while , and arouse their curiosity - not just preach to them . "
the push to get young people involved is stepping into high gear , as germany prepares to vote for a new government on september 27 .
canadian import the show is patterned after the cbc program " canada 's next great prime minister . "
it grew up out of an essay contest , made it to the network three years ago , and ended up as a surprise hit .
for the latest edition , the fourth on the cbc , the network even lured alex trebek , superstar host of the american game show " jeopardy ! " to come back to his native canada to present the program .
the show also has some even bigger names on its panel of judges : former prime ministers brian mulroney , kim campbell , joe clark and paul martin .
the cbc has been selling the concept around the world and germany 's version is set to be followed by others in australia and britain. mrh / sjt / dpa / kna editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

near enqelab square in the center of the iranian capital massed security forces had responded with force , using teargas and batons , to disperse several thousand protestors - fewer than the hundreds of thousands who had gathered earlier in the week .
but at nightfall rooftop protests with cries of allahu akbar -lrb- god is greatest -rrb- were heard for hours - reportedly from supporters of the moderate opposition leader mirhossein mousavi - in what observers say is an echo of tactics used in the 1979 islamic revolution against the-then shah .
mousavi and another ostensibly defeated candidate mehdi karoubi had not summoned their followers onto the streets .
apparent bombing at mausoleum police appeared to confirm reports that a suicide bomber had detonated his device at the mausoleum of the father of iran 's islamic revolution , the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini .
a television channel , press tv , said the bomber was killed and three others were wounded .
another witness , quoted by reuters , said supporters of mousavi had set fire to a building in southern tehran , reportedly used by basij , a paramiltiary force of the government of president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
three busloads of basij islamic militia and trucks carrying motorcycles used by the paramilitaries were sighted heading for the capital .
unverified footage on the internet showed crowds running away from police lines , several apparently wounded persons and burning vehicles .
riot police reportedly fired shots into the air .
there were no confirmations of casualties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad and rival candidate hossein mousavi opposition candidate mousavi calls for election re-run mousavi in a newsletter posted on a website continued to defy ruling ayatollah ali khamenei .
mousavi reiterated demands for annulment of the june 12 election .
he cited what he called a " huge volume of cheating and changing of votes , " asserting this had been " planned in advance , " and said the ballots should be examined by a " reliable committee . "
he added that he and his supporters were not against the islamic system but just wanted to reform it by " peaceful means . "
witnesses said he also called for a national strike if he was arrested .
since last week scores of reformists have been detained and authorities have cracked down on foreign and domestic media .
at friday prayers , khamenei had ruled out any electoral fraud , saying ahmadinejad had been re-elected by a margin of 11 million votes , and warned protestors of repercussions .
on saturday iran 's powerful 12-man guardian council said it was ready for a random recount of 10 percent of the ballot boxes in response to complaints by mousavi and two other candidates .
the council had invited mousavi , another candidate mehdi karoubi and a third hopeful to a special meeting .
a council spokesman said only the conservative mohsen rezaie , who is a former revolutionary guard , had attended that meeting .

mousavi reiterated demands for annulment of the june 12 election .
he cited what he called a " huge volume of cheating and changing of votes , " asserting this had been " planned in advance , " and said the ballots should be examined by a " reliable committee . "
he added that he and his supporters were not against the islamic system but just wanted to reform it by " peaceful means . "
witnesses said he also called for a national strike if he was arrested .
since last week scores of reformists have been detained and authorities have cracked down on foreign and domestic media .
at friday prayers , khamenei had ruled out any electoral fraud , saying ahmadinejad had been re-elected by a margin of 11 million votes , and warned protestors of repercussions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 20.06.2009 kremlin 's proxy policy exposed as unruly provinces slip toward anarchy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's power is seen but not heard in the southern provinces with moscow 's attention elsewhere in these days of financial instability , a string of high-profile assassinations in the mainly muslim provinces of southern russia is forcing the kremlin to take notice . in ingushetia last saturday , bashir aushev , the vice premier under former president murat zyazikov , was gunned down in the former regional capital of nasran .
islamist rebels are believed to be responsible for the shooting .
aushev 's death came just days after the deputy chairwoman of the country 's supreme court was shot dead on june 10 .
also last saturday , two policemen were killed in the latest resumption of fighting between rebels and pro-moscow forces in chechnya .
the officers died during a shoot-out with a group of 15 rebel fighters in a forested area near the eastern village of alkinchu-borzoi , less than two months after the kremlin 's decision in april to end a decade-long " counter-terrorist operation " in the region .
a day before that , two members of the security forces and two rebels were shot dead in separate incidents in dagestan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev expressed concern hours before another murder these killings came just hours after russian president dmitry medvedev flew with his top national security officials to dagestan for a special meeting .
medvedev 's visit followed the assassination of the region 's interior minister , adilgerei magomedtagirov , who was shot dead by a sniper in a brazen daylight attack during the wedding of a colleague 's daughter .
some analysts believe that rebel forces in these unstable regions are taking advantage of moscow 's preoccupation with issues closer to home and the perceived belief in the kremlin that as long as the instability remains localized it remains a problem for the provinces ' authorities to deal with .
but moscow is in danger of slipping into a false sense of security .
after returning stability of sorts to chechnya after two devastating wars and installing former rebel ramzan kadyrov as its proxy leader in grozny , some believe the kremlin is under the impression that the threat from the region is minimal .
moscow turns a blind-eye to southern murders " russia 's policy is one part turning a blind-eye and one part containment , " andrew wilson , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the moscow elite think that murders in the south are n't a problem .
it would only be a problem if it spilled into diaspora killings in moscow . "
" kadyrov has been testing moscow 's limits by targeting his enemies all over the globe but he has a certain license because the claim of stability in chechnya is all important to the kremlin .
for the other republics , as long as it remains local , russia lets it fester .
it 's likely that this festering will get a lot worse , " wilson said . there is a growing consensus that the unrest which is growing in these regions has much to do with the kremlin 's policy of handing control to local elites to try to stem disorder .
at the end of the second chechen war , the kremlin made a decision to effectively contract out the running of the ethnically diverse regions .
if local leaders could provide relative peace and stability , the kremlin would give them a free hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov has been left to his own devices in chechnya " russia was dealing with the devil when it came to chechnya , " said wilson .
" clearly kadyrov is a leader who is most problematic .
he 's running free and is a law unto himself .
he is a problem in at least two ways .
he sets a very bad example by constantly pushing the limits of what 's possible .
secondly , there has been a certain displacement effect where he has pushed radicals and his enemies out of chechnya into the neighboring republics and they of course cause trouble elsewhere . "
commentators say the kremlin is nervous that it has allowed kadyrov to accumulate too much power amid the mass withdrawal of russian servicemen after the last war .
they are also worried that kadyrov has launched a drive to islamize chechnya , with unpredictable long-term consequences .
" there is some evidence , albeit partial and contradictory , that radical islamic networks are spreading through the region , " wilson admits .
but kadyrov 's chechnya is a relative oasis of calm compared to ingushetia and dagestan .
weak , puppet leaders failing to stop bloodshed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car bombs and shootings are rife in ingushetia ingushetia , one of russia 's smallest and poorest regions , has seen such a marked increase in violence that the kremlin dismissed murat zyazikov , the unpopular president , and installed yunus-bekyevkurov as his replacement .
however , observers say that russia gave yevkurov the position but not the power and faced with an economy on life-support and a rebel movement growing in size and ambition , the new president has also failed to stem the bloodshed .
dagestan , the largest and most ethnically diverse of the three regions with a population of over 2.5 million , is also causing serious concern .
the level of violence in the region has eclipsed that of chechnya in recent months .
president mukhu aliyev , a popular choice when appointed in 2006 , has proved a weak leader , allowing islamists to step into the power vacuum .
kremlin reaping what it has sown in southern region bildunterschrift : " dagestan is really a powder keg , " oslo-based international peace research institute analyst pavel baev said .
" all kinds of fuses are burning .
the federal center has convinced itself that the chechen war is over , that the threat from the region has fallen to the degree that it is now localized but instability is growing .
it could take a major attack in moscow to force them to take the region seriously again . "
" russia is reaping what it has sown in its chechnya-ization of the region , " said wilson .
" you have leaders like kadyrov at one end of the scale , who are almost totally independent , and at the other end you have those weak , powerless leaders who are really just kremlin puppets .
in between you get this dangerous mixture of local strong men overseeing networks of corruption which are often strongly ethnicized in a region which is an ethnic melting pot . "
" this spring the situation has got worse in dagestan , in chechnya and in ingushetia , " said alexei malashenko , an expert on the region with the us-funded moscow carnegie center .
" the kremlin 's system is simply not working " .

islamist rebels are believed to be responsible for the shooting .
aushev 's death came just days after the deputy chairwoman of the country 's supreme court was shot dead on june 10 .
also last saturday , two policemen were killed in the latest resumption of fighting between rebels and pro-moscow forces in chechnya .
the officers died during a shoot-out with a group of 15 rebel fighters in a forested area near the eastern village of alkinchu-borzoi , less than two months after the kremlin 's decision in april to end a decade-long " counter-terrorist operation " in the region .
a day before that , two members of the security forces and two rebels were shot dead in separate incidents in dagestan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev expressed concern hours before another murder these killings came just hours after russian president dmitry medvedev flew with his top national security officials to dagestan for a special meeting .
medvedev 's visit followed the assassination of the region 's interior minister , adilgerei magomedtagirov , who was shot dead by a sniper in a brazen daylight attack during the wedding of a colleague 's daughter .
some analysts believe that rebel forces in these unstable regions are taking advantage of moscow 's preoccupation with issues closer to home and the perceived belief in the kremlin that as long as the instability remains localized it remains a problem for the provinces ' authorities to deal with .
but moscow is in danger of slipping into a false sense of security .
after returning stability of sorts to chechnya after two devastating wars and installing former rebel ramzan kadyrov as its proxy leader in grozny , some believe the kremlin is under the impression that the threat from the region is minimal .
moscow turns a blind-eye to southern murders " russia 's policy is one part turning a blind-eye and one part containment , " andrew wilson , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the moscow elite think that murders in the south are n't a problem .
it would only be a problem if it spilled into diaspora killings in moscow . "
" kadyrov has been testing moscow 's limits by targeting his enemies all over the globe but he has a certain license because the claim of stability in chechnya is all important to the kremlin .
for the other republics , as long as it remains local , russia lets it fester .
it 's likely that this festering will get a lot worse , " wilson said . there is a growing consensus that the unrest which is growing in these regions has much to do with the kremlin 's policy of handing control to local elites to try to stem disorder .
at the end of the second chechen war , the kremlin made a decision to effectively contract out the running of the ethnically diverse regions .
if local leaders could provide relative peace and stability , the kremlin would give them a free hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov has been left to his own devices in chechnya " russia was dealing with the devil when it came to chechnya , " said wilson .
" clearly kadyrov is a leader who is most problematic .
he 's running free and is a law unto himself .
he is a problem in at least two ways .
he sets a very bad example by constantly pushing the limits of what 's possible .
secondly , there has been a certain displacement effect where he has pushed radicals and his enemies out of chechnya into the neighboring republics and they of course cause trouble elsewhere . "
commentators say the kremlin is nervous that it has allowed kadyrov to accumulate too much power amid the mass withdrawal of russian servicemen after the last war .
they are also worried that kadyrov has launched a drive to islamize chechnya , with unpredictable long-term consequences .
" there is some evidence , albeit partial and contradictory , that radical islamic networks are spreading through the region , " wilson admits .
but kadyrov 's chechnya is a relative oasis of calm compared to ingushetia and dagestan .
weak , puppet leaders failing to stop bloodshed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car bombs and shootings are rife in ingushetia ingushetia , one of russia 's smallest and poorest regions , has seen such a marked increase in violence that the kremlin dismissed murat zyazikov , the unpopular president , and installed yunus-bekyevkurov as his replacement .
however , observers say that russia gave yevkurov the position but not the power and faced with an economy on life-support and a rebel movement growing in size and ambition , the new president has also failed to stem the bloodshed .
dagestan , the largest and most ethnically diverse of the three regions with a population of over 2.5 million , is also causing serious concern .
the level of violence in the region has eclipsed that of chechnya in recent months .
president mukhu aliyev , a popular choice when appointed in 2006 , has proved a weak leader , allowing islamists to step into the power vacuum .
kremlin reaping what it has sown in southern region bildunterschrift : " dagestan is really a powder keg , " oslo-based international peace research institute analyst pavel baev said .
" all kinds of fuses are burning .
the federal center has convinced itself that the chechen war is over , that the threat from the region has fallen to the degree that it is now localized but instability is growing .
it could take a major attack in moscow to force them to take the region seriously again . "
" russia is reaping what it has sown in its chechnya-ization of the region , " said wilson .
" you have leaders like kadyrov at one end of the scale , who are almost totally independent , and at the other end you have those weak , powerless leaders who are really just kremlin puppets .
in between you get this dangerous mixture of local strong men overseeing networks of corruption which are often strongly ethnicized in a region which is an ethnic melting pot . "
" this spring the situation has got worse in dagestan , in chechnya and in ingushetia , " said alexei malashenko , an expert on the region with the us-funded moscow carnegie center .
" the kremlin 's system is simply not working " .

how would you assess the potential there for europe and the rest of the world ? franz fischler : i think that biomass should n't only be seen as the raw material for energy supply , but more broadly as a renewable material .
it can , for example , replace metals or other raw materials - not just oil or gas .
the potential is fairly large , but is also limited .
no one should think that we can just switch from an oil-based to a biomass-based economy right now . the potential is particularly limited when we 're dealing with fuel - also because there 's one thing that can not be questioned : that feeding the world has to have a higher priority than producing or using biomass for energy purposes . five percent of food resources globally are used in the production of biofuels .
at the same time , millions of people are starving .
is it reasonable to use agricultural land for the production of biomass and biofuels ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz fischler i think that you ca n't give a generalized answer to that .
there are situations in which production of energy crops could definitely make sense .
but as i said , these are not all that relevant .
the eu 's goal of meeting 10 percent of fuel consumption with biomass depends on second-generation biofuel - in other words , when bioethanol is no longer made from grain but from straw . heat , electricity and fuel can be produced with biomass .
what use do you feel is most promising ? i 'm an advocate of what 's known as " cascade utilization " of biomass .
in my opinion , biomass is much too valuable to just burn it or make biogas out of .
i think that the various components that biomass is made from have to be used separately .
and you ca n't forget that biomass offers a reservoir of chemicals that first have to be removed .
the next step is then to make fuel from the cellulose - that is , the straw or grass - but a lot more research is necessary .
only what 's left over should be burned .
the same is true for wood . how do you feel about the balance between food production and energy production ? i feel that without a doubt , food production needs to take priority .
but we should n't forget that there are also grain and other biomass products ill-suited to human consumption that we can use with a clear ethical conscience . should there be international or eu regulation ? the eu will have to revise its targets according to how successfully second-generation biofuels are adopted .
one thing is clear : the 10-percent target wo n't be reached with first-generation biofuels . what does production of biomass mean for rural areas and ultimately , developing countries ? if you consider biomass in a broader context and not only in the context of its use as fuel , then it is apparent that it provides ample opportunities for provision of decentralized energy .
the guessing region in austria , for example , is autonomous in its energy production .
in this case , fuel provision plays a minor role .
the focus is on using wood waste and straw as energy and producing various chemicals from biomass . it 's still early days for modern bioenergy use .
are the conditions for sensible use of bioenergy and research in the area helping maximize its potential and leading to its sustainability ? there is intensive research going on and these questions are the focus of the eu 's current research program , but we are still a long way from reaching our targets .
liquefaction of biogas and the use of straw and wood waste and cellulose , for example , are still far from viable options .
the challenge is not only one of technology but also of environmental relevance . what role does the eu play in the development of these technologies ? on the one hand , the eu funds research and development , although only in response to applications - it does n't commission r & d. on the other hand , it funds investments in production , especially in the area of rural development .
what it does n't do is directly subsidize production .
it used to , but stopped because of the " health checks . "
the concept of obligatory land set aside was also done away with .
the eu has turned away from its policy of larger subsidies for grain for energy production than grain for food production . in march 2009 , the eu drew up sustainability criteria for use of biomass .
can you tell us what they are ? these are still only draft criteria , based on the principle that standards need to be introduced to determine what kind of greenhouse gas savings should be achieved by sustainable biomass .
there are diverging opinions on what the lowest level of carbon emissions should be .
for biofuels , the european commission 's requirement was for a 30-percent savings , but a 50-percent savings appears to be a more likely target . how important will biomass be by the mid-21st century ? a lot more important than it is now .
the more innovation we see , the more important it will become . franz fischler is the chairman of the eco-social forum austria for the development of bioenergy . interview : gero reuter -lrb- jp -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the challenge is not only one of technology but also of environmental relevance . what role does the eu play in the development of these technologies ? on the one hand , the eu funds research and development , although only in response to applications - it does n't commission r & d. on the other hand , it funds investments in production , especially in the area of rural development .
what it does n't do is directly subsidize production .
it used to , but stopped because of the " health checks . "
the concept of obligatory land set aside was also done away with .
the eu has turned away from its policy of larger subsidies for grain for energy production than grain for food production . in march 2009 , the eu drew up sustainability criteria for use of biomass .
can you tell us what they are ? these are still only draft criteria , based on the principle that standards need to be introduced to determine what kind of greenhouse gas savings should be achieved by sustainable biomass .
there are diverging opinions on what the lowest level of carbon emissions should be .
for biofuels , the european commission 's requirement was for a 30-percent savings , but a 50-percent savings appears to be a more likely target . how important will biomass be by the mid-21st century ? a lot more important than it is now .
the more innovation we see , the more important it will become . franz fischler is the chairman of the eco-social forum austria for the development of bioenergy . interview : gero reuter -lrb- jp -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministry 's provisional figures indicate almost a doubling of new borrowings next year to 86 billion euros , compared to the 47.6 billion euros adopted on friday in a supplementary budget for 2009 .
new borrowings , to plug the gap between public expenditure versus revenues , are already at a post-war record .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes " illusory " , says finance minister steinbrueck in the bundestag parliament , finance minister peer steinbrueck said the sharp recession and stimulus packages recently enacted by chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government , had led inevitably to a combination of falling tax revenues and higher borrowings .
calls by some to lower taxes were " illusory " , he added .
ahead of germany 's federal election in september , several opposition parties slammed the latest projections .
liberal free democrat party spokesman jürgen koppelin said germany was financially worse off than at the beginning of merkel 's coalition in 2005 - despite efforts in recent years to consolidate budgets . koppelin demanded a cash audit straight after the election and rigorous re-examination of all expenditures .
the greens ' budgetary expert alexander bonde said the projected 86 billion euro gap in projected new borrowings was a " fatal " development .
by 2013 , he added , total government debt would be much higher .
ministry projections to be presented to merkel 's cabinet next week show new state borrowings for 2011 of 71 billion euros and 59 billion euros in 2012 .
total federal public expenditure next year is set to rise by eight percent to 328 billion euros but then decline somewhat by 2013 to 313 billion euros .
next year 's biggest spender will be the federal ministry of labour and social affairs , representing half of the overall budget .
its spending includes funding for germany 's 3.5 million unemployed and 1.2 million workers on so-called kurzarbeit , subsidised shortened working hours .
the european commission , which monitors the deficits of european union countries , has forecast that many member nations will breach budgetary limits in 2009 and 2010 .
under the eu 's stability and growth pact , eurozone governments are not supposed to run up deficits beyond three percent of each country 's gross domestic product or gdp .

the ministry 's provisional figures indicate almost a doubling of new borrowings next year to 86 billion euros , compared to the 47.6 billion euros adopted on friday in a supplementary budget for 2009 .
new borrowings , to plug the gap between public expenditure versus revenues , are already at a post-war record .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes " illusory " , says finance minister steinbrueck in the bundestag parliament , finance minister peer steinbrueck said the sharp recession and stimulus packages recently enacted by chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government , had led inevitably to a combination of falling tax revenues and higher borrowings .
calls by some to lower taxes were " illusory " , he added .
ahead of germany 's federal election in september , several opposition parties slammed the latest projections .
liberal free democrat party spokesman jürgen koppelin said germany was financially worse off than at the beginning of merkel 's coalition in 2005 - despite efforts in recent years to consolidate budgets . koppelin demanded a cash audit straight after the election and rigorous re-examination of all expenditures .
the greens ' budgetary expert alexander bonde said the projected 86 billion euro gap in projected new borrowings was a " fatal " development .
by 2013 , he added , total government debt would be much higher .
ministry projections to be presented to merkel 's cabinet next week show new state borrowings for 2011 of 71 billion euros and 59 billion euros in 2012 .
total federal public expenditure next year is set to rise by eight percent to 328 billion euros but then decline somewhat by 2013 to 313 billion euros .
next year 's biggest spender will be the federal ministry of labour and social affairs , representing half of the overall budget .
its spending includes funding for germany 's 3.5 million unemployed and 1.2 million workers on so-called kurzarbeit , subsidised shortened working hours .
the european commission , which monitors the deficits of european union countries , has forecast that many member nations will breach budgetary limits in 2009 and 2010 .
under the eu 's stability and growth pact , eurozone governments are not supposed to run up deficits beyond three percent of each country 's gross domestic product or gdp .
last wednesday , steinbrueck said german public debt this year would probably reach 4.4 percent of gdp. ipj / reuters / afp / ap editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany ’ s pop music industry has canceled its most important annual trade fair .
popkomm organizers blame a decline in potential exhibitors on the recession and on-line piracy . popkomm , germany 's annual trade fair that normally showcases the pop music industry and youth entertainment trends in berlin and abroad has been canceled for this year .
dieter gorny , who initiated popkomm , originally in cologne , said unpaid music downloads by internet users had left companies struggling . gorny blamed politicians , saying the exhibition 's cancellation was the result of their inaction on piracy .
they had failed to grasp its serious impact , said gorny , who heads of the german bvmi music industry association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music manager dieter gorny " the digital crisis has hit the music industry head on .
losing revenues to illegal downloads on the internet , many companies can simply no longer afford to participate at popkomm . "
if legislative action was not taken soon all efforts by the music industry would fail to bear fruit , said gorny .
the bvmi says that for every legally purchased download in germany , eight others are pirated .
visitor numbers down popkomm organizers decided to cancel the fair , saying an anticipated 50 percent drop in visitor numbers for this year would have made it impossible to keep the event on a sound professional footing . although popkomm 2008 attracted 842 exhibitors from 52 countries , plus 14,000 industry participants , overall visitor numbers had already dropped by 20 percent ..
popkomm chief ralf kleinhenz said there had been a lot of positive feedback after the event was shifted from cologne to berlin back in 2004 .
but this year there were simply not enough exhibitor and visitor registrations to guarantee a successful event for 2009 .
it had been scheduled to take place in mid-september .
aside from the exhibition , the organizers have also called off the pop music festival that usually adds zest to business transactions at the trade fair .
popkomm organizers say they are working on a new concept for the next trade fair in 2010 .

germany ’ s pop music industry has canceled its most important annual trade fair .
popkomm organizers blame a decline in potential exhibitors on the recession and on-line piracy . popkomm , germany 's annual trade fair that normally showcases the pop music industry and youth entertainment trends in berlin and abroad has been canceled for this year .
dieter gorny , who initiated popkomm , originally in cologne , said unpaid music downloads by internet users had left companies struggling . gorny blamed politicians , saying the exhibition 's cancellation was the result of their inaction on piracy .
they had failed to grasp its serious impact , said gorny , who heads of the german bvmi music industry association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music manager dieter gorny " the digital crisis has hit the music industry head on .
losing revenues to illegal downloads on the internet , many companies can simply no longer afford to participate at popkomm . "
if legislative action was not taken soon all efforts by the music industry would fail to bear fruit , said gorny .
the bvmi says that for every legally purchased download in germany , eight others are pirated .
visitor numbers down popkomm organizers decided to cancel the fair , saying an anticipated 50 percent drop in visitor numbers for this year would have made it impossible to keep the event on a sound professional footing . although popkomm 2008 attracted 842 exhibitors from 52 countries , plus 14,000 industry participants , overall visitor numbers had already dropped by 20 percent ..
popkomm chief ralf kleinhenz said there had been a lot of positive feedback after the event was shifted from cologne to berlin back in 2004 .
but this year there were simply not enough exhibitor and visitor registrations to guarantee a successful event for 2009 .
it had been scheduled to take place in mid-september .
aside from the exhibition , the organizers have also called off the pop music festival that usually adds zest to business transactions at the trade fair .
popkomm organizers say they are working on a new concept for the next trade fair in 2010 .
there will be a sharper focus on networking between participants , as well as a conference and more attractive public events. ipj / dpa / ap editor : greg benzow send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 'm very concerned based on some of the tenor and tone of the statements that have been made that the government of iran recognizes that the world is watching , " obama told cbs news .
" and how they approach and deal with people who are , through peaceful means , trying to be heard will , i think , send a pretty clear signal to the international community about what iran is and - and is not . "
asked whether he had a message to the demonstrators , obama replied " i absolutely do . "
" we stand behind those who are seeking justice in a peaceful way , ” obama said .
" we stand with those who would look to peaceful resolution of conflict and we believe that the voices of people have to be heard . "
obama rejects tehran 's claims of intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran says the us has stirred up the protesters the president also attempted to debunk claims by some in the iranian leadership that the opposition demonstrators were acting at the behest of the united states , which has had a long history of antagonism with iran .
tehran , with which washington severed ties shortly after iran 's 1979 islamic revolution , has already accused the united states of " interventionist " statements on the election .
" let 's understand that this notion that somehow these hundreds of thousands of people , who are pouring into the streets in iran , are somehow responding to the west or the united states .
that 's an old distraction that i think has been trotted out periodically .
and that 's just not going to fly . "
obama also said washington must be careful not to become " a foil for those forces inside iran who would love nothing better than to make this an argument about the united states .
that 's what they do .
that 's what we 're already seeing .
we should n't be playing into that . "
obama has been less critical of the election than many european leaders to avoid being accused of meddling in the election and potentially triggering a backlash against the demonstrators just as his administration seeks to engage tehran over its nuclear program .
us officials keen to keep out of developing crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us does n't want to give iran any more ammunition senior us officials earlier stressed that washington was making strenuous efforts to avoid being drawn into the crisis in a way that could be used by the government against the demonstrators .
" the more the united states looks like they are going to interfere , the more it is going to be detrimental , " said one official on condition of anonymity .
" this is not about us . "
despite assurances by top officials that washington would not inject itself into the crisis , both houses of the us congress voted to condemn violence against demonstrators by the government of iran the house resolution , which passed by 405 votes to one , expressed " its support for all iranian citizens who embrace the values of freedom , human rights , civil liberties , and rule of law . "
it also " condemns the ongoing violence against demonstrators by the government of iran and pro-government militias , as well as the ongoing government suppression of independent electronic communication through interference with the internet and cell phones . "
democrat howard berman , chairman of the house foreign affairs committee , said the bill was not a " judgment on who won the iranian elections . "
" it is an acknowledgement that we can not remain silent when cherished , universal principles are under attack . "
critics want harder tone from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john mccain is among those who want a harder tone on friday , senator john mccain told reuters the iranian election was " corrupt " and urged obama to speak out more forcefully on behalf of the demonstrators .
" i 'm not saying send arms to them , i 'm not saying they should foment revolution , i 'm not saying they should do anything but hear that the united states of america supports their assertion of their basic human rights , " said mccain , who lost to obama in last year 's us presidential election .
iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said on friday that last week 's election was won fairly by president mahmoud ahmadinejad and not rigged , as defeated candidate mirhossein mousavi alleges .

" i 'm very concerned based on some of the tenor and tone of the statements that have been made that the government of iran recognizes that the world is watching , " obama told cbs news .

us defense officials confirmed that the ship was being monitored and said that the north korean ship was one of a group of vessels previously linked to illicit missile-related cargo .
defense sources have yet to indicate if , or when , they might ask to search the vessel under the un security council resolution , which bans shipments of arms and nuclear or missile technology to and from north korea .
the north koreans are expected to reject any such request .
but at some point , the ship will likely need to stop for refueling along the chinese coast or elsewhere , officials said .
at that point , the country where the ship enters port is obliged under the un resolution to search the vessel if there are grounds for suspicion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us navy ships are patrolling for resolution-busting vessels pentagon officials declined to comment on a television report that the navy destroyer was heading to intercept the north korean vessel .
the officials stressed that the un sanctions do not authorize military force and that washington was pursuing a diplomatic strategy .
tensions on the korean peninsula have been running high since pyongyang carried out its second nuclear test last month .
after the underground test and subsequent missile launches , the un security council adopted a resolution last week that includes financial sanctions designed to choke off revenue to the regime .
hawaii on alert in other developments , the us military has moved to beef up missile defenses in hawaii over fears pyongyang may launch a rocket over the pacific .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us missile batteries are on alert on the island of hawaii us defense secretary robert gates , citing concerns that north korea might launch a missile towards hawaii , said thursday he had approved the deployment of thaad missile defense weaponry to the pacific island chain as a precaution .
however , us military officials say they have no indication that north korean missile technology has improved markedly since past failed launches , and military and other assessments suggest the communist nation probably could not hit the westernmost us state if it tried .
the north 's taepodong-2 could travel that far in theory , if it works as designed .
but three test launches have either failed or do not demonstrate anything close to that range .
nonetheless , past failure should not be considered a predictor , one military official said , and the seaborne radar and land-based interceptors were added this week as a prudent backstop .
us , china set for talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong il has been ratcheting up the pressure meanwhile , the us urged china on friday to support international pressure on north korea in talks next week .
the pentagon officials will also ask china to agree to more contacts between the countries ' armed forces in hopes of building a more open dialogue and reducing tensions .
the us-china talks will be the latest in a flurry of international discussions which most recently included the meeting of european leaders to discuss north korea , the un resolution and increasing eu sanctions on friday .
eu agrees on fresh sanctions in a statement , the council of eu heads of state and government " insists on the importance of a swift and efficient implementation of all these measures " adopted by the un security council last week .
the fresh sanctions include a ban on shipments of arms and nuclear and missile technology to and from north korea .
the eu summit statement , issued after two days of talks between european leaders , condemned the recent nuclear and ballistic missile tests in the isolated communist state .
the leaders called on the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , to " transpose this resolution in a robust way and without delay in order to reinforce coercive measures aimed at the north korean leaders and entities linked to them . "
the statement also called on pyongyang to " engage in dialogue and cooperation " , including the resumption of international talks on its nuclear program. nda / afp / reuters / ap editor : greg benzow send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us defense officials confirmed that the ship was being monitored and said that the north korean ship was one of a group of vessels previously linked to illicit missile-related cargo .
defense sources have yet to indicate if , or when , they might ask to search the vessel under the un security council resolution , which bans shipments of arms and nuclear or missile technology to and from north korea .
the north koreans are expected to reject any such request .
but at some point , the ship will likely need to stop for refueling along the chinese coast or elsewhere , officials said .
at that point , the country where the ship enters port is obliged under the un resolution to search the vessel if there are grounds for suspicion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us navy ships are patrolling for resolution-busting vessels pentagon officials declined to comment on a television report that the navy destroyer was heading to intercept the north korean vessel .
the officials stressed that the un sanctions do not authorize military force and that washington was pursuing a diplomatic strategy .
tensions on the korean peninsula have been running high since pyongyang carried out its second nuclear test last month .
after the underground test and subsequent missile launches , the un security council adopted a resolution last week that includes financial sanctions designed to choke off revenue to the regime .
hawaii on alert in other developments , the us military has moved to beef up missile defenses in hawaii over fears pyongyang may launch a rocket over the pacific .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us missile batteries are on alert on the island of hawaii us defense secretary robert gates , citing concerns that north korea might launch a missile towards hawaii , said thursday he had approved the deployment of thaad missile defense weaponry to the pacific island chain as a precaution .
however , us military officials say they have no indication that north korean missile technology has improved markedly since past failed launches , and military and other assessments suggest the communist nation probably could not hit the westernmost us state if it tried .
the north 's taepodong-2 could travel that far in theory , if it works as designed .
but three test launches have either failed or do not demonstrate anything close to that range .
nonetheless , past failure should not be considered a predictor , one military official said , and the seaborne radar and land-based interceptors were added this week as a prudent backstop .
us , china set for talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong il has been ratcheting up the pressure meanwhile , the us urged china on friday to support international pressure on north korea in talks next week .
the pentagon officials will also ask china to agree to more contacts between the countries ' armed forces in hopes of building a more open dialogue and reducing tensions .
the us-china talks will be the latest in a flurry of international discussions which most recently included the meeting of european leaders to discuss north korea , the un resolution and increasing eu sanctions on friday .
eu agrees on fresh sanctions in a statement , the council of eu heads of state and government " insists on the importance of a swift and efficient implementation of all these measures " adopted by the un security council last week .
the fresh sanctions include a ban on shipments of arms and nuclear and missile technology to and from north korea .
the eu summit statement , issued after two days of talks between european leaders , condemned the recent nuclear and ballistic missile tests in the isolated communist state .
the leaders called on the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , to " transpose this resolution in a robust way and without delay in order to reinforce coercive measures aimed at the north korean leaders and entities linked to them . "
the statement also called on pyongyang to " engage in dialogue and cooperation " , including the resumption of international talks on its nuclear program. nda / afp / reuters / ap editor : greg benzow send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

congress also assuaged the fears of foreign carmakers that the program would only apply to american-made cars .
the bill passed by congress contains no such restrictions , and means a toyota made in tokyo could be traded for a chrysler made in detroit , and vice-versa , a congressional staffer confirmed .
stefan jacoby , volkswagen of america 's president and chief executive , called the vote “ historic ” and in a statement urged us shoppers to put volkswagen 's “ fun-to-drive , fuel-efficient vehicles ” on their “ shopping list . ”

qualifying autos in the us will be in good driving condition , less than 25 years old , have been continuously insured in accordance with state laws and have a fuel efficiency of 18 miles per gallon -lrb- 7.65 km per liter -rrb- or less .
a qualifying car or truck will potentially be brought to a new car dealership for up to $ 4500 -lrb- 3200 euros -rrb- in a tax free voucher which will be applied toward the sale or lease price of the new vehicle , which must have a fuel efficiency of at least 22 mpg .

luxury and higher end vehicles in europe have seen little or no results from the cash-for-clunkers program , whereas more economic brands such as hyundai have seen growth .
registrations of new cars in europe fell 4.9 percent to 1.27 million vehicles in may .
in the us , the auto industry market remains in steep decline , with sales for 2008 down 17.5 percent to 13.2 million vehicles and figures expected at less than 10 million for 2009 .
the us cars exchange program is expected to inject an additional 250,000 new cars sales , a number which should please the automakers in detroit. sjt / reuters / afp / dpa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's a fair ambition , " says mr phillips , " but he is a man with vision .
he 's also a man who understands that however much money you throw at something , it does n't necessarily happen . "
