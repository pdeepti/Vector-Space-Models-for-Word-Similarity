a new german study of organic and ethical fashion shows the growing industry is n't all it 's cracked up to be - especially when it comes to verifying adherence to " green " standards . recent years have seen a boom in the the organic , socially conscious textile industry .
small ethical t-shirt companies are shooting up left and right , and even big producers like hennes & mauritz have jumped on the bandwagon , making a line of organic cotton clothes .
in light of this , the german non-profit organization suedwind tested these companies to see if they delivered what they advertised - and to what extent .
questionnaires were sent out to 240 companies whose ecologically or socially conscious products can be ordered online in germany .
just 23 companies - 17 of them german - responded .
verification is an issue suedwind said the aim of the study was to see how closely the companies complied with generally accepted industry standards for ethical production , such as widespread international labor organization conventions and fair-trade labelling rules , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fairtrade is one of several groups out to verify compliance " many companies call themselves green , or ethical or fair , " said dominic kloos , who ran the suedwind study .
" but are they really ethical or ecological ?
that 's what we wanted to find out . "
kloos acknowledged that the low rate of response meant the study shows " tendencies " rather than giving a full picture of the industry .
but overall , despite progress , he said the results showed that " many … complied with some of the most important standards , but not with all of them . "
seven ' green ' criteria the suedwind study examined seven criteria , from checking ecological standards -lrb- are all components certified organic ? -rrb- and social ones -lrb- does the company comply with the " clean clothes campaign " code of conduct throughout its entire production chain ? -rrb- .
it also looked at verification measures , transparency levels , raw materials sourcing , and the chemical content of the clothes , among others .
" the main outcome is that ecological standards are easier to verify than social ones , " kloos said .
while environmental standards can be verified by certification agencies , social standards can only be upheld if a company is a member of a so-called multi-stakeholder initiative , or if they are a cooperative , " which means the work standards are in the workers ' hands , " kloos said .
overall , the study showed that 69 percent of the companies said they fulfilled basic social conventions , while 22 percent in accordance with listed ecological standards .
of those , 35 percent had external verification procedures for ecological standards - but only four of the 23 companies said they externally verified social standards .
raising the bar kloos acknowledged that his job is to " raise the bar very high " when shining a light on company behaviors .
but the fact that eco-clothing companies exist at all is a good sign for the future of the textile industry : " it 's great that these niche companies exist - they put pressure on the market , so that bigger companies , like h & m , come out with organic clothing , " he said .
ultimately , though , we do n't need to improve social and ecological standards on a voluntary basis , kloos said .
" what we need is legally binding rules . "

a new german study of organic and ethical fashion shows the growing industry is n't all it 's cracked up to be - especially when it comes to verifying adherence to " green " standards . recent years have seen a boom in the the organic , socially conscious textile industry .
small ethical t-shirt companies are shooting up left and right , and even big producers like hennes & mauritz have jumped on the bandwagon , making a line of organic cotton clothes .
in light of this , the german non-profit organization suedwind tested these companies to see if they delivered what they advertised - and to what extent .
questionnaires were sent out to 240 companies whose ecologically or socially conscious products can be ordered online in germany .
just 23 companies - 17 of them german - responded .
verification is an issue suedwind said the aim of the study was to see how closely the companies complied with generally accepted industry standards for ethical production , such as widespread international labor organization conventions and fair-trade labelling rules , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fairtrade is one of several groups out to verify compliance " many companies call themselves green , or ethical or fair , " said dominic kloos , who ran the suedwind study .
" but are they really ethical or ecological ?
that 's what we wanted to find out . "
kloos acknowledged that the low rate of response meant the study shows " tendencies " rather than giving a full picture of the industry .
but overall , despite progress , he said the results showed that " many … complied with some of the most important standards , but not with all of them . "
seven ' green ' criteria the suedwind study examined seven criteria , from checking ecological standards -lrb- are all components certified organic ? -rrb- and social ones -lrb- does the company comply with the " clean clothes campaign " code of conduct throughout its entire production chain ? -rrb- .
it also looked at verification measures , transparency levels , raw materials sourcing , and the chemical content of the clothes , among others .
" the main outcome is that ecological standards are easier to verify than social ones , " kloos said .
while environmental standards can be verified by certification agencies , social standards can only be upheld if a company is a member of a so-called multi-stakeholder initiative , or if they are a cooperative , " which means the work standards are in the workers ' hands , " kloos said .
overall , the study showed that 69 percent of the companies said they fulfilled basic social conventions , while 22 percent in accordance with listed ecological standards .
of those , 35 percent had external verification procedures for ecological standards - but only four of the 23 companies said they externally verified social standards .
raising the bar kloos acknowledged that his job is to " raise the bar very high " when shining a light on company behaviors .
but the fact that eco-clothing companies exist at all is a good sign for the future of the textile industry : " it 's great that these niche companies exist - they put pressure on the market , so that bigger companies , like h & m , come out with organic clothing , " he said .
ultimately , though , we do n't need to improve social and ecological standards on a voluntary basis , kloos said .
" what we need is legally binding rules . "

a new german study of organic and ethical fashion shows the growing industry is n't all it 's cracked up to be - especially when it comes to verifying adherence to " green " standards . recent years have seen a boom in the the organic , socially conscious textile industry .
small ethical t-shirt companies are shooting up left and right , and even big producers like hennes & mauritz have jumped on the bandwagon , making a line of organic cotton clothes .
in light of this , the german non-profit organization suedwind tested these companies to see if they delivered what they advertised - and to what extent .
questionnaires were sent out to 240 companies whose ecologically or socially conscious products can be ordered online in germany .
just 23 companies - 17 of them german - responded .
verification is an issue suedwind said the aim of the study was to see how closely the companies complied with generally accepted industry standards for ethical production , such as widespread international labor organization conventions and fair-trade labelling rules , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fairtrade is one of several groups out to verify compliance " many companies call themselves green , or ethical or fair , " said dominic kloos , who ran the suedwind study .
" but are they really ethical or ecological ?
that 's what we wanted to find out . "
kloos acknowledged that the low rate of response meant the study shows " tendencies " rather than giving a full picture of the industry .
but overall , despite progress , he said the results showed that " many … complied with some of the most important standards , but not with all of them . "
seven ' green ' criteria the suedwind study examined seven criteria , from checking ecological standards -lrb- are all components certified organic ? -rrb- and social ones -lrb- does the company comply with the " clean clothes campaign " code of conduct throughout its entire production chain ? -rrb- .
it also looked at verification measures , transparency levels , raw materials sourcing , and the chemical content of the clothes , among others .
" the main outcome is that ecological standards are easier to verify than social ones , " kloos said .
while environmental standards can be verified by certification agencies , social standards can only be upheld if a company is a member of a so-called multi-stakeholder initiative , or if they are a cooperative , " which means the work standards are in the workers ' hands , " kloos said .
overall , the study showed that 69 percent of the companies said they fulfilled basic social conventions , while 22 percent in accordance with listed ecological standards .
of those , 35 percent had external verification procedures for ecological standards - but only four of the 23 companies said they externally verified social standards .
raising the bar kloos acknowledged that his job is to " raise the bar very high " when shining a light on company behaviors .
but the fact that eco-clothing companies exist at all is a good sign for the future of the textile industry : " it 's great that these niche companies exist - they put pressure on the market , so that bigger companies , like h & m , come out with organic clothing , " he said .
ultimately , though , we do n't need to improve social and ecological standards on a voluntary basis , kloos said .
" what we need is legally binding rules . "

the islands were particularly badly hit by the tsunami in 2004 and some 6,000 people lost their lives .
some inhabitants want to promote tourism to the islands but environmentalists fear this could have disastrous consequences for the tribes who still live there isolated from the rest of the world . crystal clear water reflecting the thousand colours of the sun .
a white sandy beach .
palm trees blowing in the wind .
radhanagar beach on havelock island is surely one of the most beautiful beaches in the world and the best thing is that there are hardly any tourists .
those who have found the place are enchanted .
25-year-old carsten schiller from hamburg thinks that " the andamans are the most beautiful place in india for relaxing and enjoying the sun . "
" the most important thing here is the diving , " says a finnish tourist .
" the islands are a bit out of the way and therefore there aren ’ t so many tourists .
everything is still and calm here . "
islands need to be promoted for tourism the former head of the andaman and nicobar chamber of trade and commerce , mohammad jadwed , thinks that the potential for tourism has to be exploited .
he owns a fleet of ships that he uses to transport tourists to the islands .
" i think that the tsunami is one of the most terrible historical events to ever hit the islands , ” he says .
" and yet the catastrophe also had a positive effect .
before , the andaman and nicobar islands were not to be found on any map of the world .
even many indians didn ’ t know where they were .
but since the tsunami people have been aware of us .
we have to make the most of this fact . "
tourism to the islands grew steadily until 2004 .
some 150,000 tourists would come from the indian mainland and abroad .
there were plans to build big luxury hotels .
but then the tsunami struck .
now the taj hotel chain is planning to build a massive resort .
and the government is reviewing a hundred million euro investment plan that includes the islands .
the number of flights from the indian mainland has already doubled .
there is also talk of opening the provincial capital port blair ’ s airport to international flights .
potential disaster for indigenous tribes environmentalist samir acharya thinks this would be disastrous for the tribes who live on the islands .
" of course we need tourism on these islands , " he says .
" but to misuse tourism is wrong .
and all this talk of eco-tourism is just fashionable .
today there is a lot of greenwashing . "
samir acharya is not only worried about the region ’ s biodiversity .
he also wants to know who the tourist boom is supposed to help .
the indian settlers or the indigenous population ?
he thinks that the jarawas , who live on a reserve , are particularly at threat .
shyami sodhi , who is in charge of the well-being of the tribes on the islands of andaman and nicobar , worries that the jarawas could lose their traditions .
" they live next to a big road .
their lifestyle and their culture are coming into contact with our lifestyle and our culture more and more .
we ’ re getting closer to another .
we have to be careful . "
six years ago , india ’ s supreme court ruled that the road should be closed down but this has not happened .
there are rumours that some tourists pay a lot of money to visit the jarawas .
they exchange photos for a biscuit or some other item of food that the jarawas do not know .
at the moment , these are only isolated incidents but observers worry that this paradise on earth could well disappear over the next few years .

1 2009 , beijing ’ s tiananmen square was transformed into a stage to celebrate the founding of the people ’ s republic of china 60 years ago .
there was a large military parade to demonstrate china 's military might .
despite the country 's economic strengths , it still has far to go in terms of human rights . president hu jintao opened the 60th anniversary ceremony to firing canons , wearing a suit like mao zedong 's .
a two-hour parade , which included tanks and missiles , 8,000 soldiers , 60 floats and 100,000 well trained civilians symbolised the country ’ s growing military and economic might .
but there was much criticism of china on the occasion .
in hong kong , for example , there were massive demonstrations against the lack of progress on human rights and democracy .
earlier on in 2009 , on the 50th anniversary of the failed tibetan uprising in march , people all over the world demonstrated for tibet ’ s autonomy .
after 50 years in exile , the dalai lama has not given up the fight .
“ the problem with the people ’ s republic of china is that they consider me a trouble maker , ” he said this year .
“ so it is my duty to create more trouble . ”
trouble in xinjiang there was also “ trouble ” in china 's north-western region of xinjiang , where the uighurs and majority han chinese clashed in july , causing some 200 deaths .
the mainly muslim uighurs complain - like many other minorities in china - of cultural and religious repression .
2009 also marked the 20th anniversary of the massacre on tiananmen square , which can arguably be considered the most potent symbol of chinese repression in the country ’ s recent past .
the chinese media were banned from discussing it .
the british human rights risk atlas ranked china 12th “ most risky country ” overall for human rights this year .
for child labour , forced labour , and violations of freedom of association , discrimination and working conditions , china ranked highest .
“ no transparency in china ” liu xiaobo is one of china 's most prominent dissidents and is currently awaiting sentencing on charges of subversion .
" i have lost faith , ” his wife liu xia said in august .
“ there is absolutely no transparency here .
if you live in a country in which freedom of speech isn ’ t worth a dime , anyone can be convicted . ”
“ i am very worried , ” she continued .
“ they have accused him of felonies , for which he could receive up to 15 years in prison .
he didn ’ t do anything , aside from telling the truth and stating his opinion .
here in china they call that ‘ breaking the law ’ . ”
liu xiaobo 's sentence is expected to be handed down on christmas day .
optimism about economic situation although china was criticised for its human rights record , its economic situation in 2009 gave rise to hope .
despite world recession , china ’ s economy continued to grow at a rate of eight to 10 percent .
the optimism expressed by many economists at the beginning of the year seems to have been vindicated .
“ the statistics are showing recovery in many sectors of the economy , ” the head of the chinese central bank , zhal xiaochuan , said in january .
“ this means that our economic stimulus programme is taking hold .
the chinese state council has made it clear that our reaction to the crisis must be quick and resolute . ”
the positive signs in china 's economy have been attributed to an increase in chinese consumerism and lending and investments abroad .
with this strategy , experts say china is leading the world out of the financial crisis and will continue to do so in 2010 .

1 2009 , beijing ’ s tiananmen square was transformed into a stage to celebrate the founding of the people ’ s republic of china 60 years ago .
there was a large military parade to demonstrate china 's military might .
despite the country 's economic strengths , it still has far to go in terms of human rights . president hu jintao opened the 60th anniversary ceremony to firing canons , wearing a suit like mao zedong 's .
a two-hour parade , which included tanks and missiles , 8,000 soldiers , 60 floats and 100,000 well trained civilians symbolised the country ’ s growing military and economic might .
but there was much criticism of china on the occasion .
in hong kong , for example , there were massive demonstrations against the lack of progress on human rights and democracy .
earlier on in 2009 , on the 50th anniversary of the failed tibetan uprising in march , people all over the world demonstrated for tibet ’ s autonomy .
after 50 years in exile , the dalai lama has not given up the fight .

the mainly muslim uighurs complain - like many other minorities in china - of cultural and religious repression .
2009 also marked the 20th anniversary of the massacre on tiananmen square , which can arguably be considered the most potent symbol of chinese repression in the country ’ s recent past .
the chinese media were banned from discussing it .
the british human rights risk atlas ranked china 12th “ most risky country ” overall for human rights this year .
for child labour , forced labour , and violations of freedom of association , discrimination and working conditions , china ranked highest .

the islands were particularly badly hit by the tsunami in 2004 and some 6,000 people lost their lives .
some inhabitants want to promote tourism to the islands but environmentalists fear this could have disastrous consequences for the tribes who still live there isolated from the rest of the world . crystal clear water reflecting the thousand colours of the sun .
a white sandy beach .
palm trees blowing in the wind .
radhanagar beach on havelock island is surely one of the most beautiful beaches in the world and the best thing is that there are hardly any tourists .
those who have found the place are enchanted .
25-year-old carsten schiller from hamburg thinks that " the andamans are the most beautiful place in india for relaxing and enjoying the sun . "
" the most important thing here is the diving , " says a finnish tourist .
" the islands are a bit out of the way and therefore there aren ’ t so many tourists .
everything is still and calm here . "
islands need to be promoted for tourism the former head of the andaman and nicobar chamber of trade and commerce , mohammad jadwed , thinks that the potential for tourism has to be exploited .
he owns a fleet of ships that he uses to transport tourists to the islands .
" i think that the tsunami is one of the most terrible historical events to ever hit the islands , ” he says .
" and yet the catastrophe also had a positive effect .
before , the andaman and nicobar islands were not to be found on any map of the world .
even many indians didn ’ t know where they were .
but since the tsunami people have been aware of us .
we have to make the most of this fact . "
tourism to the islands grew steadily until 2004 .
some 150,000 tourists would come from the indian mainland and abroad .
there were plans to build big luxury hotels .
but then the tsunami struck .
now the taj hotel chain is planning to build a massive resort .
and the government is reviewing a hundred million euro investment plan that includes the islands .
the number of flights from the indian mainland has already doubled .
there is also talk of opening the provincial capital port blair ’ s airport to international flights .
potential disaster for indigenous tribes environmentalist samir acharya thinks this would be disastrous for the tribes who live on the islands .
" of course we need tourism on these islands , " he says .
" but to misuse tourism is wrong .
and all this talk of eco-tourism is just fashionable .
today there is a lot of greenwashing . "
samir acharya is not only worried about the region ’ s biodiversity .
he also wants to know who the tourist boom is supposed to help .
the indian settlers or the indigenous population ?
he thinks that the jarawas , who live on a reserve , are particularly at threat .
shyami sodhi , who is in charge of the well-being of the tribes on the islands of andaman and nicobar , worries that the jarawas could lose their traditions .
" they live next to a big road .
their lifestyle and their culture are coming into contact with our lifestyle and our culture more and more .
we ’ re getting closer to another .
we have to be careful . "
six years ago , india ’ s supreme court ruled that the road should be closed down but this has not happened .
there are rumours that some tourists pay a lot of money to visit the jarawas .
they exchange photos for a biscuit or some other item of food that the jarawas do not know .
at the moment , these are only isolated incidents but observers worry that this paradise on earth could well disappear over the next few years .

1 2009 , beijing ’ s tiananmen square was transformed into a stage to celebrate the founding of the people ’ s republic of china 60 years ago .
there was a large military parade to demonstrate china 's military might .
despite the country 's economic strengths , it still has far to go in terms of human rights . president hu jintao opened the 60th anniversary ceremony to firing canons , wearing a suit like mao zedong 's .
a two-hour parade , which included tanks and missiles , 8,000 soldiers , 60 floats and 100,000 well trained civilians symbolised the country ’ s growing military and economic might .
but there was much criticism of china on the occasion .
in hong kong , for example , there were massive demonstrations against the lack of progress on human rights and democracy .
earlier on in 2009 , on the 50th anniversary of the failed tibetan uprising in march , people all over the world demonstrated for tibet ’ s autonomy .
after 50 years in exile , the dalai lama has not given up the fight .
“ the problem with the people ’ s republic of china is that they consider me a trouble maker , ” he said this year .
“ so it is my duty to create more trouble . ”
trouble in xinjiang there was also “ trouble ” in china 's north-western region of xinjiang , where the uighurs and majority han chinese clashed in july , causing some 200 deaths .
the mainly muslim uighurs complain - like many other minorities in china - of cultural and religious repression .
2009 also marked the 20th anniversary of the massacre on tiananmen square , which can arguably be considered the most potent symbol of chinese repression in the country ’ s recent past .
the chinese media were banned from discussing it .
the british human rights risk atlas ranked china 12th “ most risky country ” overall for human rights this year .
for child labour , forced labour , and violations of freedom of association , discrimination and working conditions , china ranked highest .
“ no transparency in china ” liu xiaobo is one of china 's most prominent dissidents and is currently awaiting sentencing on charges of subversion .
" i have lost faith , ” his wife liu xia said in august .
“ there is absolutely no transparency here .
if you live in a country in which freedom of speech isn ’ t worth a dime , anyone can be convicted . ”
“ i am very worried , ” she continued .
“ they have accused him of felonies , for which he could receive up to 15 years in prison .
he didn ’ t do anything , aside from telling the truth and stating his opinion .
here in china they call that ‘ breaking the law ’ . ”
liu xiaobo 's sentence is expected to be handed down on christmas day .
optimism about economic situation although china was criticised for its human rights record , its economic situation in 2009 gave rise to hope .
despite world recession , china ’ s economy continued to grow at a rate of eight to 10 percent .
the optimism expressed by many economists at the beginning of the year seems to have been vindicated .
“ the statistics are showing recovery in many sectors of the economy , ” the head of the chinese central bank , zhal xiaochuan , said in january .
“ this means that our economic stimulus programme is taking hold .
the chinese state council has made it clear that our reaction to the crisis must be quick and resolute . ”
the positive signs in china 's economy have been attributed to an increase in chinese consumerism and lending and investments abroad .
with this strategy , experts say china is leading the world out of the financial crisis and will continue to do so in 2010 .

1 2009 , beijing ’ s tiananmen square was transformed into a stage to celebrate the founding of the people ’ s republic of china 60 years ago .
there was a large military parade to demonstrate china 's military might .
despite the country 's economic strengths , it still has far to go in terms of human rights . president hu jintao opened the 60th anniversary ceremony to firing canons , wearing a suit like mao zedong 's .
a two-hour parade , which included tanks and missiles , 8,000 soldiers , 60 floats and 100,000 well trained civilians symbolised the country ’ s growing military and economic might .
but there was much criticism of china on the occasion .
in hong kong , for example , there were massive demonstrations against the lack of progress on human rights and democracy .
earlier on in 2009 , on the 50th anniversary of the failed tibetan uprising in march , people all over the world demonstrated for tibet ’ s autonomy .
after 50 years in exile , the dalai lama has not given up the fight .
“ the problem with the people ’ s republic of china is that they consider me a trouble maker , ” he said this year .
“ so it is my duty to create more trouble . ”
trouble in xinjiang there was also “ trouble ” in china 's north-western region of xinjiang , where the uighurs and majority han chinese clashed in july , causing some 200 deaths .
the mainly muslim uighurs complain - like many other minorities in china - of cultural and religious repression .
2009 also marked the 20th anniversary of the massacre on tiananmen square , which can arguably be considered the most potent symbol of chinese repression in the country ’ s recent past .
the chinese media were banned from discussing it .
the british human rights risk atlas ranked china 12th “ most risky country ” overall for human rights this year .
for child labour , forced labour , and violations of freedom of association , discrimination and working conditions , china ranked highest .
“ no transparency in china ” liu xiaobo is one of china 's most prominent dissidents and is currently awaiting sentencing on charges of subversion .
" i have lost faith , ” his wife liu xia said in august .
“ there is absolutely no transparency here .
if you live in a country in which freedom of speech isn ’ t worth a dime , anyone can be convicted . ”
“ i am very worried , ” she continued .
“ they have accused him of felonies , for which he could receive up to 15 years in prison .
he didn ’ t do anything , aside from telling the truth and stating his opinion .
here in china they call that ‘ breaking the law ’ . ”
liu xiaobo 's sentence is expected to be handed down on christmas day .
optimism about economic situation although china was criticised for its human rights record , its economic situation in 2009 gave rise to hope .
despite world recession , china ’ s economy continued to grow at a rate of eight to 10 percent .
the optimism expressed by many economists at the beginning of the year seems to have been vindicated .
“ the statistics are showing recovery in many sectors of the economy , ” the head of the chinese central bank , zhal xiaochuan , said in january .
“ this means that our economic stimulus programme is taking hold .
the chinese state council has made it clear that our reaction to the crisis must be quick and resolute . ”
the positive signs in china 's economy have been attributed to an increase in chinese consumerism and lending and investments abroad .
with this strategy , experts say china is leading the world out of the financial crisis and will continue to do so in 2010 .

1 2009 , beijing ’ s tiananmen square was transformed into a stage to celebrate the founding of the people ’ s republic of china 60 years ago .
there was a large military parade to demonstrate china 's military might .
despite the country 's economic strengths , it still has far to go in terms of human rights . president hu jintao opened the 60th anniversary ceremony to firing canons , wearing a suit like mao zedong 's .
a two-hour parade , which included tanks and missiles , 8,000 soldiers , 60 floats and 100,000 well trained civilians symbolised the country ’ s growing military and economic might .
but there was much criticism of china on the occasion .
in hong kong , for example , there were massive demonstrations against the lack of progress on human rights and democracy .
earlier on in 2009 , on the 50th anniversary of the failed tibetan uprising in march , people all over the world demonstrated for tibet ’ s autonomy .
after 50 years in exile , the dalai lama has not given up the fight .
“ the problem with the people ’ s republic of china is that they consider me a trouble maker , ” he said this year .
“ so it is my duty to create more trouble . ”
trouble in xinjiang there was also “ trouble ” in china 's north-western region of xinjiang , where the uighurs and majority han chinese clashed in july , causing some 200 deaths .
the mainly muslim uighurs complain - like many other minorities in china - of cultural and religious repression .
2009 also marked the 20th anniversary of the massacre on tiananmen square , which can arguably be considered the most potent symbol of chinese repression in the country ’ s recent past .
the chinese media were banned from discussing it .
the british human rights risk atlas ranked china 12th “ most risky country ” overall for human rights this year .
for child labour , forced labour , and violations of freedom of association , discrimination and working conditions , china ranked highest .
“ no transparency in china ” liu xiaobo is one of china 's most prominent dissidents and is currently awaiting sentencing on charges of subversion .
" i have lost faith , ” his wife liu xia said in august .
“ there is absolutely no transparency here .
if you live in a country in which freedom of speech isn ’ t worth a dime , anyone can be convicted . ”
“ i am very worried , ” she continued .
“ they have accused him of felonies , for which he could receive up to 15 years in prison .
he didn ’ t do anything , aside from telling the truth and stating his opinion .
here in china they call that ‘ breaking the law ’ . ”
liu xiaobo 's sentence is expected to be handed down on christmas day .
optimism about economic situation although china was criticised for its human rights record , its economic situation in 2009 gave rise to hope .
despite world recession , china ’ s economy continued to grow at a rate of eight to 10 percent .
the optimism expressed by many economists at the beginning of the year seems to have been vindicated .
“ the statistics are showing recovery in many sectors of the economy , ” the head of the chinese central bank , zhal xiaochuan , said in january .
“ this means that our economic stimulus programme is taking hold .
the chinese state council has made it clear that our reaction to the crisis must be quick and resolute . ”
the positive signs in china 's economy have been attributed to an increase in chinese consumerism and lending and investments abroad .
with this strategy , experts say china is leading the world out of the financial crisis and will continue to do so in 2010 .

a two-hour parade , which included tanks and missiles , 8,000 soldiers , 60 floats and 100,000 well trained civilians symbolised the country ’ s growing military and economic might .

1 2009 , beijing ’ s tiananmen square was transformed into a stage to celebrate the founding of the people ’ s republic of china 60 years ago .
there was a large military parade to demonstrate china 's military might .
despite the country 's economic strengths , it still has far to go in terms of human rights . president hu jintao opened the 60th anniversary ceremony to firing canons , wearing a suit like mao zedong 's .
a two-hour parade , which included tanks and missiles , 8,000 soldiers , 60 floats and 100,000 well trained civilians symbolised the country ’ s growing military and economic might .
but there was much criticism of china on the occasion .
in hong kong , for example , there were massive demonstrations against the lack of progress on human rights and democracy .
earlier on in 2009 , on the 50th anniversary of the failed tibetan uprising in march , people all over the world demonstrated for tibet ’ s autonomy .
after 50 years in exile , the dalai lama has not given up the fight .
“ the problem with the people ’ s republic of china is that they consider me a trouble maker , ” he said this year .
“ so it is my duty to create more trouble . ”
trouble in xinjiang there was also “ trouble ” in china 's north-western region of xinjiang , where the uighurs and majority han chinese clashed in july , causing some 200 deaths .
the mainly muslim uighurs complain - like many other minorities in china - of cultural and religious repression .
2009 also marked the 20th anniversary of the massacre on tiananmen square , which can arguably be considered the most potent symbol of chinese repression in the country ’ s recent past .
the chinese media were banned from discussing it .
the british human rights risk atlas ranked china 12th “ most risky country ” overall for human rights this year .
for child labour , forced labour , and violations of freedom of association , discrimination and working conditions , china ranked highest .
“ no transparency in china ” liu xiaobo is one of china 's most prominent dissidents and is currently awaiting sentencing on charges of subversion .
" i have lost faith , ” his wife liu xia said in august .
“ there is absolutely no transparency here .

“ i am very worried , ” she continued .
“ they have accused him of felonies , for which he could receive up to 15 years in prison .
he didn ’ t do anything , aside from telling the truth and stating his opinion .
here in china they call that ‘ breaking the law ’ . ”
liu xiaobo 's sentence is expected to be handed down on christmas day .
optimism about economic situation although china was criticised for its human rights record , its economic situation in 2009 gave rise to hope .
despite world recession , china ’ s economy continued to grow at a rate of eight to 10 percent .
the optimism expressed by many economists at the beginning of the year seems to have been vindicated .
“ the statistics are showing recovery in many sectors of the economy , ” the head of the chinese central bank , zhal xiaochuan , said in january .

the islands were particularly badly hit by the tsunami in 2004 and some 6,000 people lost their lives .
some inhabitants want to promote tourism to the islands but environmentalists fear this could have disastrous consequences for the tribes who still live there isolated from the rest of the world . crystal clear water reflecting the thousand colours of the sun .
a white sandy beach .
palm trees blowing in the wind .
radhanagar beach on havelock island is surely one of the most beautiful beaches in the world and the best thing is that there are hardly any tourists .
those who have found the place are enchanted .
25-year-old carsten schiller from hamburg thinks that " the andamans are the most beautiful place in india for relaxing and enjoying the sun . "
" the most important thing here is the diving , " says a finnish tourist .
" the islands are a bit out of the way and therefore there aren ’ t so many tourists .
everything is still and calm here . "
islands need to be promoted for tourism the former head of the andaman and nicobar chamber of trade and commerce , mohammad jadwed , thinks that the potential for tourism has to be exploited .
he owns a fleet of ships that he uses to transport tourists to the islands .
" i think that the tsunami is one of the most terrible historical events to ever hit the islands , ” he says .
" and yet the catastrophe also had a positive effect .
before , the andaman and nicobar islands were not to be found on any map of the world .
even many indians didn ’ t know where they were .
but since the tsunami people have been aware of us .
we have to make the most of this fact . "
tourism to the islands grew steadily until 2004 .
some 150,000 tourists would come from the indian mainland and abroad .
there were plans to build big luxury hotels .
but then the tsunami struck .
now the taj hotel chain is planning to build a massive resort .
and the government is reviewing a hundred million euro investment plan that includes the islands .
the number of flights from the indian mainland has already doubled .
there is also talk of opening the provincial capital port blair ’ s airport to international flights .
potential disaster for indigenous tribes environmentalist samir acharya thinks this would be disastrous for the tribes who live on the islands .
" of course we need tourism on these islands , " he says .
" but to misuse tourism is wrong .
and all this talk of eco-tourism is just fashionable .
today there is a lot of greenwashing . "
samir acharya is not only worried about the region ’ s biodiversity .
he also wants to know who the tourist boom is supposed to help .
the indian settlers or the indigenous population ?
he thinks that the jarawas , who live on a reserve , are particularly at threat .
shyami sodhi , who is in charge of the well-being of the tribes on the islands of andaman and nicobar , worries that the jarawas could lose their traditions .
" they live next to a big road .
their lifestyle and their culture are coming into contact with our lifestyle and our culture more and more .
we ’ re getting closer to another .
we have to be careful . "
six years ago , india ’ s supreme court ruled that the road should be closed down but this has not happened .
there are rumours that some tourists pay a lot of money to visit the jarawas .
they exchange photos for a biscuit or some other item of food that the jarawas do not know .
at the moment , these are only isolated incidents but observers worry that this paradise on earth could well disappear over the next few years .

1 2009 , beijing ’ s tiananmen square was transformed into a stage to celebrate the founding of the people ’ s republic of china 60 years ago .
there was a large military parade to demonstrate china 's military might .
despite the country 's economic strengths , it still has far to go in terms of human rights . president hu jintao opened the 60th anniversary ceremony to firing canons , wearing a suit like mao zedong 's .
a two-hour parade , which included tanks and missiles , 8,000 soldiers , 60 floats and 100,000 well trained civilians symbolised the country ’ s growing military and economic might .
but there was much criticism of china on the occasion .
in hong kong , for example , there were massive demonstrations against the lack of progress on human rights and democracy .
earlier on in 2009 , on the 50th anniversary of the failed tibetan uprising in march , people all over the world demonstrated for tibet ’ s autonomy .
after 50 years in exile , the dalai lama has not given up the fight .
“ the problem with the people ’ s republic of china is that they consider me a trouble maker , ” he said this year .
“ so it is my duty to create more trouble . ”
trouble in xinjiang there was also “ trouble ” in china 's north-western region of xinjiang , where the uighurs and majority han chinese clashed in july , causing some 200 deaths .
the mainly muslim uighurs complain - like many other minorities in china - of cultural and religious repression .
2009 also marked the 20th anniversary of the massacre on tiananmen square , which can arguably be considered the most potent symbol of chinese repression in the country ’ s recent past .
the chinese media were banned from discussing it .
the british human rights risk atlas ranked china 12th “ most risky country ” overall for human rights this year .
for child labour , forced labour , and violations of freedom of association , discrimination and working conditions , china ranked highest .
“ no transparency in china ” liu xiaobo is one of china 's most prominent dissidents and is currently awaiting sentencing on charges of subversion .
" i have lost faith , ” his wife liu xia said in august .
“ there is absolutely no transparency here .
if you live in a country in which freedom of speech isn ’ t worth a dime , anyone can be convicted . ”
“ i am very worried , ” she continued .
“ they have accused him of felonies , for which he could receive up to 15 years in prison .
he didn ’ t do anything , aside from telling the truth and stating his opinion .
here in china they call that ‘ breaking the law ’ . ”
liu xiaobo 's sentence is expected to be handed down on christmas day .
optimism about economic situation although china was criticised for its human rights record , its economic situation in 2009 gave rise to hope .
despite world recession , china ’ s economy continued to grow at a rate of eight to 10 percent .
the optimism expressed by many economists at the beginning of the year seems to have been vindicated .
“ the statistics are showing recovery in many sectors of the economy , ” the head of the chinese central bank , zhal xiaochuan , said in january .
“ this means that our economic stimulus programme is taking hold .
the chinese state council has made it clear that our reaction to the crisis must be quick and resolute . ”
the positive signs in china 's economy have been attributed to an increase in chinese consumerism and lending and investments abroad .
with this strategy , experts say china is leading the world out of the financial crisis and will continue to do so in 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 24.12.2009 ' dear christkind ' : a german post office answers christmas letters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of letters arrive every christmas in engelskirchen in the small town of engelskirchen , thousands of letters from around the world arrive at a seasonal christmas post office , all addressed to one person .
for over 20 years , postal workers have written back . it 's a tradition for young children around the world to send letters to santa claus with their wishes for christmas .
german children , however , practice a slightly different tradition .
they often send letters to the christkind , who is responsible for bringing the presents on christmas .
the christkind is a symbolic representation of the christmas spirit that is often depicted as a christmas angel .
many of those letters land in a small town in western germany called engelskirchen .
translated , the town 's name means " angels ' church " - a fitting name for the seasonal home of a christmas post office .
the post office , located on the town 's aptly named " angels ' square , " is one of six official addresses in germany for letters addressed to the christkind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans picture the christkind as a kind of fairy , or angel the tradition started in 1985 , when other post offices around germany were n't sure what to do with letters addressed to the christkind .
" since engelskirchen was such a nice name , they ended up just sending them there , " said britta toellner , a spokeswoman for germany 's mail carrier deutsche post .
" and at the time , there was a manager here who opened the letters and saw that they were christmas lists , so just for fun , she answered a few . "
the christkind 's new home before long , a few turned into many , as mountains of letters started arriving in engelskirchen .
the postal workers started taking letters home with them to write responses to children hoping to hear from the christkind .
but at some point , it got to be too much to handle as a side project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letters come in from all over the world " we were getting so many letters from all corners of the earth that we decided to get organized , " toeller said .
" during the holidays , we rent an office and have up to 12 helpers who answer the thousands of letters that come every day . "
last year , 145,000 letters were sent to the christmas post office in engelskirchen , and the number is expected to grow this year .
most of the letters are classic christmas wish lists , with requests ranging from toys to companionship in the form of pets or siblings .
wish lists answers to the letters are written very diplomatically , explaining for instance that not every wish can be granted .
but the postal workers try and include a small gift to tide the children over until christmas , such as small paper cut-outs .
while many children ask the christkind to bring them presents , the christmas post office often receives personal and endearing messages from children .
" for example , kids will ask ' can you say hello to my mother ?
she 's in heaven and lives with you there . '
those letters are tough to take , " said toeller .
" increasingly , they are also thinking of the bigger picture .
we used to see lots of messages for peace on earth and goodwill toward people , which they often simply picked up somewhere , but now kids are noticing that something is not quite right with the environment .
and they speak their minds about it . "
the letters come from all over the world , some from countries as far away as australia , japan , or togo .
no matter where they come from , children write to the christkind in the spirit of christmas .
and in that same spirit , the workers at germany 's christmas post office in engelskirchen write back .

sparkling stars on the tree , a fair-haired and angelic baby , brightly-wrapped presents and joyful carols sung by church choirs are all parts of the celebrations on dec .
24 , the day marking the birth of jesus christ . between 1933 and 1945 , under the third reich , christmas was just as popular as it is today .
but honoring the birth of a jewish baby - who was celebrated as the christian savior - was difficult for nazis to embrace .
as a result , national socialist ideologues decided to remove christian symbolism from the celebration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis aimed to take the jewish baby , jesus , out of christmas " celebrating the birth of a jewish baby was unthinkable for the nazis , " said juergen mueller , the chief researcher behind the exhibit " not such a holy night " at the national socialism documentation center in cologne , which documents christmas tradition during the third reich . but christmas was too popular even during the nazi period to be banned , mueller told deutsche welle . " they therefore decided to corrupt it . " initially nazi officials had tried to reject all christian traditions .
they renamed the festival julfest and propagated the germanic origins of the winter celebration of light on december 21 , the winter solstice . but for the majority of germans , the christian traditions were still the basis of the holiday . mueller said nazi officials then took inspiration from classical images showing a baby jesus with his loving parents , mary and joseph .
they reinterpreted this as a model aryan family , an image which the nazis had elevated to the highest levels during the late 1930s .
so for the nazis , the family rather than jesus became the center of the christmas celebrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the nazis , grenade- shaped ornaments replaced stars churches in germany , although outraged by the nazis ' fervent efforts to undermine beliefs central to christianity , were powerless to protest what was happening . " the reaction of the church was not very strong .
at about 1936-1937 , the nazi government was so powerful that the possibility of protest was extremely low , " mueller said .
" the church could n't really condemn it or protest against it , although it stuck to the christian traditions within itself , " he added . nazi christmas tree decorations no aspect of the christmas celebrations was free of nazi symbolism .
the tree , which has long been a central component of german christmas festivities , was stripped of its traditional decorations .
stars , angels , bells , fruit and candy were replaced with swastikas and ornaments shaped like miniature cannons , grenades and fighter planes .
at the top of the tree , instead of a star or angel , firm adherents to the nazi doctrine placed a soaring golden eagle , the german national symbol .
parents wrapped their children 's presents in brightly colored paper with nazi symbols . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandizing christmas in germany dates back to wwi the most difficult of images for the nazis to undermine was the star .
a six-pointed christmas star was too similar to the yellow star the jews were required to wear ; and a five-pointed star resembled the red star of the soviets .
as a result , the nazis banned stars completely from christmas tree decorations .
geometric shapes embossed with swastikas or germanic symbols were used instead . popular christmas carols were also rendered christianity-free by nazi composers .
barbara kirschbaum , one of the staff members at the ns documentation center , told deutsche welle : " the nazis tried to ban some of the christmas carols with open christian content . " " some of the songs got new lyrics , some were completely recreated , " she said . " hohe nacht der klaren sterne " -lrb- " high night of bright stars " -rrb- is one of the songs newly created by the nazis .
one transformed song , " es ist fuer uns eine zeit angekommen " -lrb- " the time has come for us " -rrb- , is still popular in the nazi version .
people sing it even in churches , not being aware of the history of the lyrics , " kirschbaum said . public reaction for kirschbaum , the purpose of the exhibition is to discover what can be learned from the way the nazis manipulated christmas imagery .
she said people need to understand that history is shaped by people , and that propaganda is used to rewrite history .
when the visitors see this in the exhibit , it will increase their awareness of what happened under the nazis , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas wreath redone in nazi style " older visitors at first are usually touched by their childhood memories , which are reawakened by the objects .
but slowly they see the purpose behind the things , something they often did n't realize when they were young .
and this frightens them , to see how things were used and how their beliefs as children were used for propaganda purposes , " said kirschbaum . angelika wasserburger , a 51-year-old visitor to the exhibition from nuremberg , found the reality very uncomfortable . " i think it 's very frightening to realize how many of our traditions , how many of our symbols , have this origin which we do n't realize anymore .
and it 's very frightening also to realize the misuse that has been implemented with those symbols and traditions , " she told deutsche welle . the reaction of younger visitors to the exhibition is even stronger . jonas rahimi , a 15-year-old who came to the exhibition on a school trip , was shocked by how deeply nazism left its imprint on christmas celebrations in germany . " the nazis really involved their radical views in every part of life .
there was even a little war game for kids .
it 's very shocking to me , " he said .

images of the holy family , stars and religious songs were manipulated to take the " christ " out of christmas . christmas is a high point in the religious calendar for germans .
many of the traditions , images and songs enjoyed around the world have their roots in the christmas celebrations of german speaking countries .
sparkling stars on the tree , a fair-haired and angelic baby , brightly-wrapped presents and joyful carols sung by church choirs are all parts of the celebrations on dec .
24 , the day marking the birth of jesus christ . between 1933 and 1945 , under the third reich , christmas was just as popular as it is today .
but honoring the birth of a jewish baby - who was celebrated as the christian savior - was difficult for nazis to embrace .
as a result , national socialist ideologues decided to remove christian symbolism from the celebration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis aimed to take the jewish baby , jesus , out of christmas " celebrating the birth of a jewish baby was unthinkable for the nazis , " said juergen mueller , the chief researcher behind the exhibit " not such a holy night " at the national socialism documentation center in cologne , which documents christmas tradition during the third reich . but christmas was too popular even during the nazi period to be banned , mueller told deutsche welle . " they therefore decided to corrupt it . " initially nazi officials had tried to reject all christian traditions .
they renamed the festival julfest and propagated the germanic origins of the winter celebration of light on december 21 , the winter solstice . but for the majority of germans , the christian traditions were still the basis of the holiday . mueller said nazi officials then took inspiration from classical images showing a baby jesus with his loving parents , mary and joseph .
they reinterpreted this as a model aryan family , an image which the nazis had elevated to the highest levels during the late 1930s .
so for the nazis , the family rather than jesus became the center of the christmas celebrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the nazis , grenade- shaped ornaments replaced stars churches in germany , although outraged by the nazis ' fervent efforts to undermine beliefs central to christianity , were powerless to protest what was happening . " the reaction of the church was not very strong .
at about 1936-1937 , the nazi government was so powerful that the possibility of protest was extremely low , " mueller said .
" the church could n't really condemn it or protest against it , although it stuck to the christian traditions within itself , " he added . nazi christmas tree decorations no aspect of the christmas celebrations was free of nazi symbolism .
the tree , which has long been a central component of german christmas festivities , was stripped of its traditional decorations .
stars , angels , bells , fruit and candy were replaced with swastikas and ornaments shaped like miniature cannons , grenades and fighter planes .
at the top of the tree , instead of a star or angel , firm adherents to the nazi doctrine placed a soaring golden eagle , the german national symbol .
parents wrapped their children 's presents in brightly colored paper with nazi symbols . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandizing christmas in germany dates back to wwi the most difficult of images for the nazis to undermine was the star .
a six-pointed christmas star was too similar to the yellow star the jews were required to wear ; and a five-pointed star resembled the red star of the soviets .
as a result , the nazis banned stars completely from christmas tree decorations .
geometric shapes embossed with swastikas or germanic symbols were used instead . popular christmas carols were also rendered christianity-free by nazi composers .
barbara kirschbaum , one of the staff members at the ns documentation center , told deutsche welle : " the nazis tried to ban some of the christmas carols with open christian content . " " some of the songs got new lyrics , some were completely recreated , " she said . " hohe nacht der klaren sterne " -lrb- " high night of bright stars " -rrb- is one of the songs newly created by the nazis .
one transformed song , " es ist fuer uns eine zeit angekommen " -lrb- " the time has come for us " -rrb- , is still popular in the nazi version .
people sing it even in churches , not being aware of the history of the lyrics , " kirschbaum said . public reaction for kirschbaum , the purpose of the exhibition is to discover what can be learned from the way the nazis manipulated christmas imagery .
she said people need to understand that history is shaped by people , and that propaganda is used to rewrite history .
when the visitors see this in the exhibit , it will increase their awareness of what happened under the nazis , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas wreath redone in nazi style " older visitors at first are usually touched by their childhood memories , which are reawakened by the objects .
but slowly they see the purpose behind the things , something they often did n't realize when they were young .

images of the holy family , stars and religious songs were manipulated to take the " christ " out of christmas . christmas is a high point in the religious calendar for germans .
many of the traditions , images and songs enjoyed around the world have their roots in the christmas celebrations of german speaking countries .
sparkling stars on the tree , a fair-haired and angelic baby , brightly-wrapped presents and joyful carols sung by church choirs are all parts of the celebrations on dec .
24 , the day marking the birth of jesus christ . between 1933 and 1945 , under the third reich , christmas was just as popular as it is today .
but honoring the birth of a jewish baby - who was celebrated as the christian savior - was difficult for nazis to embrace .
as a result , national socialist ideologues decided to remove christian symbolism from the celebration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis aimed to take the jewish baby , jesus , out of christmas " celebrating the birth of a jewish baby was unthinkable for the nazis , " said juergen mueller , the chief researcher behind the exhibit " not such a holy night " at the national socialism documentation center in cologne , which documents christmas tradition during the third reich . but christmas was too popular even during the nazi period to be banned , mueller told deutsche welle . " they therefore decided to corrupt it . " initially nazi officials had tried to reject all christian traditions .
they renamed the festival julfest and propagated the germanic origins of the winter celebration of light on december 21 , the winter solstice . but for the majority of germans , the christian traditions were still the basis of the holiday . mueller said nazi officials then took inspiration from classical images showing a baby jesus with his loving parents , mary and joseph .
they reinterpreted this as a model aryan family , an image which the nazis had elevated to the highest levels during the late 1930s .
so for the nazis , the family rather than jesus became the center of the christmas celebrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the nazis , grenade- shaped ornaments replaced stars churches in germany , although outraged by the nazis ' fervent efforts to undermine beliefs central to christianity , were powerless to protest what was happening . " the reaction of the church was not very strong .
at about 1936-1937 , the nazi government was so powerful that the possibility of protest was extremely low , " mueller said .
" the church could n't really condemn it or protest against it , although it stuck to the christian traditions within itself , " he added . nazi christmas tree decorations no aspect of the christmas celebrations was free of nazi symbolism .
the tree , which has long been a central component of german christmas festivities , was stripped of its traditional decorations .
stars , angels , bells , fruit and candy were replaced with swastikas and ornaments shaped like miniature cannons , grenades and fighter planes .
at the top of the tree , instead of a star or angel , firm adherents to the nazi doctrine placed a soaring golden eagle , the german national symbol .
parents wrapped their children 's presents in brightly colored paper with nazi symbols . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandizing christmas in germany dates back to wwi the most difficult of images for the nazis to undermine was the star .
a six-pointed christmas star was too similar to the yellow star the jews were required to wear ; and a five-pointed star resembled the red star of the soviets .
as a result , the nazis banned stars completely from christmas tree decorations .
geometric shapes embossed with swastikas or germanic symbols were used instead . popular christmas carols were also rendered christianity-free by nazi composers .
barbara kirschbaum , one of the staff members at the ns documentation center , told deutsche welle : " the nazis tried to ban some of the christmas carols with open christian content . " " some of the songs got new lyrics , some were completely recreated , " she said . " hohe nacht der klaren sterne " -lrb- " high night of bright stars " -rrb- is one of the songs newly created by the nazis .
one transformed song , " es ist fuer uns eine zeit angekommen " -lrb- " the time has come for us " -rrb- , is still popular in the nazi version .
people sing it even in churches , not being aware of the history of the lyrics , " kirschbaum said . public reaction for kirschbaum , the purpose of the exhibition is to discover what can be learned from the way the nazis manipulated christmas imagery .
she said people need to understand that history is shaped by people , and that propaganda is used to rewrite history .
when the visitors see this in the exhibit , it will increase their awareness of what happened under the nazis , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas wreath redone in nazi style " older visitors at first are usually touched by their childhood memories , which are reawakened by the objects .
but slowly they see the purpose behind the things , something they often did n't realize when they were young .
and this frightens them , to see how things were used and how their beliefs as children were used for propaganda purposes , " said kirschbaum . angelika wasserburger , a 51-year-old visitor to the exhibition from nuremberg , found the reality very uncomfortable . " i think it 's very frightening to realize how many of our traditions , how many of our symbols , have this origin which we do n't realize anymore .
and it 's very frightening also to realize the misuse that has been implemented with those symbols and traditions , " she told deutsche welle . the reaction of younger visitors to the exhibition is even stronger . jonas rahimi , a 15-year-old who came to the exhibition on a school trip , was shocked by how deeply nazism left its imprint on christmas celebrations in germany . " the nazis really involved their radical views in every part of life .
there was even a little war game for kids .
it 's very shocking to me , " he said .

a six-pointed christmas star was too similar to the yellow star the jews were required to wear ; and a five-pointed star resembled the red star of the soviets .
as a result , the nazis banned stars completely from christmas tree decorations .
geometric shapes embossed with swastikas or germanic symbols were used instead . popular christmas carols were also rendered christianity-free by nazi composers .
barbara kirschbaum , one of the staff members at the ns documentation center , told deutsche welle : " the nazis tried to ban some of the christmas carols with open christian content . " " some of the songs got new lyrics , some were completely recreated , " she said . " hohe nacht der klaren sterne " -lrb- " high night of bright stars " -rrb- is one of the songs newly created by the nazis .

people sing it even in churches , not being aware of the history of the lyrics , " kirschbaum said . public reaction for kirschbaum , the purpose of the exhibition is to discover what can be learned from the way the nazis manipulated christmas imagery .
she said people need to understand that history is shaped by people , and that propaganda is used to rewrite history .

images of the holy family , stars and religious songs were manipulated to take the " christ " out of christmas . christmas is a high point in the religious calendar for germans .
many of the traditions , images and songs enjoyed around the world have their roots in the christmas celebrations of german speaking countries .
sparkling stars on the tree , a fair-haired and angelic baby , brightly-wrapped presents and joyful carols sung by church choirs are all parts of the celebrations on dec .
24 , the day marking the birth of jesus christ . between 1933 and 1945 , under the third reich , christmas was just as popular as it is today .
but honoring the birth of a jewish baby - who was celebrated as the christian savior - was difficult for nazis to embrace .
as a result , national socialist ideologues decided to remove christian symbolism from the celebration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis aimed to take the jewish baby , jesus , out of christmas " celebrating the birth of a jewish baby was unthinkable for the nazis , " said juergen mueller , the chief researcher behind the exhibit " not such a holy night " at the national socialism documentation center in cologne , which documents christmas tradition during the third reich . but christmas was too popular even during the nazi period to be banned , mueller told deutsche welle . " they therefore decided to corrupt it . " initially nazi officials had tried to reject all christian traditions .
they renamed the festival julfest and propagated the germanic origins of the winter celebration of light on december 21 , the winter solstice . but for the majority of germans , the christian traditions were still the basis of the holiday . mueller said nazi officials then took inspiration from classical images showing a baby jesus with his loving parents , mary and joseph .
they reinterpreted this as a model aryan family , an image which the nazis had elevated to the highest levels during the late 1930s .
so for the nazis , the family rather than jesus became the center of the christmas celebrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the nazis , grenade- shaped ornaments replaced stars churches in germany , although outraged by the nazis ' fervent efforts to undermine beliefs central to christianity , were powerless to protest what was happening . " the reaction of the church was not very strong .
at about 1936-1937 , the nazi government was so powerful that the possibility of protest was extremely low , " mueller said .
" the church could n't really condemn it or protest against it , although it stuck to the christian traditions within itself , " he added . nazi christmas tree decorations no aspect of the christmas celebrations was free of nazi symbolism .
the tree , which has long been a central component of german christmas festivities , was stripped of its traditional decorations .
stars , angels , bells , fruit and candy were replaced with swastikas and ornaments shaped like miniature cannons , grenades and fighter planes .
at the top of the tree , instead of a star or angel , firm adherents to the nazi doctrine placed a soaring golden eagle , the german national symbol .
parents wrapped their children 's presents in brightly colored paper with nazi symbols . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandizing christmas in germany dates back to wwi the most difficult of images for the nazis to undermine was the star .
a six-pointed christmas star was too similar to the yellow star the jews were required to wear ; and a five-pointed star resembled the red star of the soviets .

germany 's rail operator deutsche bahn announced on wednesday that only one out of two regularly scheduled trains would be running on the high speed ice route connecting berlin , leipzig and munich until after christmas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramsauer says delays are ' more than annoying ' the reason : excessive snow and ice have taken too many trains out of action .
trains ' not built for these temperatures ' " the trains are not built to withstand these siberian temperatures , " deutsche bahn spokesman joerg boehnisch said , referring to temperatures dropping to minus 20 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
according to boehnisch , the technical failures on the ice trains are similar to those that brought eurostar trains , which run between london , brussels and paris , to a standstill this past weekend .
" a series of trains have broken down because , as with the eurostar trains , dry powder snow is drawn through the ventilation grill into the train and can affect the electrical components , " he explained .
transport minister acknowledges problem travelers whose trains are delayed up to an hour will receive a 25 percent reduction of their fare while those who must wait two hours will be given 50 percent of their ticket price back .
passengers who are unable to complete their journey because their train has been cancelled will be reimbursed completely .
german transport minister peter ramsauer told daily sueddeutsche zeitung that for many passengers the timetable issues were " more than annoying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 24.12.2009 mercedes deal with schumacher draws criticism as fans celebrate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have questioned the business sense of schumacher 's signing mercedes ' decision to hire the services of michael schumacher to spearhead its formula one campaign has drawn criticism .
the logic of the move has been questioned , but the fans are just happy to see their hero back . the appointment of michael schumacher is making waves – with some claiming that carmaker mercedes has got its business priorities wrong .
german racing fans , on the other hand , appear to be delighted and schumacher will be happy to know that – after three years in retirement – he even has the full support of his wife .
mercedes secured the services of the 40-year-old german on wednesday , in a one-year deal .
the seven time drivers ' champion is to earn around seven million euros -lrb- $ 10 million -rrb- .
the move drew criticism from the mercedes labor representatives in light of recession cost-cutting measures by brand owner daimler .
" it 's hard to put across to people , " the chairman of mercedes ' bremen works council , uwe werner , told the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions have expressed criticism about the timing of the move " the daimler board decrees , on the one hand , harsh austerity measures for the workforce , and has shifted some production to facilities in other countries .
on the other hand it spends tens of millions on formula one .
it is incomprehensible to many workers . "
werner added that the company 's cost cutting measures would have received more support if mercedes had pulled out of formula one altogether .
deal " will sell cars " the head of mercedes motor sports , norbert haug , disagrees .
he said that the company would make money as a result of formula one and , in particular , signing the star driver .
" the whole issue will sell many cars and the caliber of the star will make a lot of people sit up and pay attention , " said haug .
the investment will not pay off for the company according to ferdinand dudenhoeffer , an economics professor at the university of duisburg-essen who specializes in the car industry .
he questions whether customers will buy a mercedes based on the fact that the brand had a formula one presence .
" you can hardly comprehend it . they will have to charge about 200 to 300 euros more for every car sold , to finance the formula one campaign for mercedes .
mercedes is a company for which sportiness is not the main selling point , it is instead based on safety and on quality on the road . "
rush on race tickets despite this , many german fans are euphoric at the news – with a rush on tickets for the race at hockenheim next july .
formula one supremo bernie ecclestone hailed the news as " fantastic " and predicted a " jaw-dropping season . "
" i think it is fantastic for formula one that he turned into a comeback kid but at the same time i also think it 's good for michael , " said ecclestone .
" when drivers have put in many years they sometimes lose focus and motivation – probably that was one of the reasons for his retirement in 2006 – but now he has again put all his strength together and has a 100 percent motivation level and that will give us many exciting races in 2010 .
forget about winning races – i have him on my bill for winning the championship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher was formula one world champion seven times and schumacher himself said he was confident of his abilities .
" obviously our only goal can be to fight for the world championship , " he told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
he said he has " no doubt " about his skills behind the wheel .
" i never stopped my physical training , " he said .
support from home schumacher can count on the full support of his wife of 14 years corinna .
" he knows exactly what he is doing and he knows that i am always behind him , " she said .
" he needs his challenges ; that 's just michael .
i understand it and i think it 's really great . "
she acknowledged that family life would be turned upside down , but said that when her husband told her of the call he had from his former and new team boss ross brawn " i immediately sensed that there was this fire burning inside him that i know so well . " schumacher had already tried to re-enter the sport this year , standing in for injured brazilian felipe massa for his former employer , ferrari .
but a motorcycle neck injury , from which schumacher says he has recovered , cut short any comeback attempt. rc / sid / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

georgian-russian relations have been strained since a short war fought last year . ties between russia and georgia appeared to be improving on thursday after a swiss-brokered deal resulted in a plan to reopen a mountain pass on the border .
all border crossings and flights between the two nations have been closed since the august war fought in 2008 .
" according to our preliminary verbal agreement with the russian side , the verkhny lars checkpoint will open in early march , " georgian deputy foreign minister nino kalandadze told a news conference .
georgia and russia fought a brief war last year over the georgian breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
opening up the border would be the first sign of thaw in diplomatic ties between russia and georgia which were severed after the war .
the russian border service also released a statement citing the " shared need to resume international traffic between georgia and russia . "
all is not forgiven moscow has repeatedly asserted , however , that it would not resume official relations with georgia as long as president mikheil saakashvili remains in power .
kalandadze said the agreement would allow georgian citizens and cargo to cross the border and that a formal protocol on reopening the crossing would be finalized within two weeks .
on tuesday , georgian airlines airzena asked the russian government to allow it to run charter flights between tbilisi and moscow during the winter holiday period .
approximately one million georgians live in russia .
" we assess the resumption of air links positively .
we hope that negotiations between private air companies on resumption of flights will result in a positive decision , " kalandadze said. sjt / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

georgian-russian relations have been strained since a short war fought last year . ties between russia and georgia appeared to be improving on thursday after a swiss-brokered deal resulted in a plan to reopen a mountain pass on the border .
all border crossings and flights between the two nations have been closed since the august war fought in 2008 .
" according to our preliminary verbal agreement with the russian side , the verkhny lars checkpoint will open in early march , " georgian deputy foreign minister nino kalandadze told a news conference .
georgia and russia fought a brief war last year over the georgian breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
opening up the border would be the first sign of thaw in diplomatic ties between russia and georgia which were severed after the war .
the russian border service also released a statement citing the " shared need to resume international traffic between georgia and russia . "
all is not forgiven moscow has repeatedly asserted , however , that it would not resume official relations with georgia as long as president mikheil saakashvili remains in power .
kalandadze said the agreement would allow georgian citizens and cargo to cross the border and that a formal protocol on reopening the crossing would be finalized within two weeks .
on tuesday , georgian airlines airzena asked the russian government to allow it to run charter flights between tbilisi and moscow during the winter holiday period .
approximately one million georgians live in russia .
" we assess the resumption of air links positively .
we hope that negotiations between private air companies on resumption of flights will result in a positive decision , " kalandadze said. sjt / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the logic of the move has been questioned , but the fans are just happy to see their hero back . the appointment of michael schumacher is making waves – with some claiming that carmaker mercedes has got its business priorities wrong .
german racing fans , on the other hand , appear to be delighted and schumacher will be happy to know that – after three years in retirement – he even has the full support of his wife .
mercedes secured the services of the 40-year-old german on wednesday , in a one-year deal .
the seven time drivers ' champion is to earn around seven million euros -lrb- $ 10 million -rrb- .
the move drew criticism from the mercedes labor representatives in light of recession cost-cutting measures by brand owner daimler .
" it 's hard to put across to people , " the chairman of mercedes ' bremen works council , uwe werner , told the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions have expressed criticism about the timing of the move " the daimler board decrees , on the one hand , harsh austerity measures for the workforce , and has shifted some production to facilities in other countries .
on the other hand it spends tens of millions on formula one .
it is incomprehensible to many workers . "
werner added that the company 's cost cutting measures would have received more support if mercedes had pulled out of formula one altogether .
deal " will sell cars " the head of mercedes motor sports , norbert haug , disagrees .
he said that the company would make money as a result of formula one and , in particular , signing the star driver .
" the whole issue will sell many cars and the caliber of the star will make a lot of people sit up and pay attention , " said haug .
the investment will not pay off for the company according to ferdinand dudenhoeffer , an economics professor at the university of duisburg-essen who specializes in the car industry .
he questions whether customers will buy a mercedes based on the fact that the brand had a formula one presence .
" you can hardly comprehend it . they will have to charge about 200 to 300 euros more for every car sold , to finance the formula one campaign for mercedes .
mercedes is a company for which sportiness is not the main selling point , it is instead based on safety and on quality on the road . "
rush on race tickets despite this , many german fans are euphoric at the news – with a rush on tickets for the race at hockenheim next july .
formula one supremo bernie ecclestone hailed the news as " fantastic " and predicted a " jaw-dropping season . "
" i think it is fantastic for formula one that he turned into a comeback kid but at the same time i also think it 's good for michael , " said ecclestone .
" when drivers have put in many years they sometimes lose focus and motivation – probably that was one of the reasons for his retirement in 2006 – but now he has again put all his strength together and has a 100 percent motivation level and that will give us many exciting races in 2010 .
forget about winning races – i have him on my bill for winning the championship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher was formula one world champion seven times and schumacher himself said he was confident of his abilities .
" obviously our only goal can be to fight for the world championship , " he told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
he said he has " no doubt " about his skills behind the wheel .
" i never stopped my physical training , " he said .
support from home schumacher can count on the full support of his wife of 14 years corinna .
" he knows exactly what he is doing and he knows that i am always behind him , " she said .
" he needs his challenges ; that 's just michael .
i understand it and i think it 's really great . "
she acknowledged that family life would be turned upside down , but said that when her husband told her of the call he had from his former and new team boss ross brawn " i immediately sensed that there was this fire burning inside him that i know so well . " schumacher had already tried to re-enter the sport this year , standing in for injured brazilian felipe massa for his former employer , ferrari .

georgian-russian relations have been strained since a short war fought last year . ties between russia and georgia appeared to be improving on thursday after a swiss-brokered deal resulted in a plan to reopen a mountain pass on the border .
all border crossings and flights between the two nations have been closed since the august war fought in 2008 .
" according to our preliminary verbal agreement with the russian side , the verkhny lars checkpoint will open in early march , " georgian deputy foreign minister nino kalandadze told a news conference .
georgia and russia fought a brief war last year over the georgian breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
opening up the border would be the first sign of thaw in diplomatic ties between russia and georgia which were severed after the war .
the russian border service also released a statement citing the " shared need to resume international traffic between georgia and russia . "
all is not forgiven moscow has repeatedly asserted , however , that it would not resume official relations with georgia as long as president mikheil saakashvili remains in power .
kalandadze said the agreement would allow georgian citizens and cargo to cross the border and that a formal protocol on reopening the crossing would be finalized within two weeks .
on tuesday , georgian airlines airzena asked the russian government to allow it to run charter flights between tbilisi and moscow during the winter holiday period .
approximately one million georgians live in russia .
" we assess the resumption of air links positively .
we hope that negotiations between private air companies on resumption of flights will result in a positive decision , " kalandadze said. sjt / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the logic of the move has been questioned , but the fans are just happy to see their hero back . the appointment of michael schumacher is making waves – with some claiming that carmaker mercedes has got its business priorities wrong .
german racing fans , on the other hand , appear to be delighted and schumacher will be happy to know that – after three years in retirement – he even has the full support of his wife .
mercedes secured the services of the 40-year-old german on wednesday , in a one-year deal .
the seven time drivers ' champion is to earn around seven million euros -lrb- $ 10 million -rrb- .
the move drew criticism from the mercedes labor representatives in light of recession cost-cutting measures by brand owner daimler .
" it 's hard to put across to people , " the chairman of mercedes ' bremen works council , uwe werner , told the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions have expressed criticism about the timing of the move " the daimler board decrees , on the one hand , harsh austerity measures for the workforce , and has shifted some production to facilities in other countries .
on the other hand it spends tens of millions on formula one .
it is incomprehensible to many workers . "
werner added that the company 's cost cutting measures would have received more support if mercedes had pulled out of formula one altogether .
deal " will sell cars " the head of mercedes motor sports , norbert haug , disagrees .
he said that the company would make money as a result of formula one and , in particular , signing the star driver .
" the whole issue will sell many cars and the caliber of the star will make a lot of people sit up and pay attention , " said haug .
the investment will not pay off for the company according to ferdinand dudenhoeffer , an economics professor at the university of duisburg-essen who specializes in the car industry .
he questions whether customers will buy a mercedes based on the fact that the brand had a formula one presence .
" you can hardly comprehend it . they will have to charge about 200 to 300 euros more for every car sold , to finance the formula one campaign for mercedes .
mercedes is a company for which sportiness is not the main selling point , it is instead based on safety and on quality on the road . "
rush on race tickets despite this , many german fans are euphoric at the news – with a rush on tickets for the race at hockenheim next july .
formula one supremo bernie ecclestone hailed the news as " fantastic " and predicted a " jaw-dropping season . "
" i think it is fantastic for formula one that he turned into a comeback kid but at the same time i also think it 's good for michael , " said ecclestone .
" when drivers have put in many years they sometimes lose focus and motivation – probably that was one of the reasons for his retirement in 2006 – but now he has again put all his strength together and has a 100 percent motivation level and that will give us many exciting races in 2010 .
forget about winning races – i have him on my bill for winning the championship . "

" obviously our only goal can be to fight for the world championship , " he told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
he said he has " no doubt " about his skills behind the wheel .
" i never stopped my physical training , " he said .
support from home schumacher can count on the full support of his wife of 14 years corinna .
" he knows exactly what he is doing and he knows that i am always behind him , " she said .
" he needs his challenges ; that 's just michael .
i understand it and i think it 's really great . "
she acknowledged that family life would be turned upside down , but said that when her husband told her of the call he had from his former and new team boss ross brawn " i immediately sensed that there was this fire burning inside him that i know so well .

for over 20 years , postal workers have written back . it 's a tradition for young children around the world to send letters to santa claus with their wishes for christmas .
german children , however , practice a slightly different tradition .
they often send letters to the christkind , who is responsible for bringing the presents on christmas .
the christkind is a symbolic representation of the christmas spirit that is often depicted as a christmas angel .
many of those letters land in a small town in western germany called engelskirchen .
translated , the town 's name means " angels ' church " - a fitting name for the seasonal home of a christmas post office .
the post office , located on the town 's aptly named " angels ' square , " is one of six official addresses in germany for letters addressed to the christkind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans picture the christkind as a kind of fairy , or angel the tradition started in 1985 , when other post offices around germany were n't sure what to do with letters addressed to the christkind .
" since engelskirchen was such a nice name , they ended up just sending them there , " said britta toellner , a spokeswoman for germany 's mail carrier deutsche post .
" and at the time , there was a manager here who opened the letters and saw that they were christmas lists , so just for fun , she answered a few . "
the christkind 's new home before long , a few turned into many , as mountains of letters started arriving in engelskirchen .
the postal workers started taking letters home with them to write responses to children hoping to hear from the christkind .
but at some point , it got to be too much to handle as a side project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letters come in from all over the world " we were getting so many letters from all corners of the earth that we decided to get organized , " toeller said .
" during the holidays , we rent an office and have up to 12 helpers who answer the thousands of letters that come every day . "
last year , 145,000 letters were sent to the christmas post office in engelskirchen , and the number is expected to grow this year .
most of the letters are classic christmas wish lists , with requests ranging from toys to companionship in the form of pets or siblings .
wish lists answers to the letters are written very diplomatically , explaining for instance that not every wish can be granted .
but the postal workers try and include a small gift to tide the children over until christmas , such as small paper cut-outs .
while many children ask the christkind to bring them presents , the christmas post office often receives personal and endearing messages from children .
" for example , kids will ask ' can you say hello to my mother ?
she 's in heaven and lives with you there . '
those letters are tough to take , " said toeller .
" increasingly , they are also thinking of the bigger picture .
we used to see lots of messages for peace on earth and goodwill toward people , which they often simply picked up somewhere , but now kids are noticing that something is not quite right with the environment .
and they speak their minds about it . "
the letters come from all over the world , some from countries as far away as australia , japan , or togo .
no matter where they come from , children write to the christkind in the spirit of christmas .
and in that same spirit , the workers at germany 's christmas post office in engelskirchen write back .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 24.12.2009 ugandan president softens anti-gay bill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president is said to be responding to concerns of uganda 's western partners ugandan president yoweri museveni says he will intervene to soften a anti-gay legislation that proposes homosexuals should be imprisoned or put to death .
this comes after much international criticism over the bill . in its current form , the bill proposes life imprisonment and even the death penalty for gays and lesbians in uganda .
museveni 's top aide said on thursday that the president was planning to intervene to address the concerns of uganda 's western partners who have expressed strong opposition to the bill .
" we should not have an extreme position .
the president will harmonize the two sides and address the concerns of the europeans and our other development partners . " said museveni 's spokesman .
international condemnation the bill , which is yet to be debated in uganda 's parliament , would have gay men and lesbians sentenced to life in prison for having sex .
in cases of sex with minors or sexual acts leading to hiv infection , the penalty would be death .
the bill also proposes that anyone who fails to report a homosexual act committed by others would face up to three years in jail .
international reaction to the bill has been widespread condemnation , with some western states threatening to withdraw aid to uganda if the government passes the bill into law .
there has also been outcry from the country 's small gay and lesbian community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : church groups worldwide have condemned the bill the world council of churches -lrb- wcc -rrb- has also criticized the bill , saying it would run against basic christian teaching by promoting hatred .
" from the experience of many nations , it is very clear that if such a bill is enacted into law , it will leave a lot of room for manipulation , abuse , blackmail and oppression of people " said wcc chief samuel kobia .
a top anglican cleric of ugandan decent in the uk , archbishop of york john sentamu , said he was " totally opposed to the death sentence " and found the language being used to describe homosexuals " upsetting " .
uganda denies bowing to the west uganda 's ethics and integrity minister nsaba buturo said the revised law would most likely make life in prison the maximum penalty for offenders .
" there have been a lot of discussions in government regarding the proposed law , but we now think a life sentence could be better because it gives room for offenders to be rehabilitated , " he said .
" killing them might not be helpful , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east-african state has benefitted from western aid and investment however , buturo denied the change in government attitude was forced by western pressure .
" it 's really out of our consultation with various groups , including religious leaders .
it has nothing to do with external forces , " he said .
buturo also added that uganda had not changed its view that homosexuality is a " moral perversion that must not be allowed to spread " .
uganda has long benefitted from western aid and investment due to its stable economy and widespread economic reforms. mk / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however he defended the little progress that was made at the meeting of representatives from over 190 countries .
" i think that people are justified in being disappointed about the outcome in copenhagen , " obama told pbs television wednesday after the summit ended with only vague prescriptions to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
" the science says that we 've got to significantly reduce emissions over the next 40 years .
there 's nothing in the copenhagen agreement that ensures that that happens , " he acknowledged .
but obama added : " what i said was essentially that rather than see a complete collapse in copenhagen ... at least we kind of held ground and there was n't too much backsliding from where we were . "
the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre .

this comes after much international criticism over the bill . in its current form , the bill proposes life imprisonment and even the death penalty for gays and lesbians in uganda .
museveni 's top aide said on thursday that the president was planning to intervene to address the concerns of uganda 's western partners who have expressed strong opposition to the bill .
" we should not have an extreme position .

in cases of sex with minors or sexual acts leading to hiv infection , the penalty would be death .
the bill also proposes that anyone who fails to report a homosexual act committed by others would face up to three years in jail .

those detained on the grounds of links with a militant group included local mayors . anti-terrorism squads in turkey conducted raids in 11 cities , arresting 43 campaigners and members of the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , said aides of the chief state prosecutor in the south-eastern city of diyarbakir .
among those arrested in the early-morning operation were several prominent politicians , including at least seven local mayors , and two-human rights activists .
according to some accounts from kurdish sources , the number arrested was between 60 and 80 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was unrest when the dtp was banned early in december turkey 's constitutional court banned the dtp on december 11 on the grounds of links with the kurdistan workers ' party , known as the pkk .
the pkk is a separatist militant group , which is regarded by the european union as a terrorist organization .
among those held in diyarbakir was a lawyer for the jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan .
raids across country the raids took place in cities across the southeast of the country as well as in istanbul and the capital , ankara .
the ban on the dtp , which led to days of unrest in kurdish areas of turkey , was opposed by prime minister tayyip erdogan .

georgian-russian relations have been strained since a short war fought last year . ties between russia and georgia appeared to be improving on thursday after a swiss-brokered deal resulted in a plan to reopen a mountain pass on the border .
all border crossings and flights between the two nations have been closed since the august war fought in 2008 .
" according to our preliminary verbal agreement with the russian side , the verkhny lars checkpoint will open in early march , " georgian deputy foreign minister nino kalandadze told a news conference .
georgia and russia fought a brief war last year over the georgian breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
opening up the border would be the first sign of thaw in diplomatic ties between russia and georgia which were severed after the war .
the russian border service also released a statement citing the " shared need to resume international traffic between georgia and russia . "
all is not forgiven moscow has repeatedly asserted , however , that it would not resume official relations with georgia as long as president mikheil saakashvili remains in power .
kalandadze said the agreement would allow georgian citizens and cargo to cross the border and that a formal protocol on reopening the crossing would be finalized within two weeks .
on tuesday , georgian airlines airzena asked the russian government to allow it to run charter flights between tbilisi and moscow during the winter holiday period .
approximately one million georgians live in russia .
" we assess the resumption of air links positively .
we hope that negotiations between private air companies on resumption of flights will result in a positive decision , " kalandadze said. sjt / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's rail operator deutsche bahn announced on wednesday that only one out of two regularly scheduled trains would be running on the high speed ice route connecting berlin , leipzig and munich until after christmas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramsauer says delays are ' more than annoying ' the reason : excessive snow and ice have taken too many trains out of action .
trains ' not built for these temperatures ' " the trains are not built to withstand these siberian temperatures , " deutsche bahn spokesman joerg boehnisch said , referring to temperatures dropping to minus 20 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
according to boehnisch , the technical failures on the ice trains are similar to those that brought eurostar trains , which run between london , brussels and paris , to a standstill this past weekend .
" a series of trains have broken down because , as with the eurostar trains , dry powder snow is drawn through the ventilation grill into the train and can affect the electrical components , " he explained .
transport minister acknowledges problem travelers whose trains are delayed up to an hour will receive a 25 percent reduction of their fare while those who must wait two hours will be given 50 percent of their ticket price back .
passengers who are unable to complete their journey because their train has been cancelled will be reimbursed completely .

a new german study of organic and ethical fashion shows the growing industry is n't all it 's cracked up to be - especially when it comes to verifying adherence to " green " standards . recent years have seen a boom in the the organic , socially conscious textile industry .
small ethical t-shirt companies are shooting up left and right , and even big producers like hennes & mauritz have jumped on the bandwagon , making a line of organic cotton clothes .
in light of this , the german non-profit organization suedwind tested these companies to see if they delivered what they advertised - and to what extent .
questionnaires were sent out to 240 companies whose ecologically or socially conscious products can be ordered online in germany .
just 23 companies - 17 of them german - responded .
verification is an issue suedwind said the aim of the study was to see how closely the companies complied with generally accepted industry standards for ethical production , such as widespread international labor organization conventions and fair-trade labelling rules , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fairtrade is one of several groups out to verify compliance " many companies call themselves green , or ethical or fair , " said dominic kloos , who ran the suedwind study .
" but are they really ethical or ecological ?
that 's what we wanted to find out . "
kloos acknowledged that the low rate of response meant the study shows " tendencies " rather than giving a full picture of the industry .
but overall , despite progress , he said the results showed that " many … complied with some of the most important standards , but not with all of them . "
seven ' green ' criteria the suedwind study examined seven criteria , from checking ecological standards -lrb- are all components certified organic ? -rrb- and social ones -lrb- does the company comply with the " clean clothes campaign " code of conduct throughout its entire production chain ? -rrb- .
it also looked at verification measures , transparency levels , raw materials sourcing , and the chemical content of the clothes , among others .
" the main outcome is that ecological standards are easier to verify than social ones , " kloos said .
while environmental standards can be verified by certification agencies , social standards can only be upheld if a company is a member of a so-called multi-stakeholder initiative , or if they are a cooperative , " which means the work standards are in the workers ' hands , " kloos said .
overall , the study showed that 69 percent of the companies said they fulfilled basic social conventions , while 22 percent in accordance with listed ecological standards .
of those , 35 percent had external verification procedures for ecological standards - but only four of the 23 companies said they externally verified social standards .
raising the bar kloos acknowledged that his job is to " raise the bar very high " when shining a light on company behaviors .
but the fact that eco-clothing companies exist at all is a good sign for the future of the textile industry : " it 's great that these niche companies exist - they put pressure on the market , so that bigger companies , like h & m , come out with organic clothing , " he said .
ultimately , though , we do n't need to improve social and ecological standards on a voluntary basis , kloos said .
" what we need is legally binding rules . "

a new german study of organic and ethical fashion shows the growing industry is n't all it 's cracked up to be - especially when it comes to verifying adherence to " green " standards . recent years have seen a boom in the the organic , socially conscious textile industry .
small ethical t-shirt companies are shooting up left and right , and even big producers like hennes & mauritz have jumped on the bandwagon , making a line of organic cotton clothes .
in light of this , the german non-profit organization suedwind tested these companies to see if they delivered what they advertised - and to what extent .
questionnaires were sent out to 240 companies whose ecologically or socially conscious products can be ordered online in germany .
just 23 companies - 17 of them german - responded .
verification is an issue suedwind said the aim of the study was to see how closely the companies complied with generally accepted industry standards for ethical production , such as widespread international labor organization conventions and fair-trade labelling rules , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fairtrade is one of several groups out to verify compliance " many companies call themselves green , or ethical or fair , " said dominic kloos , who ran the suedwind study .
" but are they really ethical or ecological ?
that 's what we wanted to find out . "
kloos acknowledged that the low rate of response meant the study shows " tendencies " rather than giving a full picture of the industry .
but overall , despite progress , he said the results showed that " many … complied with some of the most important standards , but not with all of them . "
seven ' green ' criteria the suedwind study examined seven criteria , from checking ecological standards -lrb- are all components certified organic ? -rrb- and social ones -lrb- does the company comply with the " clean clothes campaign " code of conduct throughout its entire production chain ? -rrb- .
it also looked at verification measures , transparency levels , raw materials sourcing , and the chemical content of the clothes , among others .
" the main outcome is that ecological standards are easier to verify than social ones , " kloos said .
while environmental standards can be verified by certification agencies , social standards can only be upheld if a company is a member of a so-called multi-stakeholder initiative , or if they are a cooperative , " which means the work standards are in the workers ' hands , " kloos said .
overall , the study showed that 69 percent of the companies said they fulfilled basic social conventions , while 22 percent in accordance with listed ecological standards .
of those , 35 percent had external verification procedures for ecological standards - but only four of the 23 companies said they externally verified social standards .
raising the bar kloos acknowledged that his job is to " raise the bar very high " when shining a light on company behaviors .
but the fact that eco-clothing companies exist at all is a good sign for the future of the textile industry : " it 's great that these niche companies exist - they put pressure on the market , so that bigger companies , like h & m , come out with organic clothing , " he said .
ultimately , though , we do n't need to improve social and ecological standards on a voluntary basis , kloos said .
" what we need is legally binding rules . "

this comes after much international criticism over the bill . in its current form , the bill proposes life imprisonment and even the death penalty for gays and lesbians in uganda .
museveni 's top aide said on thursday that the president was planning to intervene to address the concerns of uganda 's western partners who have expressed strong opposition to the bill .
" we should not have an extreme position .
the president will harmonize the two sides and address the concerns of the europeans and our other development partners . " said museveni 's spokesman .
international condemnation the bill , which is yet to be debated in uganda 's parliament , would have gay men and lesbians sentenced to life in prison for having sex .
in cases of sex with minors or sexual acts leading to hiv infection , the penalty would be death .
the bill also proposes that anyone who fails to report a homosexual act committed by others would face up to three years in jail .
international reaction to the bill has been widespread condemnation , with some western states threatening to withdraw aid to uganda if the government passes the bill into law .
there has also been outcry from the country 's small gay and lesbian community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : church groups worldwide have condemned the bill the world council of churches -lrb- wcc -rrb- has also criticized the bill , saying it would run against basic christian teaching by promoting hatred .
" from the experience of many nations , it is very clear that if such a bill is enacted into law , it will leave a lot of room for manipulation , abuse , blackmail and oppression of people " said wcc chief samuel kobia .
a top anglican cleric of ugandan decent in the uk , archbishop of york john sentamu , said he was " totally opposed to the death sentence " and found the language being used to describe homosexuals " upsetting " .
uganda denies bowing to the west uganda 's ethics and integrity minister nsaba buturo said the revised law would most likely make life in prison the maximum penalty for offenders .
" there have been a lot of discussions in government regarding the proposed law , but we now think a life sentence could be better because it gives room for offenders to be rehabilitated , " he said .
" killing them might not be helpful , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east-african state has benefitted from western aid and investment however , buturo denied the change in government attitude was forced by western pressure .
" it 's really out of our consultation with various groups , including religious leaders .
it has nothing to do with external forces , " he said .
buturo also added that uganda had not changed its view that homosexuality is a " moral perversion that must not be allowed to spread " .
uganda has long benefitted from western aid and investment due to its stable economy and widespread economic reforms. mk / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 24.12.2009 ' dear christkind ' : a german post office answers christmas letters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of letters arrive every christmas in engelskirchen in the small town of engelskirchen , thousands of letters from around the world arrive at a seasonal christmas post office , all addressed to one person .
for over 20 years , postal workers have written back . it 's a tradition for young children around the world to send letters to santa claus with their wishes for christmas .
german children , however , practice a slightly different tradition .
they often send letters to the christkind , who is responsible for bringing the presents on christmas .
the christkind is a symbolic representation of the christmas spirit that is often depicted as a christmas angel .
many of those letters land in a small town in western germany called engelskirchen .
translated , the town 's name means " angels ' church " - a fitting name for the seasonal home of a christmas post office .
the post office , located on the town 's aptly named " angels ' square , " is one of six official addresses in germany for letters addressed to the christkind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans picture the christkind as a kind of fairy , or angel the tradition started in 1985 , when other post offices around germany were n't sure what to do with letters addressed to the christkind .
" since engelskirchen was such a nice name , they ended up just sending them there , " said britta toellner , a spokeswoman for germany 's mail carrier deutsche post .
" and at the time , there was a manager here who opened the letters and saw that they were christmas lists , so just for fun , she answered a few . "
the christkind 's new home before long , a few turned into many , as mountains of letters started arriving in engelskirchen .
the postal workers started taking letters home with them to write responses to children hoping to hear from the christkind .
but at some point , it got to be too much to handle as a side project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letters come in from all over the world " we were getting so many letters from all corners of the earth that we decided to get organized , " toeller said .
" during the holidays , we rent an office and have up to 12 helpers who answer the thousands of letters that come every day . "
last year , 145,000 letters were sent to the christmas post office in engelskirchen , and the number is expected to grow this year .
most of the letters are classic christmas wish lists , with requests ranging from toys to companionship in the form of pets or siblings .
wish lists answers to the letters are written very diplomatically , explaining for instance that not every wish can be granted .
but the postal workers try and include a small gift to tide the children over until christmas , such as small paper cut-outs .
while many children ask the christkind to bring them presents , the christmas post office often receives personal and endearing messages from children .
" for example , kids will ask ' can you say hello to my mother ?
she 's in heaven and lives with you there . '
those letters are tough to take , " said toeller .
" increasingly , they are also thinking of the bigger picture .
we used to see lots of messages for peace on earth and goodwill toward people , which they often simply picked up somewhere , but now kids are noticing that something is not quite right with the environment .
and they speak their minds about it . "
the letters come from all over the world , some from countries as far away as australia , japan , or togo .
no matter where they come from , children write to the christkind in the spirit of christmas .
and in that same spirit , the workers at germany 's christmas post office in engelskirchen write back .

however he defended the little progress that was made at the meeting of representatives from over 190 countries .
" i think that people are justified in being disappointed about the outcome in copenhagen , " obama told pbs television wednesday after the summit ended with only vague prescriptions to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
" the science says that we 've got to significantly reduce emissions over the next 40 years .
there 's nothing in the copenhagen agreement that ensures that that happens , " he acknowledged .
but obama added : " what i said was essentially that rather than see a complete collapse in copenhagen ... at least we kind of held ground and there was n't too much backsliding from where we were . "
the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel said observers should refrain from " bad mouthing " the summit outcome but it prompted criticism for not setting tough , legally binding limits on future carbon emissions for the 193 nations present .
finger pointing earlier this week the european union sought to shift much of the blame for the outcome of the summit on the us and china , the world 's two largest emitters of carbon dioxide which most scientists believe is a leading cause of anthropogenic climate change .
sweden , which currently holds the eu presidency , described the copenhagen agreement as a disaster for the environment , while german chancellor angela merkel was slightly more upbeat , commenting that the accord was something that " now needed to be built upon . "
in the aftermath of the conference developed and developing nations have traded blows over who was to blame for the weak deal that was reached .
britain accused china of hijacking the proceedings , while brazil attacked the perceived lack of commitment shown by washington .
in turn , india harangued australia for being an " ayatollah of the single track , " and small island nations like tuvalu accused rich nations of blatant disregard for their plight. dfm / afp / reuters editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's rail operator deutsche bahn announced on wednesday that only one out of two regularly scheduled trains would be running on the high speed ice route connecting berlin , leipzig and munich until after christmas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramsauer says delays are ' more than annoying ' the reason : excessive snow and ice have taken too many trains out of action .
trains ' not built for these temperatures ' " the trains are not built to withstand these siberian temperatures , " deutsche bahn spokesman joerg boehnisch said , referring to temperatures dropping to minus 20 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
according to boehnisch , the technical failures on the ice trains are similar to those that brought eurostar trains , which run between london , brussels and paris , to a standstill this past weekend .
" a series of trains have broken down because , as with the eurostar trains , dry powder snow is drawn through the ventilation grill into the train and can affect the electrical components , " he explained .
transport minister acknowledges problem travelers whose trains are delayed up to an hour will receive a 25 percent reduction of their fare while those who must wait two hours will be given 50 percent of their ticket price back .
passengers who are unable to complete their journey because their train has been cancelled will be reimbursed completely .
german transport minister peter ramsauer told daily sueddeutsche zeitung that for many passengers the timetable issues were " more than annoying .

images of the holy family , stars and religious songs were manipulated to take the " christ " out of christmas . christmas is a high point in the religious calendar for germans .
many of the traditions , images and songs enjoyed around the world have their roots in the christmas celebrations of german speaking countries .
sparkling stars on the tree , a fair-haired and angelic baby , brightly-wrapped presents and joyful carols sung by church choirs are all parts of the celebrations on dec .
24 , the day marking the birth of jesus christ . between 1933 and 1945 , under the third reich , christmas was just as popular as it is today .
but honoring the birth of a jewish baby - who was celebrated as the christian savior - was difficult for nazis to embrace .
as a result , national socialist ideologues decided to remove christian symbolism from the celebration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis aimed to take the jewish baby , jesus , out of christmas " celebrating the birth of a jewish baby was unthinkable for the nazis , " said juergen mueller , the chief researcher behind the exhibit " not such a holy night " at the national socialism documentation center in cologne , which documents christmas tradition during the third reich . but christmas was too popular even during the nazi period to be banned , mueller told deutsche welle . " they therefore decided to corrupt it . " initially nazi officials had tried to reject all christian traditions .
they renamed the festival julfest and propagated the germanic origins of the winter celebration of light on december 21 , the winter solstice . but for the majority of germans , the christian traditions were still the basis of the holiday . mueller said nazi officials then took inspiration from classical images showing a baby jesus with his loving parents , mary and joseph .
they reinterpreted this as a model aryan family , an image which the nazis had elevated to the highest levels during the late 1930s .
so for the nazis , the family rather than jesus became the center of the christmas celebrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the nazis , grenade- shaped ornaments replaced stars churches in germany , although outraged by the nazis ' fervent efforts to undermine beliefs central to christianity , were powerless to protest what was happening . " the reaction of the church was not very strong .
at about 1936-1937 , the nazi government was so powerful that the possibility of protest was extremely low , " mueller said .
" the church could n't really condemn it or protest against it , although it stuck to the christian traditions within itself , " he added . nazi christmas tree decorations no aspect of the christmas celebrations was free of nazi symbolism .
the tree , which has long been a central component of german christmas festivities , was stripped of its traditional decorations .
stars , angels , bells , fruit and candy were replaced with swastikas and ornaments shaped like miniature cannons , grenades and fighter planes .
at the top of the tree , instead of a star or angel , firm adherents to the nazi doctrine placed a soaring golden eagle , the german national symbol .
parents wrapped their children 's presents in brightly colored paper with nazi symbols . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandizing christmas in germany dates back to wwi the most difficult of images for the nazis to undermine was the star .
a six-pointed christmas star was too similar to the yellow star the jews were required to wear ; and a five-pointed star resembled the red star of the soviets .
as a result , the nazis banned stars completely from christmas tree decorations .
geometric shapes embossed with swastikas or germanic symbols were used instead . popular christmas carols were also rendered christianity-free by nazi composers .
barbara kirschbaum , one of the staff members at the ns documentation center , told deutsche welle : " the nazis tried to ban some of the christmas carols with open christian content . " " some of the songs got new lyrics , some were completely recreated , " she said . " hohe nacht der klaren sterne " -lrb- " high night of bright stars " -rrb- is one of the songs newly created by the nazis .
one transformed song , " es ist fuer uns eine zeit angekommen " -lrb- " the time has come for us " -rrb- , is still popular in the nazi version .
people sing it even in churches , not being aware of the history of the lyrics , " kirschbaum said . public reaction for kirschbaum , the purpose of the exhibition is to discover what can be learned from the way the nazis manipulated christmas imagery .
she said people need to understand that history is shaped by people , and that propaganda is used to rewrite history .
when the visitors see this in the exhibit , it will increase their awareness of what happened under the nazis , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas wreath redone in nazi style " older visitors at first are usually touched by their childhood memories , which are reawakened by the objects .
but slowly they see the purpose behind the things , something they often did n't realize when they were young .
and this frightens them , to see how things were used and how their beliefs as children were used for propaganda purposes , " said kirschbaum . angelika wasserburger , a 51-year-old visitor to the exhibition from nuremberg , found the reality very uncomfortable . " i think it 's very frightening to realize how many of our traditions , how many of our symbols , have this origin which we do n't realize anymore .
and it 's very frightening also to realize the misuse that has been implemented with those symbols and traditions , " she told deutsche welle . the reaction of younger visitors to the exhibition is even stronger . jonas rahimi , a 15-year-old who came to the exhibition on a school trip , was shocked by how deeply nazism left its imprint on christmas celebrations in germany . " the nazis really involved their radical views in every part of life .
there was even a little war game for kids .
it 's very shocking to me , " he said . " i think it 's very important that the people here in cologne remember what happened here because it was very crucial and you should not forget it , " he added . author : faith thomas editor : kristin zeier / jen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result , national socialist ideologues decided to remove christian symbolism from the celebration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis aimed to take the jewish baby , jesus , out of christmas " celebrating the birth of a jewish baby was unthinkable for the nazis , " said juergen mueller , the chief researcher behind the exhibit " not such a holy night " at the national socialism documentation center in cologne , which documents christmas tradition during the third reich . but christmas was too popular even during the nazi period to be banned , mueller told deutsche welle . " they therefore decided to corrupt it . " initially nazi officials had tried to reject all christian traditions .
they renamed the festival julfest and propagated the germanic origins of the winter celebration of light on december 21 , the winter solstice . but for the majority of germans , the christian traditions were still the basis of the holiday . mueller said nazi officials then took inspiration from classical images showing a baby jesus with his loving parents , mary and joseph .
they reinterpreted this as a model aryan family , an image which the nazis had elevated to the highest levels during the late 1930s .
so for the nazis , the family rather than jesus became the center of the christmas celebrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the nazis , grenade- shaped ornaments replaced stars churches in germany , although outraged by the nazis ' fervent efforts to undermine beliefs central to christianity , were powerless to protest what was happening . " the reaction of the church was not very strong .
at about 1936-1937 , the nazi government was so powerful that the possibility of protest was extremely low , " mueller said .
" the church could n't really condemn it or protest against it , although it stuck to the christian traditions within itself , " he added . nazi christmas tree decorations no aspect of the christmas celebrations was free of nazi symbolism .
the tree , which has long been a central component of german christmas festivities , was stripped of its traditional decorations .
stars , angels , bells , fruit and candy were replaced with swastikas and ornaments shaped like miniature cannons , grenades and fighter planes .
at the top of the tree , instead of a star or angel , firm adherents to the nazi doctrine placed a soaring golden eagle , the german national symbol .
parents wrapped their children 's presents in brightly colored paper with nazi symbols . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandizing christmas in germany dates back to wwi the most difficult of images for the nazis to undermine was the star .
a six-pointed christmas star was too similar to the yellow star the jews were required to wear ; and a five-pointed star resembled the red star of the soviets .
as a result , the nazis banned stars completely from christmas tree decorations .
geometric shapes embossed with swastikas or germanic symbols were used instead . popular christmas carols were also rendered christianity-free by nazi composers .
barbara kirschbaum , one of the staff members at the ns documentation center , told deutsche welle : " the nazis tried to ban some of the christmas carols with open christian content . " " some of the songs got new lyrics , some were completely recreated , " she said . " hohe nacht der klaren sterne " -lrb- " high night of bright stars " -rrb- is one of the songs newly created by the nazis .
one transformed song , " es ist fuer uns eine zeit angekommen " -lrb- " the time has come for us " -rrb- , is still popular in the nazi version .
people sing it even in churches , not being aware of the history of the lyrics , " kirschbaum said . public reaction for kirschbaum , the purpose of the exhibition is to discover what can be learned from the way the nazis manipulated christmas imagery .
she said people need to understand that history is shaped by people , and that propaganda is used to rewrite history .
when the visitors see this in the exhibit , it will increase their awareness of what happened under the nazis , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas wreath redone in nazi style " older visitors at first are usually touched by their childhood memories , which are reawakened by the objects .
but slowly they see the purpose behind the things , something they often did n't realize when they were young .
and this frightens them , to see how things were used and how their beliefs as children were used for propaganda purposes , " said kirschbaum . angelika wasserburger , a 51-year-old visitor to the exhibition from nuremberg , found the reality very uncomfortable . " i think it 's very frightening to realize how many of our traditions , how many of our symbols , have this origin which we do n't realize anymore .
and it 's very frightening also to realize the misuse that has been implemented with those symbols and traditions , " she told deutsche welle . the reaction of younger visitors to the exhibition is even stronger . jonas rahimi , a 15-year-old who came to the exhibition on a school trip , was shocked by how deeply nazism left its imprint on christmas celebrations in germany . " the nazis really involved their radical views in every part of life .
there was even a little war game for kids .
it 's very shocking to me , " he said . " i think it 's very important that the people here in cologne remember what happened here because it was very crucial and you should not forget it , " he added . author : faith thomas editor : kristin zeier / jen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes after much international criticism over the bill . in its current form , the bill proposes life imprisonment and even the death penalty for gays and lesbians in uganda .
museveni 's top aide said on thursday that the president was planning to intervene to address the concerns of uganda 's western partners who have expressed strong opposition to the bill .
" we should not have an extreme position .
the president will harmonize the two sides and address the concerns of the europeans and our other development partners . " said museveni 's spokesman .
international condemnation the bill , which is yet to be debated in uganda 's parliament , would have gay men and lesbians sentenced to life in prison for having sex .
in cases of sex with minors or sexual acts leading to hiv infection , the penalty would be death .
the bill also proposes that anyone who fails to report a homosexual act committed by others would face up to three years in jail .
international reaction to the bill has been widespread condemnation , with some western states threatening to withdraw aid to uganda if the government passes the bill into law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 24.12.2009 ' dear christkind ' : a german post office answers christmas letters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of letters arrive every christmas in engelskirchen in the small town of engelskirchen , thousands of letters from around the world arrive at a seasonal christmas post office , all addressed to one person .
for over 20 years , postal workers have written back . it 's a tradition for young children around the world to send letters to santa claus with their wishes for christmas .
german children , however , practice a slightly different tradition .
they often send letters to the christkind , who is responsible for bringing the presents on christmas .
the christkind is a symbolic representation of the christmas spirit that is often depicted as a christmas angel .
many of those letters land in a small town in western germany called engelskirchen .
translated , the town 's name means " angels ' church " - a fitting name for the seasonal home of a christmas post office .
the post office , located on the town 's aptly named " angels ' square , " is one of six official addresses in germany for letters addressed to the christkind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans picture the christkind as a kind of fairy , or angel the tradition started in 1985 , when other post offices around germany were n't sure what to do with letters addressed to the christkind .
" since engelskirchen was such a nice name , they ended up just sending them there , " said britta toellner , a spokeswoman for germany 's mail carrier deutsche post .
" and at the time , there was a manager here who opened the letters and saw that they were christmas lists , so just for fun , she answered a few . "
the christkind 's new home before long , a few turned into many , as mountains of letters started arriving in engelskirchen .
the postal workers started taking letters home with them to write responses to children hoping to hear from the christkind .
but at some point , it got to be too much to handle as a side project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letters come in from all over the world " we were getting so many letters from all corners of the earth that we decided to get organized , " toeller said .
" during the holidays , we rent an office and have up to 12 helpers who answer the thousands of letters that come every day . "
last year , 145,000 letters were sent to the christmas post office in engelskirchen , and the number is expected to grow this year .
most of the letters are classic christmas wish lists , with requests ranging from toys to companionship in the form of pets or siblings .
wish lists answers to the letters are written very diplomatically , explaining for instance that not every wish can be granted .
but the postal workers try and include a small gift to tide the children over until christmas , such as small paper cut-outs .
while many children ask the christkind to bring them presents , the christmas post office often receives personal and endearing messages from children .
" for example , kids will ask ' can you say hello to my mother ?
she 's in heaven and lives with you there . '
those letters are tough to take , " said toeller .
" increasingly , they are also thinking of the bigger picture .
we used to see lots of messages for peace on earth and goodwill toward people , which they often simply picked up somewhere , but now kids are noticing that something is not quite right with the environment .
and they speak their minds about it . "
the letters come from all over the world , some from countries as far away as australia , japan , or togo .
no matter where they come from , children write to the christkind in the spirit of christmas .
and in that same spirit , the workers at germany 's christmas post office in engelskirchen write back .

images of the holy family , stars and religious songs were manipulated to take the " christ " out of christmas . christmas is a high point in the religious calendar for germans .
many of the traditions , images and songs enjoyed around the world have their roots in the christmas celebrations of german speaking countries .
sparkling stars on the tree , a fair-haired and angelic baby , brightly-wrapped presents and joyful carols sung by church choirs are all parts of the celebrations on dec .
24 , the day marking the birth of jesus christ . between 1933 and 1945 , under the third reich , christmas was just as popular as it is today .

images of the holy family , stars and religious songs were manipulated to take the " christ " out of christmas . christmas is a high point in the religious calendar for germans .
many of the traditions , images and songs enjoyed around the world have their roots in the christmas celebrations of german speaking countries .
sparkling stars on the tree , a fair-haired and angelic baby , brightly-wrapped presents and joyful carols sung by church choirs are all parts of the celebrations on dec .
24 , the day marking the birth of jesus christ . between 1933 and 1945 , under the third reich , christmas was just as popular as it is today .
but honoring the birth of a jewish baby - who was celebrated as the christian savior - was difficult for nazis to embrace .
as a result , national socialist ideologues decided to remove christian symbolism from the celebration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis aimed to take the jewish baby , jesus , out of christmas " celebrating the birth of a jewish baby was unthinkable for the nazis , " said juergen mueller , the chief researcher behind the exhibit " not such a holy night " at the national socialism documentation center in cologne , which documents christmas tradition during the third reich . but christmas was too popular even during the nazi period to be banned , mueller told deutsche welle . " they therefore decided to corrupt it . " initially nazi officials had tried to reject all christian traditions .
they renamed the festival julfest and propagated the germanic origins of the winter celebration of light on december 21 , the winter solstice . but for the majority of germans , the christian traditions were still the basis of the holiday . mueller said nazi officials then took inspiration from classical images showing a baby jesus with his loving parents , mary and joseph .
they reinterpreted this as a model aryan family , an image which the nazis had elevated to the highest levels during the late 1930s .
so for the nazis , the family rather than jesus became the center of the christmas celebrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the nazis , grenade- shaped ornaments replaced stars churches in germany , although outraged by the nazis ' fervent efforts to undermine beliefs central to christianity , were powerless to protest what was happening . " the reaction of the church was not very strong .
at about 1936-1937 , the nazi government was so powerful that the possibility of protest was extremely low , " mueller said .
" the church could n't really condemn it or protest against it , although it stuck to the christian traditions within itself , " he added . nazi christmas tree decorations no aspect of the christmas celebrations was free of nazi symbolism .
the tree , which has long been a central component of german christmas festivities , was stripped of its traditional decorations .
stars , angels , bells , fruit and candy were replaced with swastikas and ornaments shaped like miniature cannons , grenades and fighter planes .
at the top of the tree , instead of a star or angel , firm adherents to the nazi doctrine placed a soaring golden eagle , the german national symbol .
parents wrapped their children 's presents in brightly colored paper with nazi symbols . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandizing christmas in germany dates back to wwi the most difficult of images for the nazis to undermine was the star .
a six-pointed christmas star was too similar to the yellow star the jews were required to wear ; and a five-pointed star resembled the red star of the soviets .
as a result , the nazis banned stars completely from christmas tree decorations .
geometric shapes embossed with swastikas or germanic symbols were used instead . popular christmas carols were also rendered christianity-free by nazi composers .
barbara kirschbaum , one of the staff members at the ns documentation center , told deutsche welle : " the nazis tried to ban some of the christmas carols with open christian content . " " some of the songs got new lyrics , some were completely recreated , " she said . " hohe nacht der klaren sterne " -lrb- " high night of bright stars " -rrb- is one of the songs newly created by the nazis .
one transformed song , " es ist fuer uns eine zeit angekommen " -lrb- " the time has come for us " -rrb- , is still popular in the nazi version .
people sing it even in churches , not being aware of the history of the lyrics , " kirschbaum said . public reaction for kirschbaum , the purpose of the exhibition is to discover what can be learned from the way the nazis manipulated christmas imagery .
she said people need to understand that history is shaped by people , and that propaganda is used to rewrite history .
when the visitors see this in the exhibit , it will increase their awareness of what happened under the nazis , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas wreath redone in nazi style " older visitors at first are usually touched by their childhood memories , which are reawakened by the objects .
but slowly they see the purpose behind the things , something they often did n't realize when they were young .
and this frightens them , to see how things were used and how their beliefs as children were used for propaganda purposes , " said kirschbaum . angelika wasserburger , a 51-year-old visitor to the exhibition from nuremberg , found the reality very uncomfortable . " i think it 's very frightening to realize how many of our traditions , how many of our symbols , have this origin which we do n't realize anymore .
and it 's very frightening also to realize the misuse that has been implemented with those symbols and traditions , " she told deutsche welle . the reaction of younger visitors to the exhibition is even stronger . jonas rahimi , a 15-year-old who came to the exhibition on a school trip , was shocked by how deeply nazism left its imprint on christmas celebrations in germany . " the nazis really involved their radical views in every part of life .
there was even a little war game for kids .
it 's very shocking to me , " he said . " i think it 's very important that the people here in cologne remember what happened here because it was very crucial and you should not forget it , " he added . author : faith thomas editor : kristin zeier / jen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

georgian-russian relations have been strained since a short war fought last year . ties between russia and georgia appeared to be improving on thursday after a swiss-brokered deal resulted in a plan to reopen a mountain pass on the border .
all border crossings and flights between the two nations have been closed since the august war fought in 2008 .
" according to our preliminary verbal agreement with the russian side , the verkhny lars checkpoint will open in early march , " georgian deputy foreign minister nino kalandadze told a news conference .
georgia and russia fought a brief war last year over the georgian breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
opening up the border would be the first sign of thaw in diplomatic ties between russia and georgia which were severed after the war .
the russian border service also released a statement citing the " shared need to resume international traffic between georgia and russia . "
all is not forgiven moscow has repeatedly asserted , however , that it would not resume official relations with georgia as long as president mikheil saakashvili remains in power .
kalandadze said the agreement would allow georgian citizens and cargo to cross the border and that a formal protocol on reopening the crossing would be finalized within two weeks .
on tuesday , georgian airlines airzena asked the russian government to allow it to run charter flights between tbilisi and moscow during the winter holiday period .
approximately one million georgians live in russia .
" we assess the resumption of air links positively .
we hope that negotiations between private air companies on resumption of flights will result in a positive decision , " kalandadze said. sjt / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however he defended the little progress that was made at the meeting of representatives from over 190 countries .
" i think that people are justified in being disappointed about the outcome in copenhagen , " obama told pbs television wednesday after the summit ended with only vague prescriptions to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
" the science says that we 've got to significantly reduce emissions over the next 40 years .
there 's nothing in the copenhagen agreement that ensures that that happens , " he acknowledged .
but obama added : " what i said was essentially that rather than see a complete collapse in copenhagen ... at least we kind of held ground and there was n't too much backsliding from where we were . "
the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel said observers should refrain from " bad mouthing " the summit outcome but it prompted criticism for not setting tough , legally binding limits on future carbon emissions for the 193 nations present .
finger pointing earlier this week the european union sought to shift much of the blame for the outcome of the summit on the us and china , the world 's two largest emitters of carbon dioxide which most scientists believe is a leading cause of anthropogenic climate change .
sweden , which currently holds the eu presidency , described the copenhagen agreement as a disaster for the environment , while german chancellor angela merkel was slightly more upbeat , commenting that the accord was something that " now needed to be built upon . "
in the aftermath of the conference developed and developing nations have traded blows over who was to blame for the weak deal that was reached .
britain accused china of hijacking the proceedings , while brazil attacked the perceived lack of commitment shown by washington .
in turn , india harangued australia for being an " ayatollah of the single track , " and small island nations like tuvalu accused rich nations of blatant disregard for their plight. dfm / afp / reuters editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the logic of the move has been questioned , but the fans are just happy to see their hero back . the appointment of michael schumacher is making waves – with some claiming that carmaker mercedes has got its business priorities wrong .
german racing fans , on the other hand , appear to be delighted and schumacher will be happy to know that – after three years in retirement – he even has the full support of his wife .
mercedes secured the services of the 40-year-old german on wednesday , in a one-year deal .
the seven time drivers ' champion is to earn around seven million euros -lrb- $ 10 million -rrb- .
the move drew criticism from the mercedes labor representatives in light of recession cost-cutting measures by brand owner daimler .
" it 's hard to put across to people , " the chairman of mercedes ' bremen works council , uwe werner , told the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions have expressed criticism about the timing of the move " the daimler board decrees , on the one hand , harsh austerity measures for the workforce , and has shifted some production to facilities in other countries .
on the other hand it spends tens of millions on formula one .
it is incomprehensible to many workers . "
werner added that the company 's cost cutting measures would have received more support if mercedes had pulled out of formula one altogether .
deal " will sell cars " the head of mercedes motor sports , norbert haug , disagrees .
he said that the company would make money as a result of formula one and , in particular , signing the star driver .
" the whole issue will sell many cars and the caliber of the star will make a lot of people sit up and pay attention , " said haug .
the investment will not pay off for the company according to ferdinand dudenhoeffer , an economics professor at the university of duisburg-essen who specializes in the car industry .
he questions whether customers will buy a mercedes based on the fact that the brand had a formula one presence .
" you can hardly comprehend it . they will have to charge about 200 to 300 euros more for every car sold , to finance the formula one campaign for mercedes .
mercedes is a company for which sportiness is not the main selling point , it is instead based on safety and on quality on the road . "
rush on race tickets despite this , many german fans are euphoric at the news – with a rush on tickets for the race at hockenheim next july .
formula one supremo bernie ecclestone hailed the news as " fantastic " and predicted a " jaw-dropping season . "
" i think it is fantastic for formula one that he turned into a comeback kid but at the same time i also think it 's good for michael , " said ecclestone .
" when drivers have put in many years they sometimes lose focus and motivation – probably that was one of the reasons for his retirement in 2006 – but now he has again put all his strength together and has a 100 percent motivation level and that will give us many exciting races in 2010 .
forget about winning races – i have him on my bill for winning the championship . "

he said he has " no doubt " about his skills behind the wheel .
" i never stopped my physical training , " he said .
support from home schumacher can count on the full support of his wife of 14 years corinna .
" he knows exactly what he is doing and he knows that i am always behind him , " she said .

the logic of the move has been questioned , but the fans are just happy to see their hero back . the appointment of michael schumacher is making waves – with some claiming that carmaker mercedes has got its business priorities wrong .
german racing fans , on the other hand , appear to be delighted and schumacher will be happy to know that – after three years in retirement – he even has the full support of his wife .
mercedes secured the services of the 40-year-old german on wednesday , in a one-year deal .
the seven time drivers ' champion is to earn around seven million euros -lrb- $ 10 million -rrb- .
the move drew criticism from the mercedes labor representatives in light of recession cost-cutting measures by brand owner daimler .
" it 's hard to put across to people , " the chairman of mercedes ' bremen works council , uwe werner , told the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions have expressed criticism about the timing of the move " the daimler board decrees , on the one hand , harsh austerity measures for the workforce , and has shifted some production to facilities in other countries .
on the other hand it spends tens of millions on formula one .
it is incomprehensible to many workers . "
werner added that the company 's cost cutting measures would have received more support if mercedes had pulled out of formula one altogether .
deal " will sell cars " the head of mercedes motor sports , norbert haug , disagrees .
he said that the company would make money as a result of formula one and , in particular , signing the star driver .
" the whole issue will sell many cars and the caliber of the star will make a lot of people sit up and pay attention , " said haug .
the investment will not pay off for the company according to ferdinand dudenhoeffer , an economics professor at the university of duisburg-essen who specializes in the car industry .
he questions whether customers will buy a mercedes based on the fact that the brand had a formula one presence .
" you can hardly comprehend it . they will have to charge about 200 to 300 euros more for every car sold , to finance the formula one campaign for mercedes .
mercedes is a company for which sportiness is not the main selling point , it is instead based on safety and on quality on the road . "
rush on race tickets despite this , many german fans are euphoric at the news – with a rush on tickets for the race at hockenheim next july .
formula one supremo bernie ecclestone hailed the news as " fantastic " and predicted a " jaw-dropping season . "
" i think it is fantastic for formula one that he turned into a comeback kid but at the same time i also think it 's good for michael , " said ecclestone .
" when drivers have put in many years they sometimes lose focus and motivation – probably that was one of the reasons for his retirement in 2006 – but now he has again put all his strength together and has a 100 percent motivation level and that will give us many exciting races in 2010 .
forget about winning races – i have him on my bill for winning the championship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher was formula one world champion seven times and schumacher himself said he was confident of his abilities .
" obviously our only goal can be to fight for the world championship , " he told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
he said he has " no doubt " about his skills behind the wheel .
" i never stopped my physical training , " he said .
support from home schumacher can count on the full support of his wife of 14 years corinna .
" he knows exactly what he is doing and he knows that i am always behind him , " she said .
" he needs his challenges ; that 's just michael .
i understand it and i think it 's really great . "
she acknowledged that family life would be turned upside down , but said that when her husband told her of the call he had from his former and new team boss ross brawn " i immediately sensed that there was this fire burning inside him that i know so well . " schumacher had already tried to re-enter the sport this year , standing in for injured brazilian felipe massa for his former employer , ferrari .
but a motorcycle neck injury , from which schumacher says he has recovered , cut short any comeback attempt. rc / sid / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 24.12.2009 christmas : not such a holy night under the nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi propaganda extended to christmas cards and other traditions an exhibition in cologne shows how nazis appropriated christmas symbols to promote their ideology .
images of the holy family , stars and religious songs were manipulated to take the " christ " out of christmas . christmas is a high point in the religious calendar for germans .
many of the traditions , images and songs enjoyed around the world have their roots in the christmas celebrations of german speaking countries .
sparkling stars on the tree , a fair-haired and angelic baby , brightly-wrapped presents and joyful carols sung by church choirs are all parts of the celebrations on dec .
24 , the day marking the birth of jesus christ . between 1933 and 1945 , under the third reich , christmas was just as popular as it is today .
but honoring the birth of a jewish baby - who was celebrated as the christian savior - was difficult for nazis to embrace .
as a result , national socialist ideologues decided to remove christian symbolism from the celebration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis aimed to take the jewish baby , jesus , out of christmas " celebrating the birth of a jewish baby was unthinkable for the nazis , " said juergen mueller , the chief researcher behind the exhibit " not such a holy night " at the national socialism documentation center in cologne , which documents christmas tradition during the third reich . but christmas was too popular even during the nazi period to be banned , mueller told deutsche welle . " they therefore decided to corrupt it . " initially nazi officials had tried to reject all christian traditions .
they renamed the festival julfest and propagated the germanic origins of the winter celebration of light on december 21 , the winter solstice . but for the majority of germans , the christian traditions were still the basis of the holiday . mueller said nazi officials then took inspiration from classical images showing a baby jesus with his loving parents , mary and joseph .
they reinterpreted this as a model aryan family , an image which the nazis had elevated to the highest levels during the late 1930s .
so for the nazis , the family rather than jesus became the center of the christmas celebrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the nazis , grenade- shaped ornaments replaced stars churches in germany , although outraged by the nazis ' fervent efforts to undermine beliefs central to christianity , were powerless to protest what was happening . " the reaction of the church was not very strong .
at about 1936-1937 , the nazi government was so powerful that the possibility of protest was extremely low , " mueller said .
" the church could n't really condemn it or protest against it , although it stuck to the christian traditions within itself , " he added . nazi christmas tree decorations no aspect of the christmas celebrations was free of nazi symbolism .
the tree , which has long been a central component of german christmas festivities , was stripped of its traditional decorations .
stars , angels , bells , fruit and candy were replaced with swastikas and ornaments shaped like miniature cannons , grenades and fighter planes .
at the top of the tree , instead of a star or angel , firm adherents to the nazi doctrine placed a soaring golden eagle , the german national symbol .
parents wrapped their children 's presents in brightly colored paper with nazi symbols . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandizing christmas in germany dates back to wwi the most difficult of images for the nazis to undermine was the star .
a six-pointed christmas star was too similar to the yellow star the jews were required to wear ; and a five-pointed star resembled the red star of the soviets .
as a result , the nazis banned stars completely from christmas tree decorations .
geometric shapes embossed with swastikas or germanic symbols were used instead . popular christmas carols were also rendered christianity-free by nazi composers .
barbara kirschbaum , one of the staff members at the ns documentation center , told deutsche welle : " the nazis tried to ban some of the christmas carols with open christian content . " " some of the songs got new lyrics , some were completely recreated , " she said . " hohe nacht der klaren sterne " -lrb- " high night of bright stars " -rrb- is one of the songs newly created by the nazis .
one transformed song , " es ist fuer uns eine zeit angekommen " -lrb- " the time has come for us " -rrb- , is still popular in the nazi version .
people sing it even in churches , not being aware of the history of the lyrics , " kirschbaum said . public reaction for kirschbaum , the purpose of the exhibition is to discover what can be learned from the way the nazis manipulated christmas imagery .
she said people need to understand that history is shaped by people , and that propaganda is used to rewrite history .
when the visitors see this in the exhibit , it will increase their awareness of what happened under the nazis , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas wreath redone in nazi style " older visitors at first are usually touched by their childhood memories , which are reawakened by the objects .
but slowly they see the purpose behind the things , something they often did n't realize when they were young .
and this frightens them , to see how things were used and how their beliefs as children were used for propaganda purposes , " said kirschbaum . angelika wasserburger , a 51-year-old visitor to the exhibition from nuremberg , found the reality very uncomfortable . " i think it 's very frightening to realize how many of our traditions , how many of our symbols , have this origin which we do n't realize anymore .
and it 's very frightening also to realize the misuse that has been implemented with those symbols and traditions , " she told deutsche welle . the reaction of younger visitors to the exhibition is even stronger . jonas rahimi , a 15-year-old who came to the exhibition on a school trip , was shocked by how deeply nazism left its imprint on christmas celebrations in germany . " the nazis really involved their radical views in every part of life .
there was even a little war game for kids .
it 's very shocking to me , " he said . " i think it 's very important that the people here in cologne remember what happened here because it was very crucial and you should not forget it , " he added . author : faith thomas editor : kristin zeier / jen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes after much international criticism over the bill . in its current form , the bill proposes life imprisonment and even the death penalty for gays and lesbians in uganda .
museveni 's top aide said on thursday that the president was planning to intervene to address the concerns of uganda 's western partners who have expressed strong opposition to the bill .
" we should not have an extreme position .
the president will harmonize the two sides and address the concerns of the europeans and our other development partners . " said museveni 's spokesman .
international condemnation the bill , which is yet to be debated in uganda 's parliament , would have gay men and lesbians sentenced to life in prison for having sex .
in cases of sex with minors or sexual acts leading to hiv infection , the penalty would be death .
the bill also proposes that anyone who fails to report a homosexual act committed by others would face up to three years in jail .
international reaction to the bill has been widespread condemnation , with some western states threatening to withdraw aid to uganda if the government passes the bill into law .
there has also been outcry from the country 's small gay and lesbian community .

uganda denies bowing to the west uganda 's ethics and integrity minister nsaba buturo said the revised law would most likely make life in prison the maximum penalty for offenders .

however he defended the little progress that was made at the meeting of representatives from over 190 countries .
" i think that people are justified in being disappointed about the outcome in copenhagen , " obama told pbs television wednesday after the summit ended with only vague prescriptions to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
" the science says that we 've got to significantly reduce emissions over the next 40 years .
there 's nothing in the copenhagen agreement that ensures that that happens , " he acknowledged .
but obama added : " what i said was essentially that rather than see a complete collapse in copenhagen ... at least we kind of held ground and there was n't too much backsliding from where we were . "
the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel said observers should refrain from " bad mouthing " the summit outcome but it prompted criticism for not setting tough , legally binding limits on future carbon emissions for the 193 nations present .
finger pointing earlier this week the european union sought to shift much of the blame for the outcome of the summit on the us and china , the world 's two largest emitters of carbon dioxide which most scientists believe is a leading cause of anthropogenic climate change .
sweden , which currently holds the eu presidency , described the copenhagen agreement as a disaster for the environment , while german chancellor angela merkel was slightly more upbeat , commenting that the accord was something that " now needed to be built upon . "
in the aftermath of the conference developed and developing nations have traded blows over who was to blame for the weak deal that was reached .
britain accused china of hijacking the proceedings , while brazil attacked the perceived lack of commitment shown by washington .
in turn , india harangued australia for being an " ayatollah of the single track , " and small island nations like tuvalu accused rich nations of blatant disregard for their plight. dfm / afp / reuters editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for over 20 years , postal workers have written back . it 's a tradition for young children around the world to send letters to santa claus with their wishes for christmas .
german children , however , practice a slightly different tradition .
they often send letters to the christkind , who is responsible for bringing the presents on christmas .
the christkind is a symbolic representation of the christmas spirit that is often depicted as a christmas angel .
many of those letters land in a small town in western germany called engelskirchen .
translated , the town 's name means " angels ' church " - a fitting name for the seasonal home of a christmas post office .
the post office , located on the town 's aptly named " angels ' square , " is one of six official addresses in germany for letters addressed to the christkind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans picture the christkind as a kind of fairy , or angel the tradition started in 1985 , when other post offices around germany were n't sure what to do with letters addressed to the christkind .
" since engelskirchen was such a nice name , they ended up just sending them there , " said britta toellner , a spokeswoman for germany 's mail carrier deutsche post .
" and at the time , there was a manager here who opened the letters and saw that they were christmas lists , so just for fun , she answered a few . "
the christkind 's new home before long , a few turned into many , as mountains of letters started arriving in engelskirchen .
the postal workers started taking letters home with them to write responses to children hoping to hear from the christkind .

" for example , kids will ask ' can you say hello to my mother ?
she 's in heaven and lives with you there . '
those letters are tough to take , " said toeller .
" increasingly , they are also thinking of the bigger picture .
we used to see lots of messages for peace on earth and goodwill toward people , which they often simply picked up somewhere , but now kids are noticing that something is not quite right with the environment .

this comes after much international criticism over the bill . in its current form , the bill proposes life imprisonment and even the death penalty for gays and lesbians in uganda .
museveni 's top aide said on thursday that the president was planning to intervene to address the concerns of uganda 's western partners who have expressed strong opposition to the bill .
" we should not have an extreme position .
the president will harmonize the two sides and address the concerns of the europeans and our other development partners . " said museveni 's spokesman .
international condemnation the bill , which is yet to be debated in uganda 's parliament , would have gay men and lesbians sentenced to life in prison for having sex .
in cases of sex with minors or sexual acts leading to hiv infection , the penalty would be death .
the bill also proposes that anyone who fails to report a homosexual act committed by others would face up to three years in jail .
international reaction to the bill has been widespread condemnation , with some western states threatening to withdraw aid to uganda if the government passes the bill into law .
there has also been outcry from the country 's small gay and lesbian community .

a top anglican cleric of ugandan decent in the uk , archbishop of york john sentamu , said he was " totally opposed to the death sentence " and found the language being used to describe homosexuals " upsetting " .
uganda denies bowing to the west uganda 's ethics and integrity minister nsaba buturo said the revised law would most likely make life in prison the maximum penalty for offenders .
" there have been a lot of discussions in government regarding the proposed law , but we now think a life sentence could be better because it gives room for offenders to be rehabilitated , " he said .

this comes after much international criticism over the bill . in its current form , the bill proposes life imprisonment and even the death penalty for gays and lesbians in uganda .
museveni 's top aide said on thursday that the president was planning to intervene to address the concerns of uganda 's western partners who have expressed strong opposition to the bill .
" we should not have an extreme position .
the president will harmonize the two sides and address the concerns of the europeans and our other development partners . " said museveni 's spokesman .
international condemnation the bill , which is yet to be debated in uganda 's parliament , would have gay men and lesbians sentenced to life in prison for having sex .
in cases of sex with minors or sexual acts leading to hiv infection , the penalty would be death .
the bill also proposes that anyone who fails to report a homosexual act committed by others would face up to three years in jail .
international reaction to the bill has been widespread condemnation , with some western states threatening to withdraw aid to uganda if the government passes the bill into law .
there has also been outcry from the country 's small gay and lesbian community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : church groups worldwide have condemned the bill the world council of churches -lrb- wcc -rrb- has also criticized the bill , saying it would run against basic christian teaching by promoting hatred .
" from the experience of many nations , it is very clear that if such a bill is enacted into law , it will leave a lot of room for manipulation , abuse , blackmail and oppression of people " said wcc chief samuel kobia .
a top anglican cleric of ugandan decent in the uk , archbishop of york john sentamu , said he was " totally opposed to the death sentence " and found the language being used to describe homosexuals " upsetting " .
uganda denies bowing to the west uganda 's ethics and integrity minister nsaba buturo said the revised law would most likely make life in prison the maximum penalty for offenders .
" there have been a lot of discussions in government regarding the proposed law , but we now think a life sentence could be better because it gives room for offenders to be rehabilitated , " he said .
" killing them might not be helpful , " he added .

this comes after much international criticism over the bill . in its current form , the bill proposes life imprisonment and even the death penalty for gays and lesbians in uganda .
museveni 's top aide said on thursday that the president was planning to intervene to address the concerns of uganda 's western partners who have expressed strong opposition to the bill .
" we should not have an extreme position .
the president will harmonize the two sides and address the concerns of the europeans and our other development partners . " said museveni 's spokesman .
international condemnation the bill , which is yet to be debated in uganda 's parliament , would have gay men and lesbians sentenced to life in prison for having sex .
in cases of sex with minors or sexual acts leading to hiv infection , the penalty would be death .
the bill also proposes that anyone who fails to report a homosexual act committed by others would face up to three years in jail .
international reaction to the bill has been widespread condemnation , with some western states threatening to withdraw aid to uganda if the government passes the bill into law .
there has also been outcry from the country 's small gay and lesbian community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : church groups worldwide have condemned the bill the world council of churches -lrb- wcc -rrb- has also criticized the bill , saying it would run against basic christian teaching by promoting hatred .
" from the experience of many nations , it is very clear that if such a bill is enacted into law , it will leave a lot of room for manipulation , abuse , blackmail and oppression of people " said wcc chief samuel kobia .
a top anglican cleric of ugandan decent in the uk , archbishop of york john sentamu , said he was " totally opposed to the death sentence " and found the language being used to describe homosexuals " upsetting " .
uganda denies bowing to the west uganda 's ethics and integrity minister nsaba buturo said the revised law would most likely make life in prison the maximum penalty for offenders .
" there have been a lot of discussions in government regarding the proposed law , but we now think a life sentence could be better because it gives room for offenders to be rehabilitated , " he said .
" killing them might not be helpful , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east-african state has benefitted from western aid and investment however , buturo denied the change in government attitude was forced by western pressure .
" it 's really out of our consultation with various groups , including religious leaders .
it has nothing to do with external forces , " he said .
buturo also added that uganda had not changed its view that homosexuality is a " moral perversion that must not be allowed to spread " .
uganda has long benefitted from western aid and investment due to its stable economy and widespread economic reforms. mk / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

georgian-russian relations have been strained since a short war fought last year . ties between russia and georgia appeared to be improving on thursday after a swiss-brokered deal resulted in a plan to reopen a mountain pass on the border .
all border crossings and flights between the two nations have been closed since the august war fought in 2008 .
" according to our preliminary verbal agreement with the russian side , the verkhny lars checkpoint will open in early march , " georgian deputy foreign minister nino kalandadze told a news conference .
georgia and russia fought a brief war last year over the georgian breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
opening up the border would be the first sign of thaw in diplomatic ties between russia and georgia which were severed after the war .
the russian border service also released a statement citing the " shared need to resume international traffic between georgia and russia . "
all is not forgiven moscow has repeatedly asserted , however , that it would not resume official relations with georgia as long as president mikheil saakashvili remains in power .
kalandadze said the agreement would allow georgian citizens and cargo to cross the border and that a formal protocol on reopening the crossing would be finalized within two weeks .
on tuesday , georgian airlines airzena asked the russian government to allow it to run charter flights between tbilisi and moscow during the winter holiday period .
approximately one million georgians live in russia .
" we assess the resumption of air links positively .
we hope that negotiations between private air companies on resumption of flights will result in a positive decision , " kalandadze said. sjt / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however he defended the little progress that was made at the meeting of representatives from over 190 countries .
" i think that people are justified in being disappointed about the outcome in copenhagen , " obama told pbs television wednesday after the summit ended with only vague prescriptions to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
" the science says that we 've got to significantly reduce emissions over the next 40 years .
there 's nothing in the copenhagen agreement that ensures that that happens , " he acknowledged .
but obama added : " what i said was essentially that rather than see a complete collapse in copenhagen ... at least we kind of held ground and there was n't too much backsliding from where we were . "
the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel said observers should refrain from " bad mouthing " the summit outcome but it prompted criticism for not setting tough , legally binding limits on future carbon emissions for the 193 nations present .
finger pointing earlier this week the european union sought to shift much of the blame for the outcome of the summit on the us and china , the world 's two largest emitters of carbon dioxide which most scientists believe is a leading cause of anthropogenic climate change .
sweden , which currently holds the eu presidency , described the copenhagen agreement as a disaster for the environment , while german chancellor angela merkel was slightly more upbeat , commenting that the accord was something that " now needed to be built upon . "
in the aftermath of the conference developed and developing nations have traded blows over who was to blame for the weak deal that was reached .
britain accused china of hijacking the proceedings , while brazil attacked the perceived lack of commitment shown by washington .
in turn , india harangued australia for being an " ayatollah of the single track , " and small island nations like tuvalu accused rich nations of blatant disregard for their plight. dfm / afp / reuters editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 24.12.2009 christmas : not such a holy night under the nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi propaganda extended to christmas cards and other traditions an exhibition in cologne shows how nazis appropriated christmas symbols to promote their ideology .
images of the holy family , stars and religious songs were manipulated to take the " christ " out of christmas . christmas is a high point in the religious calendar for germans .
many of the traditions , images and songs enjoyed around the world have their roots in the christmas celebrations of german speaking countries .
sparkling stars on the tree , a fair-haired and angelic baby , brightly-wrapped presents and joyful carols sung by church choirs are all parts of the celebrations on dec .
24 , the day marking the birth of jesus christ . between 1933 and 1945 , under the third reich , christmas was just as popular as it is today .
but honoring the birth of a jewish baby - who was celebrated as the christian savior - was difficult for nazis to embrace .
as a result , national socialist ideologues decided to remove christian symbolism from the celebration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis aimed to take the jewish baby , jesus , out of christmas " celebrating the birth of a jewish baby was unthinkable for the nazis , " said juergen mueller , the chief researcher behind the exhibit " not such a holy night " at the national socialism documentation center in cologne , which documents christmas tradition during the third reich . but christmas was too popular even during the nazi period to be banned , mueller told deutsche welle . " they therefore decided to corrupt it . " initially nazi officials had tried to reject all christian traditions .
they renamed the festival julfest and propagated the germanic origins of the winter celebration of light on december 21 , the winter solstice . but for the majority of germans , the christian traditions were still the basis of the holiday . mueller said nazi officials then took inspiration from classical images showing a baby jesus with his loving parents , mary and joseph .
they reinterpreted this as a model aryan family , an image which the nazis had elevated to the highest levels during the late 1930s .
so for the nazis , the family rather than jesus became the center of the christmas celebrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the nazis , grenade- shaped ornaments replaced stars churches in germany , although outraged by the nazis ' fervent efforts to undermine beliefs central to christianity , were powerless to protest what was happening . " the reaction of the church was not very strong .
at about 1936-1937 , the nazi government was so powerful that the possibility of protest was extremely low , " mueller said .
" the church could n't really condemn it or protest against it , although it stuck to the christian traditions within itself , " he added . nazi christmas tree decorations no aspect of the christmas celebrations was free of nazi symbolism .
the tree , which has long been a central component of german christmas festivities , was stripped of its traditional decorations .
stars , angels , bells , fruit and candy were replaced with swastikas and ornaments shaped like miniature cannons , grenades and fighter planes .
at the top of the tree , instead of a star or angel , firm adherents to the nazi doctrine placed a soaring golden eagle , the german national symbol .
parents wrapped their children 's presents in brightly colored paper with nazi symbols . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandizing christmas in germany dates back to wwi the most difficult of images for the nazis to undermine was the star .
a six-pointed christmas star was too similar to the yellow star the jews were required to wear ; and a five-pointed star resembled the red star of the soviets .
as a result , the nazis banned stars completely from christmas tree decorations .
geometric shapes embossed with swastikas or germanic symbols were used instead . popular christmas carols were also rendered christianity-free by nazi composers .
barbara kirschbaum , one of the staff members at the ns documentation center , told deutsche welle : " the nazis tried to ban some of the christmas carols with open christian content . " " some of the songs got new lyrics , some were completely recreated , " she said . " hohe nacht der klaren sterne " -lrb- " high night of bright stars " -rrb- is one of the songs newly created by the nazis .
one transformed song , " es ist fuer uns eine zeit angekommen " -lrb- " the time has come for us " -rrb- , is still popular in the nazi version .
people sing it even in churches , not being aware of the history of the lyrics , " kirschbaum said . public reaction for kirschbaum , the purpose of the exhibition is to discover what can be learned from the way the nazis manipulated christmas imagery .
she said people need to understand that history is shaped by people , and that propaganda is used to rewrite history .
when the visitors see this in the exhibit , it will increase their awareness of what happened under the nazis , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas wreath redone in nazi style " older visitors at first are usually touched by their childhood memories , which are reawakened by the objects .
but slowly they see the purpose behind the things , something they often did n't realize when they were young .
and this frightens them , to see how things were used and how their beliefs as children were used for propaganda purposes , " said kirschbaum . angelika wasserburger , a 51-year-old visitor to the exhibition from nuremberg , found the reality very uncomfortable . " i think it 's very frightening to realize how many of our traditions , how many of our symbols , have this origin which we do n't realize anymore .
and it 's very frightening also to realize the misuse that has been implemented with those symbols and traditions , " she told deutsche welle . the reaction of younger visitors to the exhibition is even stronger . jonas rahimi , a 15-year-old who came to the exhibition on a school trip , was shocked by how deeply nazism left its imprint on christmas celebrations in germany . " the nazis really involved their radical views in every part of life .
there was even a little war game for kids .
it 's very shocking to me , " he said . " i think it 's very important that the people here in cologne remember what happened here because it was very crucial and you should not forget it , " he added . author : faith thomas editor : kristin zeier / jen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tree , which has long been a central component of german christmas festivities , was stripped of its traditional decorations .

images of the holy family , stars and religious songs were manipulated to take the " christ " out of christmas . christmas is a high point in the religious calendar for germans .
many of the traditions , images and songs enjoyed around the world have their roots in the christmas celebrations of german speaking countries .
sparkling stars on the tree , a fair-haired and angelic baby , brightly-wrapped presents and joyful carols sung by church choirs are all parts of the celebrations on dec .
24 , the day marking the birth of jesus christ . between 1933 and 1945 , under the third reich , christmas was just as popular as it is today .
but honoring the birth of a jewish baby - who was celebrated as the christian savior - was difficult for nazis to embrace .
as a result , national socialist ideologues decided to remove christian symbolism from the celebration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis aimed to take the jewish baby , jesus , out of christmas " celebrating the birth of a jewish baby was unthinkable for the nazis , " said juergen mueller , the chief researcher behind the exhibit " not such a holy night " at the national socialism documentation center in cologne , which documents christmas tradition during the third reich . but christmas was too popular even during the nazi period to be banned , mueller told deutsche welle . " they therefore decided to corrupt it . " initially nazi officials had tried to reject all christian traditions .
they renamed the festival julfest and propagated the germanic origins of the winter celebration of light on december 21 , the winter solstice . but for the majority of germans , the christian traditions were still the basis of the holiday . mueller said nazi officials then took inspiration from classical images showing a baby jesus with his loving parents , mary and joseph .
they reinterpreted this as a model aryan family , an image which the nazis had elevated to the highest levels during the late 1930s .
so for the nazis , the family rather than jesus became the center of the christmas celebrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the nazis , grenade- shaped ornaments replaced stars churches in germany , although outraged by the nazis ' fervent efforts to undermine beliefs central to christianity , were powerless to protest what was happening . " the reaction of the church was not very strong .

images of the holy family , stars and religious songs were manipulated to take the " christ " out of christmas . christmas is a high point in the religious calendar for germans .
many of the traditions , images and songs enjoyed around the world have their roots in the christmas celebrations of german speaking countries .
sparkling stars on the tree , a fair-haired and angelic baby , brightly-wrapped presents and joyful carols sung by church choirs are all parts of the celebrations on dec .
24 , the day marking the birth of jesus christ . between 1933 and 1945 , under the third reich , christmas was just as popular as it is today .
but honoring the birth of a jewish baby - who was celebrated as the christian savior - was difficult for nazis to embrace .
as a result , national socialist ideologues decided to remove christian symbolism from the celebration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis aimed to take the jewish baby , jesus , out of christmas " celebrating the birth of a jewish baby was unthinkable for the nazis , " said juergen mueller , the chief researcher behind the exhibit " not such a holy night " at the national socialism documentation center in cologne , which documents christmas tradition during the third reich . but christmas was too popular even during the nazi period to be banned , mueller told deutsche welle . " they therefore decided to corrupt it . " initially nazi officials had tried to reject all christian traditions .
they renamed the festival julfest and propagated the germanic origins of the winter celebration of light on december 21 , the winter solstice . but for the majority of germans , the christian traditions were still the basis of the holiday . mueller said nazi officials then took inspiration from classical images showing a baby jesus with his loving parents , mary and joseph .
they reinterpreted this as a model aryan family , an image which the nazis had elevated to the highest levels during the late 1930s .
so for the nazis , the family rather than jesus became the center of the christmas celebrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the nazis , grenade- shaped ornaments replaced stars churches in germany , although outraged by the nazis ' fervent efforts to undermine beliefs central to christianity , were powerless to protest what was happening . " the reaction of the church was not very strong .
at about 1936-1937 , the nazi government was so powerful that the possibility of protest was extremely low , " mueller said .
" the church could n't really condemn it or protest against it , although it stuck to the christian traditions within itself , " he added . nazi christmas tree decorations no aspect of the christmas celebrations was free of nazi symbolism .
the tree , which has long been a central component of german christmas festivities , was stripped of its traditional decorations .
stars , angels , bells , fruit and candy were replaced with swastikas and ornaments shaped like miniature cannons , grenades and fighter planes .
at the top of the tree , instead of a star or angel , firm adherents to the nazi doctrine placed a soaring golden eagle , the german national symbol .
parents wrapped their children 's presents in brightly colored paper with nazi symbols . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandizing christmas in germany dates back to wwi the most difficult of images for the nazis to undermine was the star .
a six-pointed christmas star was too similar to the yellow star the jews were required to wear ; and a five-pointed star resembled the red star of the soviets .
as a result , the nazis banned stars completely from christmas tree decorations .
geometric shapes embossed with swastikas or germanic symbols were used instead . popular christmas carols were also rendered christianity-free by nazi composers .
barbara kirschbaum , one of the staff members at the ns documentation center , told deutsche welle : " the nazis tried to ban some of the christmas carols with open christian content . " " some of the songs got new lyrics , some were completely recreated , " she said . " hohe nacht der klaren sterne " -lrb- " high night of bright stars " -rrb- is one of the songs newly created by the nazis .
one transformed song , " es ist fuer uns eine zeit angekommen " -lrb- " the time has come for us " -rrb- , is still popular in the nazi version .
people sing it even in churches , not being aware of the history of the lyrics , " kirschbaum said . public reaction for kirschbaum , the purpose of the exhibition is to discover what can be learned from the way the nazis manipulated christmas imagery .
she said people need to understand that history is shaped by people , and that propaganda is used to rewrite history .
when the visitors see this in the exhibit , it will increase their awareness of what happened under the nazis , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas wreath redone in nazi style " older visitors at first are usually touched by their childhood memories , which are reawakened by the objects .
but slowly they see the purpose behind the things , something they often did n't realize when they were young .
and this frightens them , to see how things were used and how their beliefs as children were used for propaganda purposes , " said kirschbaum . angelika wasserburger , a 51-year-old visitor to the exhibition from nuremberg , found the reality very uncomfortable . " i think it 's very frightening to realize how many of our traditions , how many of our symbols , have this origin which we do n't realize anymore .
and it 's very frightening also to realize the misuse that has been implemented with those symbols and traditions , " she told deutsche welle . the reaction of younger visitors to the exhibition is even stronger . jonas rahimi , a 15-year-old who came to the exhibition on a school trip , was shocked by how deeply nazism left its imprint on christmas celebrations in germany . " the nazis really involved their radical views in every part of life .
there was even a little war game for kids .

however he defended the little progress that was made at the meeting of representatives from over 190 countries .
" i think that people are justified in being disappointed about the outcome in copenhagen , " obama told pbs television wednesday after the summit ended with only vague prescriptions to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
" the science says that we 've got to significantly reduce emissions over the next 40 years .
there 's nothing in the copenhagen agreement that ensures that that happens , " he acknowledged .
but obama added : " what i said was essentially that rather than see a complete collapse in copenhagen ... at least we kind of held ground and there was n't too much backsliding from where we were . "
the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel said observers should refrain from " bad mouthing " the summit outcome but it prompted criticism for not setting tough , legally binding limits on future carbon emissions for the 193 nations present .
finger pointing earlier this week the european union sought to shift much of the blame for the outcome of the summit on the us and china , the world 's two largest emitters of carbon dioxide which most scientists believe is a leading cause of anthropogenic climate change .
sweden , which currently holds the eu presidency , described the copenhagen agreement as a disaster for the environment , while german chancellor angela merkel was slightly more upbeat , commenting that the accord was something that " now needed to be built upon . "
in the aftermath of the conference developed and developing nations have traded blows over who was to blame for the weak deal that was reached .
britain accused china of hijacking the proceedings , while brazil attacked the perceived lack of commitment shown by washington .
in turn , india harangued australia for being an " ayatollah of the single track , " and small island nations like tuvalu accused rich nations of blatant disregard for their plight. dfm / afp / reuters editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to some accounts from kurdish sources , the number arrested was between 60 and 80 .

the pkk is a separatist militant group , which is regarded by the european union as a terrorist organization .
among those held in diyarbakir was a lawyer for the jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan .
raids across country the raids took place in cities across the southeast of the country as well as in istanbul and the capital , ankara .
the ban on the dtp , which led to days of unrest in kurdish areas of turkey , was opposed by prime minister tayyip erdogan .
erdogan had been trying to resolve a conflict that has cost around 40,000 lives over the past 25 years .
kurds make up about 20 percent of turkey 's 71 million population , and were forbidden from using their language for decades . following the raids , around 1,000 people gathered outside the diyarbakir office of the peace and democratic party -lrb- bdp -rrb- , which also represents kurds .
warning to government city mayor osman baydemir spoke to the crowd and warned the national government that , if the detentions continued , it would have no-one to negotiate with .
" if this process of purges continues , i state it very obviously : a day will come when you will find no-one to shake hands with , " said baydemir .
the european commission has condemned the banning of the dtp , while also criticizing the party for retaining links with the pkk .
turkey is involved in negotiations to join the european union but has been criticized for its human rights record .
legislators from the dtp announced last friday that they would join the bdp to stay in parliament. rc / ape / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the logic of the move has been questioned , but the fans are just happy to see their hero back . the appointment of michael schumacher is making waves – with some claiming that carmaker mercedes has got its business priorities wrong .
german racing fans , on the other hand , appear to be delighted and schumacher will be happy to know that – after three years in retirement – he even has the full support of his wife .
mercedes secured the services of the 40-year-old german on wednesday , in a one-year deal .
the seven time drivers ' champion is to earn around seven million euros -lrb- $ 10 million -rrb- .
the move drew criticism from the mercedes labor representatives in light of recession cost-cutting measures by brand owner daimler .
" it 's hard to put across to people , " the chairman of mercedes ' bremen works council , uwe werner , told the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions have expressed criticism about the timing of the move " the daimler board decrees , on the one hand , harsh austerity measures for the workforce , and has shifted some production to facilities in other countries .

it is incomprehensible to many workers . "
werner added that the company 's cost cutting measures would have received more support if mercedes had pulled out of formula one altogether .
deal " will sell cars " the head of mercedes motor sports , norbert haug , disagrees .
he said that the company would make money as a result of formula one and , in particular , signing the star driver .
" the whole issue will sell many cars and the caliber of the star will make a lot of people sit up and pay attention , " said haug .
the investment will not pay off for the company according to ferdinand dudenhoeffer , an economics professor at the university of duisburg-essen who specializes in the car industry .
he questions whether customers will buy a mercedes based on the fact that the brand had a formula one presence .
" you can hardly comprehend it . they will have to charge about 200 to 300 euros more for every car sold , to finance the formula one campaign for mercedes .
mercedes is a company for which sportiness is not the main selling point , it is instead based on safety and on quality on the road . "
rush on race tickets despite this , many german fans are euphoric at the news – with a rush on tickets for the race at hockenheim next july .
formula one supremo bernie ecclestone hailed the news as " fantastic " and predicted a " jaw-dropping season . "
" i think it is fantastic for formula one that he turned into a comeback kid but at the same time i also think it 's good for michael , " said ecclestone .
" when drivers have put in many years they sometimes lose focus and motivation – probably that was one of the reasons for his retirement in 2006 – but now he has again put all his strength together and has a 100 percent motivation level and that will give us many exciting races in 2010 .
forget about winning races – i have him on my bill for winning the championship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher was formula one world champion seven times and schumacher himself said he was confident of his abilities .

" he needs his challenges ; that 's just michael .
i understand it and i think it 's really great . "

the logic of the move has been questioned , but the fans are just happy to see their hero back . the appointment of michael schumacher is making waves – with some claiming that carmaker mercedes has got its business priorities wrong .
german racing fans , on the other hand , appear to be delighted and schumacher will be happy to know that – after three years in retirement – he even has the full support of his wife .
mercedes secured the services of the 40-year-old german on wednesday , in a one-year deal .
the seven time drivers ' champion is to earn around seven million euros -lrb- $ 10 million -rrb- .
the move drew criticism from the mercedes labor representatives in light of recession cost-cutting measures by brand owner daimler .
" it 's hard to put across to people , " the chairman of mercedes ' bremen works council , uwe werner , told the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions have expressed criticism about the timing of the move " the daimler board decrees , on the one hand , harsh austerity measures for the workforce , and has shifted some production to facilities in other countries .
on the other hand it spends tens of millions on formula one .
it is incomprehensible to many workers . "
werner added that the company 's cost cutting measures would have received more support if mercedes had pulled out of formula one altogether .
deal " will sell cars " the head of mercedes motor sports , norbert haug , disagrees .
he said that the company would make money as a result of formula one and , in particular , signing the star driver .
" the whole issue will sell many cars and the caliber of the star will make a lot of people sit up and pay attention , " said haug .
the investment will not pay off for the company according to ferdinand dudenhoeffer , an economics professor at the university of duisburg-essen who specializes in the car industry .
he questions whether customers will buy a mercedes based on the fact that the brand had a formula one presence .
" you can hardly comprehend it . they will have to charge about 200 to 300 euros more for every car sold , to finance the formula one campaign for mercedes .
mercedes is a company for which sportiness is not the main selling point , it is instead based on safety and on quality on the road . "
rush on race tickets despite this , many german fans are euphoric at the news – with a rush on tickets for the race at hockenheim next july .
formula one supremo bernie ecclestone hailed the news as " fantastic " and predicted a " jaw-dropping season . "
" i think it is fantastic for formula one that he turned into a comeback kid but at the same time i also think it 's good for michael , " said ecclestone .
" when drivers have put in many years they sometimes lose focus and motivation – probably that was one of the reasons for his retirement in 2006 – but now he has again put all his strength together and has a 100 percent motivation level and that will give us many exciting races in 2010 .
forget about winning races – i have him on my bill for winning the championship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher was formula one world champion seven times and schumacher himself said he was confident of his abilities .
" obviously our only goal can be to fight for the world championship , " he told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
he said he has " no doubt " about his skills behind the wheel .
" i never stopped my physical training , " he said .
support from home schumacher can count on the full support of his wife of 14 years corinna .

i understand it and i think it 's really great . "

a new german study of organic and ethical fashion shows the growing industry is n't all it 's cracked up to be - especially when it comes to verifying adherence to " green " standards . recent years have seen a boom in the the organic , socially conscious textile industry .
small ethical t-shirt companies are shooting up left and right , and even big producers like hennes & mauritz have jumped on the bandwagon , making a line of organic cotton clothes .
in light of this , the german non-profit organization suedwind tested these companies to see if they delivered what they advertised - and to what extent .
questionnaires were sent out to 240 companies whose ecologically or socially conscious products can be ordered online in germany .
just 23 companies - 17 of them german - responded .
verification is an issue suedwind said the aim of the study was to see how closely the companies complied with generally accepted industry standards for ethical production , such as widespread international labor organization conventions and fair-trade labelling rules , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fairtrade is one of several groups out to verify compliance " many companies call themselves green , or ethical or fair , " said dominic kloos , who ran the suedwind study .
" but are they really ethical or ecological ?
that 's what we wanted to find out . "
kloos acknowledged that the low rate of response meant the study shows " tendencies " rather than giving a full picture of the industry .
but overall , despite progress , he said the results showed that " many … complied with some of the most important standards , but not with all of them . "
seven ' green ' criteria the suedwind study examined seven criteria , from checking ecological standards -lrb- are all components certified organic ? -rrb- and social ones -lrb- does the company comply with the " clean clothes campaign " code of conduct throughout its entire production chain ? -rrb- .
it also looked at verification measures , transparency levels , raw materials sourcing , and the chemical content of the clothes , among others .
" the main outcome is that ecological standards are easier to verify than social ones , " kloos said .
while environmental standards can be verified by certification agencies , social standards can only be upheld if a company is a member of a so-called multi-stakeholder initiative , or if they are a cooperative , " which means the work standards are in the workers ' hands , " kloos said .
overall , the study showed that 69 percent of the companies said they fulfilled basic social conventions , while 22 percent in accordance with listed ecological standards .
of those , 35 percent had external verification procedures for ecological standards - but only four of the 23 companies said they externally verified social standards .
raising the bar kloos acknowledged that his job is to " raise the bar very high " when shining a light on company behaviors .
but the fact that eco-clothing companies exist at all is a good sign for the future of the textile industry : " it 's great that these niche companies exist - they put pressure on the market , so that bigger companies , like h & m , come out with organic clothing , " he said .
ultimately , though , we do n't need to improve social and ecological standards on a voluntary basis , kloos said .
" what we need is legally binding rules . "

a new german study of organic and ethical fashion shows the growing industry is n't all it 's cracked up to be - especially when it comes to verifying adherence to " green " standards . recent years have seen a boom in the the organic , socially conscious textile industry .
small ethical t-shirt companies are shooting up left and right , and even big producers like hennes & mauritz have jumped on the bandwagon , making a line of organic cotton clothes .
in light of this , the german non-profit organization suedwind tested these companies to see if they delivered what they advertised - and to what extent .
questionnaires were sent out to 240 companies whose ecologically or socially conscious products can be ordered online in germany .
just 23 companies - 17 of them german - responded .
verification is an issue suedwind said the aim of the study was to see how closely the companies complied with generally accepted industry standards for ethical production , such as widespread international labor organization conventions and fair-trade labelling rules , among others .

kloos acknowledged that the low rate of response meant the study shows " tendencies " rather than giving a full picture of the industry .
but overall , despite progress , he said the results showed that " many … complied with some of the most important standards , but not with all of them . "
seven ' green ' criteria the suedwind study examined seven criteria , from checking ecological standards -lrb- are all components certified organic ? -rrb- and social ones -lrb- does the company comply with the " clean clothes campaign " code of conduct throughout its entire production chain ? -rrb- .

a new german study of organic and ethical fashion shows the growing industry is n't all it 's cracked up to be - especially when it comes to verifying adherence to " green " standards . recent years have seen a boom in the the organic , socially conscious textile industry .
small ethical t-shirt companies are shooting up left and right , and even big producers like hennes & mauritz have jumped on the bandwagon , making a line of organic cotton clothes .
in light of this , the german non-profit organization suedwind tested these companies to see if they delivered what they advertised - and to what extent .
questionnaires were sent out to 240 companies whose ecologically or socially conscious products can be ordered online in germany .
just 23 companies - 17 of them german - responded .
verification is an issue suedwind said the aim of the study was to see how closely the companies complied with generally accepted industry standards for ethical production , such as widespread international labor organization conventions and fair-trade labelling rules , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fairtrade is one of several groups out to verify compliance " many companies call themselves green , or ethical or fair , " said dominic kloos , who ran the suedwind study .
" but are they really ethical or ecological ?
that 's what we wanted to find out . "
kloos acknowledged that the low rate of response meant the study shows " tendencies " rather than giving a full picture of the industry .
but overall , despite progress , he said the results showed that " many … complied with some of the most important standards , but not with all of them . "
seven ' green ' criteria the suedwind study examined seven criteria , from checking ecological standards -lrb- are all components certified organic ? -rrb- and social ones -lrb- does the company comply with the " clean clothes campaign " code of conduct throughout its entire production chain ? -rrb- .
it also looked at verification measures , transparency levels , raw materials sourcing , and the chemical content of the clothes , among others .
" the main outcome is that ecological standards are easier to verify than social ones , " kloos said .
while environmental standards can be verified by certification agencies , social standards can only be upheld if a company is a member of a so-called multi-stakeholder initiative , or if they are a cooperative , " which means the work standards are in the workers ' hands , " kloos said .
overall , the study showed that 69 percent of the companies said they fulfilled basic social conventions , while 22 percent in accordance with listed ecological standards .
of those , 35 percent had external verification procedures for ecological standards - but only four of the 23 companies said they externally verified social standards .
raising the bar kloos acknowledged that his job is to " raise the bar very high " when shining a light on company behaviors .
but the fact that eco-clothing companies exist at all is a good sign for the future of the textile industry : " it 's great that these niche companies exist - they put pressure on the market , so that bigger companies , like h & m , come out with organic clothing , " he said .
ultimately , though , we do n't need to improve social and ecological standards on a voluntary basis , kloos said .
" what we need is legally binding rules . "

germany 's rail operator deutsche bahn announced on wednesday that only one out of two regularly scheduled trains would be running on the high speed ice route connecting berlin , leipzig and munich until after christmas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramsauer says delays are ' more than annoying ' the reason : excessive snow and ice have taken too many trains out of action .
trains ' not built for these temperatures ' " the trains are not built to withstand these siberian temperatures , " deutsche bahn spokesman joerg boehnisch said , referring to temperatures dropping to minus 20 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
according to boehnisch , the technical failures on the ice trains are similar to those that brought eurostar trains , which run between london , brussels and paris , to a standstill this past weekend .
" a series of trains have broken down because , as with the eurostar trains , dry powder snow is drawn through the ventilation grill into the train and can affect the electrical components , " he explained .
transport minister acknowledges problem travelers whose trains are delayed up to an hour will receive a 25 percent reduction of their fare while those who must wait two hours will be given 50 percent of their ticket price back .
passengers who are unable to complete their journey because their train has been cancelled will be reimbursed completely .
german transport minister peter ramsauer told daily sueddeutsche zeitung that for many passengers the timetable issues were " more than annoying .

however he defended the little progress that was made at the meeting of representatives from over 190 countries .
" i think that people are justified in being disappointed about the outcome in copenhagen , " obama told pbs television wednesday after the summit ended with only vague prescriptions to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
" the science says that we 've got to significantly reduce emissions over the next 40 years .
there 's nothing in the copenhagen agreement that ensures that that happens , " he acknowledged .
but obama added : " what i said was essentially that rather than see a complete collapse in copenhagen ... at least we kind of held ground and there was n't too much backsliding from where we were . "

sweden , which currently holds the eu presidency , described the copenhagen agreement as a disaster for the environment , while german chancellor angela merkel was slightly more upbeat , commenting that the accord was something that " now needed to be built upon . "
in the aftermath of the conference developed and developing nations have traded blows over who was to blame for the weak deal that was reached .
britain accused china of hijacking the proceedings , while brazil attacked the perceived lack of commitment shown by washington .
in turn , india harangued australia for being an " ayatollah of the single track , " and small island nations like tuvalu accused rich nations of blatant disregard for their plight. dfm / afp / reuters editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for over 20 years , postal workers have written back . it 's a tradition for young children around the world to send letters to santa claus with their wishes for christmas .
german children , however , practice a slightly different tradition .
they often send letters to the christkind , who is responsible for bringing the presents on christmas .
the christkind is a symbolic representation of the christmas spirit that is often depicted as a christmas angel .
many of those letters land in a small town in western germany called engelskirchen .
translated , the town 's name means " angels ' church " - a fitting name for the seasonal home of a christmas post office .
the post office , located on the town 's aptly named " angels ' square , " is one of six official addresses in germany for letters addressed to the christkind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans picture the christkind as a kind of fairy , or angel the tradition started in 1985 , when other post offices around germany were n't sure what to do with letters addressed to the christkind .
" since engelskirchen was such a nice name , they ended up just sending them there , " said britta toellner , a spokeswoman for germany 's mail carrier deutsche post .
" and at the time , there was a manager here who opened the letters and saw that they were christmas lists , so just for fun , she answered a few . "
the christkind 's new home before long , a few turned into many , as mountains of letters started arriving in engelskirchen .
the postal workers started taking letters home with them to write responses to children hoping to hear from the christkind .
but at some point , it got to be too much to handle as a side project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letters come in from all over the world " we were getting so many letters from all corners of the earth that we decided to get organized , " toeller said .
" during the holidays , we rent an office and have up to 12 helpers who answer the thousands of letters that come every day . "
last year , 145,000 letters were sent to the christmas post office in engelskirchen , and the number is expected to grow this year .
most of the letters are classic christmas wish lists , with requests ranging from toys to companionship in the form of pets or siblings .
wish lists answers to the letters are written very diplomatically , explaining for instance that not every wish can be granted .
but the postal workers try and include a small gift to tide the children over until christmas , such as small paper cut-outs .
while many children ask the christkind to bring them presents , the christmas post office often receives personal and endearing messages from children .
" for example , kids will ask ' can you say hello to my mother ?
she 's in heaven and lives with you there . '
those letters are tough to take , " said toeller .
" increasingly , they are also thinking of the bigger picture .
we used to see lots of messages for peace on earth and goodwill toward people , which they often simply picked up somewhere , but now kids are noticing that something is not quite right with the environment .
and they speak their minds about it . "
the letters come from all over the world , some from countries as far away as australia , japan , or togo .
no matter where they come from , children write to the christkind in the spirit of christmas .
and in that same spirit , the workers at germany 's christmas post office in engelskirchen write back .

this comes after much international criticism over the bill . in its current form , the bill proposes life imprisonment and even the death penalty for gays and lesbians in uganda .
museveni 's top aide said on thursday that the president was planning to intervene to address the concerns of uganda 's western partners who have expressed strong opposition to the bill .
" we should not have an extreme position .
the president will harmonize the two sides and address the concerns of the europeans and our other development partners . " said museveni 's spokesman .
international condemnation the bill , which is yet to be debated in uganda 's parliament , would have gay men and lesbians sentenced to life in prison for having sex .
in cases of sex with minors or sexual acts leading to hiv infection , the penalty would be death .
the bill also proposes that anyone who fails to report a homosexual act committed by others would face up to three years in jail .

this comes after much international criticism over the bill . in its current form , the bill proposes life imprisonment and even the death penalty for gays and lesbians in uganda .
museveni 's top aide said on thursday that the president was planning to intervene to address the concerns of uganda 's western partners who have expressed strong opposition to the bill .
" we should not have an extreme position .
the president will harmonize the two sides and address the concerns of the europeans and our other development partners . " said museveni 's spokesman .
international condemnation the bill , which is yet to be debated in uganda 's parliament , would have gay men and lesbians sentenced to life in prison for having sex .
in cases of sex with minors or sexual acts leading to hiv infection , the penalty would be death .
the bill also proposes that anyone who fails to report a homosexual act committed by others would face up to three years in jail .
international reaction to the bill has been widespread condemnation , with some western states threatening to withdraw aid to uganda if the government passes the bill into law .
there has also been outcry from the country 's small gay and lesbian community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : church groups worldwide have condemned the bill the world council of churches -lrb- wcc -rrb- has also criticized the bill , saying it would run against basic christian teaching by promoting hatred .

a top anglican cleric of ugandan decent in the uk , archbishop of york john sentamu , said he was " totally opposed to the death sentence " and found the language being used to describe homosexuals " upsetting " .
uganda denies bowing to the west uganda 's ethics and integrity minister nsaba buturo said the revised law would most likely make life in prison the maximum penalty for offenders .
" there have been a lot of discussions in government regarding the proposed law , but we now think a life sentence could be better because it gives room for offenders to be rehabilitated , " he said .
" killing them might not be helpful , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 24.12.2009 mercedes deal with schumacher draws criticism as fans celebrate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have questioned the business sense of schumacher 's signing mercedes ' decision to hire the services of michael schumacher to spearhead its formula one campaign has drawn criticism .
the logic of the move has been questioned , but the fans are just happy to see their hero back . the appointment of michael schumacher is making waves – with some claiming that carmaker mercedes has got its business priorities wrong .
german racing fans , on the other hand , appear to be delighted and schumacher will be happy to know that – after three years in retirement – he even has the full support of his wife .
mercedes secured the services of the 40-year-old german on wednesday , in a one-year deal .
the seven time drivers ' champion is to earn around seven million euros -lrb- $ 10 million -rrb- .
the move drew criticism from the mercedes labor representatives in light of recession cost-cutting measures by brand owner daimler .
" it 's hard to put across to people , " the chairman of mercedes ' bremen works council , uwe werner , told the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions have expressed criticism about the timing of the move " the daimler board decrees , on the one hand , harsh austerity measures for the workforce , and has shifted some production to facilities in other countries .
on the other hand it spends tens of millions on formula one .
it is incomprehensible to many workers . "
werner added that the company 's cost cutting measures would have received more support if mercedes had pulled out of formula one altogether .
deal " will sell cars " the head of mercedes motor sports , norbert haug , disagrees .
he said that the company would make money as a result of formula one and , in particular , signing the star driver .
" the whole issue will sell many cars and the caliber of the star will make a lot of people sit up and pay attention , " said haug .
the investment will not pay off for the company according to ferdinand dudenhoeffer , an economics professor at the university of duisburg-essen who specializes in the car industry .
he questions whether customers will buy a mercedes based on the fact that the brand had a formula one presence .
" you can hardly comprehend it . they will have to charge about 200 to 300 euros more for every car sold , to finance the formula one campaign for mercedes .
mercedes is a company for which sportiness is not the main selling point , it is instead based on safety and on quality on the road . "
rush on race tickets despite this , many german fans are euphoric at the news – with a rush on tickets for the race at hockenheim next july .
formula one supremo bernie ecclestone hailed the news as " fantastic " and predicted a " jaw-dropping season . "
" i think it is fantastic for formula one that he turned into a comeback kid but at the same time i also think it 's good for michael , " said ecclestone .
" when drivers have put in many years they sometimes lose focus and motivation – probably that was one of the reasons for his retirement in 2006 – but now he has again put all his strength together and has a 100 percent motivation level and that will give us many exciting races in 2010 .
forget about winning races – i have him on my bill for winning the championship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher was formula one world champion seven times and schumacher himself said he was confident of his abilities .
" obviously our only goal can be to fight for the world championship , " he told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
he said he has " no doubt " about his skills behind the wheel .
" i never stopped my physical training , " he said .
support from home schumacher can count on the full support of his wife of 14 years corinna .
" he knows exactly what he is doing and he knows that i am always behind him , " she said .
" he needs his challenges ; that 's just michael .
i understand it and i think it 's really great . "
she acknowledged that family life would be turned upside down , but said that when her husband told her of the call he had from his former and new team boss ross brawn " i immediately sensed that there was this fire burning inside him that i know so well . " schumacher had already tried to re-enter the sport this year , standing in for injured brazilian felipe massa for his former employer , ferrari .
but a motorcycle neck injury , from which schumacher says he has recovered , cut short any comeback attempt. rc / sid / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german racing fans , on the other hand , appear to be delighted and schumacher will be happy to know that – after three years in retirement – he even has the full support of his wife .
mercedes secured the services of the 40-year-old german on wednesday , in a one-year deal .
the seven time drivers ' champion is to earn around seven million euros -lrb- $ 10 million -rrb- .
the move drew criticism from the mercedes labor representatives in light of recession cost-cutting measures by brand owner daimler .
" it 's hard to put across to people , " the chairman of mercedes ' bremen works council , uwe werner , told the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions have expressed criticism about the timing of the move " the daimler board decrees , on the one hand , harsh austerity measures for the workforce , and has shifted some production to facilities in other countries .
on the other hand it spends tens of millions on formula one .
it is incomprehensible to many workers . "
werner added that the company 's cost cutting measures would have received more support if mercedes had pulled out of formula one altogether .
deal " will sell cars " the head of mercedes motor sports , norbert haug , disagrees .
he said that the company would make money as a result of formula one and , in particular , signing the star driver .
" the whole issue will sell many cars and the caliber of the star will make a lot of people sit up and pay attention , " said haug .
the investment will not pay off for the company according to ferdinand dudenhoeffer , an economics professor at the university of duisburg-essen who specializes in the car industry .
he questions whether customers will buy a mercedes based on the fact that the brand had a formula one presence .
" you can hardly comprehend it . they will have to charge about 200 to 300 euros more for every car sold , to finance the formula one campaign for mercedes .
mercedes is a company for which sportiness is not the main selling point , it is instead based on safety and on quality on the road . "
rush on race tickets despite this , many german fans are euphoric at the news – with a rush on tickets for the race at hockenheim next july .
formula one supremo bernie ecclestone hailed the news as " fantastic " and predicted a " jaw-dropping season . "
" i think it is fantastic for formula one that he turned into a comeback kid but at the same time i also think it 's good for michael , " said ecclestone .
" when drivers have put in many years they sometimes lose focus and motivation – probably that was one of the reasons for his retirement in 2006 – but now he has again put all his strength together and has a 100 percent motivation level and that will give us many exciting races in 2010 .
forget about winning races – i have him on my bill for winning the championship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher was formula one world champion seven times and schumacher himself said he was confident of his abilities .
" obviously our only goal can be to fight for the world championship , " he told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
he said he has " no doubt " about his skills behind the wheel .
" i never stopped my physical training , " he said .
support from home schumacher can count on the full support of his wife of 14 years corinna .
" he knows exactly what he is doing and he knows that i am always behind him , " she said .
" he needs his challenges ; that 's just michael .
i understand it and i think it 's really great . "
she acknowledged that family life would be turned upside down , but said that when her husband told her of the call he had from his former and new team boss ross brawn " i immediately sensed that there was this fire burning inside him that i know so well . " schumacher had already tried to re-enter the sport this year , standing in for injured brazilian felipe massa for his former employer , ferrari .

1 2009 , beijing ’ s tiananmen square was transformed into a stage to celebrate the founding of the people ’ s republic of china 60 years ago .
there was a large military parade to demonstrate china 's military might .
despite the country 's economic strengths , it still has far to go in terms of human rights . president hu jintao opened the 60th anniversary ceremony to firing canons , wearing a suit like mao zedong 's .
a two-hour parade , which included tanks and missiles , 8,000 soldiers , 60 floats and 100,000 well trained civilians symbolised the country ’ s growing military and economic might .
but there was much criticism of china on the occasion .
in hong kong , for example , there were massive demonstrations against the lack of progress on human rights and democracy .
earlier on in 2009 , on the 50th anniversary of the failed tibetan uprising in march , people all over the world demonstrated for tibet ’ s autonomy .
after 50 years in exile , the dalai lama has not given up the fight .
“ the problem with the people ’ s republic of china is that they consider me a trouble maker , ” he said this year .
“ so it is my duty to create more trouble . ”
trouble in xinjiang there was also “ trouble ” in china 's north-western region of xinjiang , where the uighurs and majority han chinese clashed in july , causing some 200 deaths .
the mainly muslim uighurs complain - like many other minorities in china - of cultural and religious repression .
2009 also marked the 20th anniversary of the massacre on tiananmen square , which can arguably be considered the most potent symbol of chinese repression in the country ’ s recent past .
the chinese media were banned from discussing it .
the british human rights risk atlas ranked china 12th “ most risky country ” overall for human rights this year .
for child labour , forced labour , and violations of freedom of association , discrimination and working conditions , china ranked highest .
“ no transparency in china ” liu xiaobo is one of china 's most prominent dissidents and is currently awaiting sentencing on charges of subversion .
" i have lost faith , ” his wife liu xia said in august .
“ there is absolutely no transparency here .
if you live in a country in which freedom of speech isn ’ t worth a dime , anyone can be convicted . ”
“ i am very worried , ” she continued .
“ they have accused him of felonies , for which he could receive up to 15 years in prison .
he didn ’ t do anything , aside from telling the truth and stating his opinion .
here in china they call that ‘ breaking the law ’ . ”
liu xiaobo 's sentence is expected to be handed down on christmas day .
optimism about economic situation although china was criticised for its human rights record , its economic situation in 2009 gave rise to hope .
despite world recession , china ’ s economy continued to grow at a rate of eight to 10 percent .
the optimism expressed by many economists at the beginning of the year seems to have been vindicated .
“ the statistics are showing recovery in many sectors of the economy , ” the head of the chinese central bank , zhal xiaochuan , said in january .
“ this means that our economic stimulus programme is taking hold .
the chinese state council has made it clear that our reaction to the crisis must be quick and resolute . ”
the positive signs in china 's economy have been attributed to an increase in chinese consumerism and lending and investments abroad .
with this strategy , experts say china is leading the world out of the financial crisis and will continue to do so in 2010 .

a new german study of organic and ethical fashion shows the growing industry is n't all it 's cracked up to be - especially when it comes to verifying adherence to " green " standards . recent years have seen a boom in the the organic , socially conscious textile industry .
small ethical t-shirt companies are shooting up left and right , and even big producers like hennes & mauritz have jumped on the bandwagon , making a line of organic cotton clothes .
in light of this , the german non-profit organization suedwind tested these companies to see if they delivered what they advertised - and to what extent .
questionnaires were sent out to 240 companies whose ecologically or socially conscious products can be ordered online in germany .
just 23 companies - 17 of them german - responded .
verification is an issue suedwind said the aim of the study was to see how closely the companies complied with generally accepted industry standards for ethical production , such as widespread international labor organization conventions and fair-trade labelling rules , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fairtrade is one of several groups out to verify compliance " many companies call themselves green , or ethical or fair , " said dominic kloos , who ran the suedwind study .
" but are they really ethical or ecological ?
that 's what we wanted to find out . "
kloos acknowledged that the low rate of response meant the study shows " tendencies " rather than giving a full picture of the industry .
but overall , despite progress , he said the results showed that " many … complied with some of the most important standards , but not with all of them . "
seven ' green ' criteria the suedwind study examined seven criteria , from checking ecological standards -lrb- are all components certified organic ? -rrb- and social ones -lrb- does the company comply with the " clean clothes campaign " code of conduct throughout its entire production chain ? -rrb- .
it also looked at verification measures , transparency levels , raw materials sourcing , and the chemical content of the clothes , among others .
" the main outcome is that ecological standards are easier to verify than social ones , " kloos said .
while environmental standards can be verified by certification agencies , social standards can only be upheld if a company is a member of a so-called multi-stakeholder initiative , or if they are a cooperative , " which means the work standards are in the workers ' hands , " kloos said .
overall , the study showed that 69 percent of the companies said they fulfilled basic social conventions , while 22 percent in accordance with listed ecological standards .
of those , 35 percent had external verification procedures for ecological standards - but only four of the 23 companies said they externally verified social standards .
raising the bar kloos acknowledged that his job is to " raise the bar very high " when shining a light on company behaviors .
but the fact that eco-clothing companies exist at all is a good sign for the future of the textile industry : " it 's great that these niche companies exist - they put pressure on the market , so that bigger companies , like h & m , come out with organic clothing , " he said .
ultimately , though , we do n't need to improve social and ecological standards on a voluntary basis , kloos said .
" what we need is legally binding rules . "

the pkk is a separatist militant group , which is regarded by the european union as a terrorist organization .
among those held in diyarbakir was a lawyer for the jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan .
raids across country the raids took place in cities across the southeast of the country as well as in istanbul and the capital , ankara .
the ban on the dtp , which led to days of unrest in kurdish areas of turkey , was opposed by prime minister tayyip erdogan .
erdogan had been trying to resolve a conflict that has cost around 40,000 lives over the past 25 years .
kurds make up about 20 percent of turkey 's 71 million population , and were forbidden from using their language for decades . following the raids , around 1,000 people gathered outside the diyarbakir office of the peace and democratic party -lrb- bdp -rrb- , which also represents kurds .
warning to government city mayor osman baydemir spoke to the crowd and warned the national government that , if the detentions continued , it would have no-one to negotiate with .
" if this process of purges continues , i state it very obviously : a day will come when you will find no-one to shake hands with , " said baydemir .
the european commission has condemned the banning of the dtp , while also criticizing the party for retaining links with the pkk .
turkey is involved in negotiations to join the european union but has been criticized for its human rights record .
legislators from the dtp announced last friday that they would join the bdp to stay in parliament. rc / ape / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new german study of organic and ethical fashion shows the growing industry is n't all it 's cracked up to be - especially when it comes to verifying adherence to " green " standards . recent years have seen a boom in the the organic , socially conscious textile industry .
small ethical t-shirt companies are shooting up left and right , and even big producers like hennes & mauritz have jumped on the bandwagon , making a line of organic cotton clothes .
in light of this , the german non-profit organization suedwind tested these companies to see if they delivered what they advertised - and to what extent .
questionnaires were sent out to 240 companies whose ecologically or socially conscious products can be ordered online in germany .
just 23 companies - 17 of them german - responded .
verification is an issue suedwind said the aim of the study was to see how closely the companies complied with generally accepted industry standards for ethical production , such as widespread international labor organization conventions and fair-trade labelling rules , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fairtrade is one of several groups out to verify compliance " many companies call themselves green , or ethical or fair , " said dominic kloos , who ran the suedwind study .
" but are they really ethical or ecological ?
that 's what we wanted to find out . "
kloos acknowledged that the low rate of response meant the study shows " tendencies " rather than giving a full picture of the industry .
but overall , despite progress , he said the results showed that " many … complied with some of the most important standards , but not with all of them . "
seven ' green ' criteria the suedwind study examined seven criteria , from checking ecological standards -lrb- are all components certified organic ? -rrb- and social ones -lrb- does the company comply with the " clean clothes campaign " code of conduct throughout its entire production chain ? -rrb- .
it also looked at verification measures , transparency levels , raw materials sourcing , and the chemical content of the clothes , among others .
" the main outcome is that ecological standards are easier to verify than social ones , " kloos said .
while environmental standards can be verified by certification agencies , social standards can only be upheld if a company is a member of a so-called multi-stakeholder initiative , or if they are a cooperative , " which means the work standards are in the workers ' hands , " kloos said .
overall , the study showed that 69 percent of the companies said they fulfilled basic social conventions , while 22 percent in accordance with listed ecological standards .
of those , 35 percent had external verification procedures for ecological standards - but only four of the 23 companies said they externally verified social standards .
raising the bar kloos acknowledged that his job is to " raise the bar very high " when shining a light on company behaviors .
but the fact that eco-clothing companies exist at all is a good sign for the future of the textile industry : " it 's great that these niche companies exist - they put pressure on the market , so that bigger companies , like h & m , come out with organic clothing , " he said .
ultimately , though , we do n't need to improve social and ecological standards on a voluntary basis , kloos said .
" what we need is legally binding rules . "

germany 's rail operator deutsche bahn announced on wednesday that only one out of two regularly scheduled trains would be running on the high speed ice route connecting berlin , leipzig and munich until after christmas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramsauer says delays are ' more than annoying ' the reason : excessive snow and ice have taken too many trains out of action .
trains ' not built for these temperatures ' " the trains are not built to withstand these siberian temperatures , " deutsche bahn spokesman joerg boehnisch said , referring to temperatures dropping to minus 20 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
according to boehnisch , the technical failures on the ice trains are similar to those that brought eurostar trains , which run between london , brussels and paris , to a standstill this past weekend .
" a series of trains have broken down because , as with the eurostar trains , dry powder snow is drawn through the ventilation grill into the train and can affect the electrical components , " he explained .
transport minister acknowledges problem travelers whose trains are delayed up to an hour will receive a 25 percent reduction of their fare while those who must wait two hours will be given 50 percent of their ticket price back .
passengers who are unable to complete their journey because their train has been cancelled will be reimbursed completely .

for over 20 years , postal workers have written back . it 's a tradition for young children around the world to send letters to santa claus with their wishes for christmas .
german children , however , practice a slightly different tradition .
they often send letters to the christkind , who is responsible for bringing the presents on christmas .
the christkind is a symbolic representation of the christmas spirit that is often depicted as a christmas angel .
many of those letters land in a small town in western germany called engelskirchen .
translated , the town 's name means " angels ' church " - a fitting name for the seasonal home of a christmas post office .
the post office , located on the town 's aptly named " angels ' square , " is one of six official addresses in germany for letters addressed to the christkind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans picture the christkind as a kind of fairy , or angel the tradition started in 1985 , when other post offices around germany were n't sure what to do with letters addressed to the christkind .

" during the holidays , we rent an office and have up to 12 helpers who answer the thousands of letters that come every day . "
last year , 145,000 letters were sent to the christmas post office in engelskirchen , and the number is expected to grow this year .
most of the letters are classic christmas wish lists , with requests ranging from toys to companionship in the form of pets or siblings .
wish lists answers to the letters are written very diplomatically , explaining for instance that not every wish can be granted .
but the postal workers try and include a small gift to tide the children over until christmas , such as small paper cut-outs .
while many children ask the christkind to bring them presents , the christmas post office often receives personal and endearing messages from children .
" for example , kids will ask ' can you say hello to my mother ?
she 's in heaven and lives with you there . '
those letters are tough to take , " said toeller .
" increasingly , they are also thinking of the bigger picture .
we used to see lots of messages for peace on earth and goodwill toward people , which they often simply picked up somewhere , but now kids are noticing that something is not quite right with the environment .
and they speak their minds about it . "
the letters come from all over the world , some from countries as far away as australia , japan , or togo .
no matter where they come from , children write to the christkind in the spirit of christmas .

however he defended the little progress that was made at the meeting of representatives from over 190 countries .
" i think that people are justified in being disappointed about the outcome in copenhagen , " obama told pbs television wednesday after the summit ended with only vague prescriptions to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
" the science says that we 've got to significantly reduce emissions over the next 40 years .
there 's nothing in the copenhagen agreement that ensures that that happens , " he acknowledged .
but obama added : " what i said was essentially that rather than see a complete collapse in copenhagen ... at least we kind of held ground and there was n't too much backsliding from where we were . "
the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel said observers should refrain from " bad mouthing " the summit outcome but it prompted criticism for not setting tough , legally binding limits on future carbon emissions for the 193 nations present .
finger pointing earlier this week the european union sought to shift much of the blame for the outcome of the summit on the us and china , the world 's two largest emitters of carbon dioxide which most scientists believe is a leading cause of anthropogenic climate change .
sweden , which currently holds the eu presidency , described the copenhagen agreement as a disaster for the environment , while german chancellor angela merkel was slightly more upbeat , commenting that the accord was something that " now needed to be built upon . "

mercedes secured the services of the 40-year-old german on wednesday , in a one-year deal .
the seven time drivers ' champion is to earn around seven million euros -lrb- $ 10 million -rrb- .
the move drew criticism from the mercedes labor representatives in light of recession cost-cutting measures by brand owner daimler .

this comes after much international criticism over the bill . in its current form , the bill proposes life imprisonment and even the death penalty for gays and lesbians in uganda .
museveni 's top aide said on thursday that the president was planning to intervene to address the concerns of uganda 's western partners who have expressed strong opposition to the bill .
" we should not have an extreme position .
the president will harmonize the two sides and address the concerns of the europeans and our other development partners . " said museveni 's spokesman .
international condemnation the bill , which is yet to be debated in uganda 's parliament , would have gay men and lesbians sentenced to life in prison for having sex .
in cases of sex with minors or sexual acts leading to hiv infection , the penalty would be death .
the bill also proposes that anyone who fails to report a homosexual act committed by others would face up to three years in jail .
international reaction to the bill has been widespread condemnation , with some western states threatening to withdraw aid to uganda if the government passes the bill into law .
there has also been outcry from the country 's small gay and lesbian community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : church groups worldwide have condemned the bill the world council of churches -lrb- wcc -rrb- has also criticized the bill , saying it would run against basic christian teaching by promoting hatred .
" from the experience of many nations , it is very clear that if such a bill is enacted into law , it will leave a lot of room for manipulation , abuse , blackmail and oppression of people " said wcc chief samuel kobia .
a top anglican cleric of ugandan decent in the uk , archbishop of york john sentamu , said he was " totally opposed to the death sentence " and found the language being used to describe homosexuals " upsetting " .
uganda denies bowing to the west uganda 's ethics and integrity minister nsaba buturo said the revised law would most likely make life in prison the maximum penalty for offenders .
" there have been a lot of discussions in government regarding the proposed law , but we now think a life sentence could be better because it gives room for offenders to be rehabilitated , " he said .
" killing them might not be helpful , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east-african state has benefitted from western aid and investment however , buturo denied the change in government attitude was forced by western pressure .
" it 's really out of our consultation with various groups , including religious leaders .
it has nothing to do with external forces , " he said .
buturo also added that uganda had not changed its view that homosexuality is a " moral perversion that must not be allowed to spread " .
uganda has long benefitted from western aid and investment due to its stable economy and widespread economic reforms. mk / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 24.12.2009 study finds ' green ' clothing companies are lacking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these shirts look good - but how were they made ?
a new german study of organic and ethical fashion shows the growing industry is n't all it 's cracked up to be - especially when it comes to verifying adherence to " green " standards . recent years have seen a boom in the the organic , socially conscious textile industry .
small ethical t-shirt companies are shooting up left and right , and even big producers like hennes & mauritz have jumped on the bandwagon , making a line of organic cotton clothes .
in light of this , the german non-profit organization suedwind tested these companies to see if they delivered what they advertised - and to what extent .
questionnaires were sent out to 240 companies whose ecologically or socially conscious products can be ordered online in germany .
just 23 companies - 17 of them german - responded .
verification is an issue suedwind said the aim of the study was to see how closely the companies complied with generally accepted industry standards for ethical production , such as widespread international labor organization conventions and fair-trade labelling rules , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fairtrade is one of several groups out to verify compliance " many companies call themselves green , or ethical or fair , " said dominic kloos , who ran the suedwind study .
" but are they really ethical or ecological ?
that 's what we wanted to find out . "
kloos acknowledged that the low rate of response meant the study shows " tendencies " rather than giving a full picture of the industry .
but overall , despite progress , he said the results showed that " many … complied with some of the most important standards , but not with all of them . "
seven ' green ' criteria the suedwind study examined seven criteria , from checking ecological standards -lrb- are all components certified organic ? -rrb- and social ones -lrb- does the company comply with the " clean clothes campaign " code of conduct throughout its entire production chain ? -rrb- .
it also looked at verification measures , transparency levels , raw materials sourcing , and the chemical content of the clothes , among others .
" the main outcome is that ecological standards are easier to verify than social ones , " kloos said .
while environmental standards can be verified by certification agencies , social standards can only be upheld if a company is a member of a so-called multi-stakeholder initiative , or if they are a cooperative , " which means the work standards are in the workers ' hands , " kloos said .
overall , the study showed that 69 percent of the companies said they fulfilled basic social conventions , while 22 percent in accordance with listed ecological standards .
of those , 35 percent had external verification procedures for ecological standards - but only four of the 23 companies said they externally verified social standards .
raising the bar kloos acknowledged that his job is to " raise the bar very high " when shining a light on company behaviors .
but the fact that eco-clothing companies exist at all is a good sign for the future of the textile industry : " it 's great that these niche companies exist - they put pressure on the market , so that bigger companies , like h & m , come out with organic clothing , " he said .
ultimately , though , we do n't need to improve social and ecological standards on a voluntary basis , kloos said .
" what we need is legally binding rules . "

a new german study of organic and ethical fashion shows the growing industry is n't all it 's cracked up to be - especially when it comes to verifying adherence to " green " standards . recent years have seen a boom in the the organic , socially conscious textile industry .
small ethical t-shirt companies are shooting up left and right , and even big producers like hennes & mauritz have jumped on the bandwagon , making a line of organic cotton clothes .
in light of this , the german non-profit organization suedwind tested these companies to see if they delivered what they advertised - and to what extent .
questionnaires were sent out to 240 companies whose ecologically or socially conscious products can be ordered online in germany .
just 23 companies - 17 of them german - responded .
verification is an issue suedwind said the aim of the study was to see how closely the companies complied with generally accepted industry standards for ethical production , such as widespread international labor organization conventions and fair-trade labelling rules , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fairtrade is one of several groups out to verify compliance " many companies call themselves green , or ethical or fair , " said dominic kloos , who ran the suedwind study .
" but are they really ethical or ecological ?
that 's what we wanted to find out . "
kloos acknowledged that the low rate of response meant the study shows " tendencies " rather than giving a full picture of the industry .
but overall , despite progress , he said the results showed that " many … complied with some of the most important standards , but not with all of them . "
seven ' green ' criteria the suedwind study examined seven criteria , from checking ecological standards -lrb- are all components certified organic ? -rrb- and social ones -lrb- does the company comply with the " clean clothes campaign " code of conduct throughout its entire production chain ? -rrb- .
it also looked at verification measures , transparency levels , raw materials sourcing , and the chemical content of the clothes , among others .
" the main outcome is that ecological standards are easier to verify than social ones , " kloos said .
while environmental standards can be verified by certification agencies , social standards can only be upheld if a company is a member of a so-called multi-stakeholder initiative , or if they are a cooperative , " which means the work standards are in the workers ' hands , " kloos said .
overall , the study showed that 69 percent of the companies said they fulfilled basic social conventions , while 22 percent in accordance with listed ecological standards .
of those , 35 percent had external verification procedures for ecological standards - but only four of the 23 companies said they externally verified social standards .
raising the bar kloos acknowledged that his job is to " raise the bar very high " when shining a light on company behaviors .
but the fact that eco-clothing companies exist at all is a good sign for the future of the textile industry : " it 's great that these niche companies exist - they put pressure on the market , so that bigger companies , like h & m , come out with organic clothing , " he said .
ultimately , though , we do n't need to improve social and ecological standards on a voluntary basis , kloos said .
" what we need is legally binding rules . "

this comes after much international criticism over the bill . in its current form , the bill proposes life imprisonment and even the death penalty for gays and lesbians in uganda .
museveni 's top aide said on thursday that the president was planning to intervene to address the concerns of uganda 's western partners who have expressed strong opposition to the bill .
" we should not have an extreme position .
the president will harmonize the two sides and address the concerns of the europeans and our other development partners . " said museveni 's spokesman .
international condemnation the bill , which is yet to be debated in uganda 's parliament , would have gay men and lesbians sentenced to life in prison for having sex .
in cases of sex with minors or sexual acts leading to hiv infection , the penalty would be death .
the bill also proposes that anyone who fails to report a homosexual act committed by others would face up to three years in jail .
international reaction to the bill has been widespread condemnation , with some western states threatening to withdraw aid to uganda if the government passes the bill into law .
there has also been outcry from the country 's small gay and lesbian community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : church groups worldwide have condemned the bill the world council of churches -lrb- wcc -rrb- has also criticized the bill , saying it would run against basic christian teaching by promoting hatred .
" from the experience of many nations , it is very clear that if such a bill is enacted into law , it will leave a lot of room for manipulation , abuse , blackmail and oppression of people " said wcc chief samuel kobia .
a top anglican cleric of ugandan decent in the uk , archbishop of york john sentamu , said he was " totally opposed to the death sentence " and found the language being used to describe homosexuals " upsetting " .
uganda denies bowing to the west uganda 's ethics and integrity minister nsaba buturo said the revised law would most likely make life in prison the maximum penalty for offenders .
" there have been a lot of discussions in government regarding the proposed law , but we now think a life sentence could be better because it gives room for offenders to be rehabilitated , " he said .
" killing them might not be helpful , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east-african state has benefitted from western aid and investment however , buturo denied the change in government attitude was forced by western pressure .
" it 's really out of our consultation with various groups , including religious leaders .
it has nothing to do with external forces , " he said .
buturo also added that uganda had not changed its view that homosexuality is a " moral perversion that must not be allowed to spread " .

the logic of the move has been questioned , but the fans are just happy to see their hero back . the appointment of michael schumacher is making waves – with some claiming that carmaker mercedes has got its business priorities wrong .
german racing fans , on the other hand , appear to be delighted and schumacher will be happy to know that – after three years in retirement – he even has the full support of his wife .
mercedes secured the services of the 40-year-old german on wednesday , in a one-year deal .
the seven time drivers ' champion is to earn around seven million euros -lrb- $ 10 million -rrb- .
the move drew criticism from the mercedes labor representatives in light of recession cost-cutting measures by brand owner daimler .
" it 's hard to put across to people , " the chairman of mercedes ' bremen works council , uwe werner , told the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions have expressed criticism about the timing of the move " the daimler board decrees , on the one hand , harsh austerity measures for the workforce , and has shifted some production to facilities in other countries .
on the other hand it spends tens of millions on formula one .
it is incomprehensible to many workers . "
werner added that the company 's cost cutting measures would have received more support if mercedes had pulled out of formula one altogether .
deal " will sell cars " the head of mercedes motor sports , norbert haug , disagrees .
he said that the company would make money as a result of formula one and , in particular , signing the star driver .
" the whole issue will sell many cars and the caliber of the star will make a lot of people sit up and pay attention , " said haug .
the investment will not pay off for the company according to ferdinand dudenhoeffer , an economics professor at the university of duisburg-essen who specializes in the car industry .
he questions whether customers will buy a mercedes based on the fact that the brand had a formula one presence .
" you can hardly comprehend it . they will have to charge about 200 to 300 euros more for every car sold , to finance the formula one campaign for mercedes .
mercedes is a company for which sportiness is not the main selling point , it is instead based on safety and on quality on the road . "
rush on race tickets despite this , many german fans are euphoric at the news – with a rush on tickets for the race at hockenheim next july .
formula one supremo bernie ecclestone hailed the news as " fantastic " and predicted a " jaw-dropping season . "
" i think it is fantastic for formula one that he turned into a comeback kid but at the same time i also think it 's good for michael , " said ecclestone .
" when drivers have put in many years they sometimes lose focus and motivation – probably that was one of the reasons for his retirement in 2006 – but now he has again put all his strength together and has a 100 percent motivation level and that will give us many exciting races in 2010 .

he said he has " no doubt " about his skills behind the wheel .
" i never stopped my physical training , " he said .

" he knows exactly what he is doing and he knows that i am always behind him , " she said .
" he needs his challenges ; that 's just michael .
i understand it and i think it 's really great . "

however he defended the little progress that was made at the meeting of representatives from over 190 countries .
" i think that people are justified in being disappointed about the outcome in copenhagen , " obama told pbs television wednesday after the summit ended with only vague prescriptions to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
" the science says that we 've got to significantly reduce emissions over the next 40 years .
there 's nothing in the copenhagen agreement that ensures that that happens , " he acknowledged .
but obama added : " what i said was essentially that rather than see a complete collapse in copenhagen ... at least we kind of held ground and there was n't too much backsliding from where we were . "
the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel said observers should refrain from " bad mouthing " the summit outcome but it prompted criticism for not setting tough , legally binding limits on future carbon emissions for the 193 nations present .
finger pointing earlier this week the european union sought to shift much of the blame for the outcome of the summit on the us and china , the world 's two largest emitters of carbon dioxide which most scientists believe is a leading cause of anthropogenic climate change .
sweden , which currently holds the eu presidency , described the copenhagen agreement as a disaster for the environment , while german chancellor angela merkel was slightly more upbeat , commenting that the accord was something that " now needed to be built upon . "
in the aftermath of the conference developed and developing nations have traded blows over who was to blame for the weak deal that was reached .
britain accused china of hijacking the proceedings , while brazil attacked the perceived lack of commitment shown by washington .
in turn , india harangued australia for being an " ayatollah of the single track , " and small island nations like tuvalu accused rich nations of blatant disregard for their plight. dfm / afp / reuters editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's rail operator deutsche bahn announced on wednesday that only one out of two regularly scheduled trains would be running on the high speed ice route connecting berlin , leipzig and munich until after christmas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramsauer says delays are ' more than annoying ' the reason : excessive snow and ice have taken too many trains out of action .
trains ' not built for these temperatures ' " the trains are not built to withstand these siberian temperatures , " deutsche bahn spokesman joerg boehnisch said , referring to temperatures dropping to minus 20 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
according to boehnisch , the technical failures on the ice trains are similar to those that brought eurostar trains , which run between london , brussels and paris , to a standstill this past weekend .
" a series of trains have broken down because , as with the eurostar trains , dry powder snow is drawn through the ventilation grill into the train and can affect the electrical components , " he explained .
transport minister acknowledges problem travelers whose trains are delayed up to an hour will receive a 25 percent reduction of their fare while those who must wait two hours will be given 50 percent of their ticket price back .
passengers who are unable to complete their journey because their train has been cancelled will be reimbursed completely .

this comes after much international criticism over the bill . in its current form , the bill proposes life imprisonment and even the death penalty for gays and lesbians in uganda .
museveni 's top aide said on thursday that the president was planning to intervene to address the concerns of uganda 's western partners who have expressed strong opposition to the bill .
" we should not have an extreme position .
the president will harmonize the two sides and address the concerns of the europeans and our other development partners . " said museveni 's spokesman .
international condemnation the bill , which is yet to be debated in uganda 's parliament , would have gay men and lesbians sentenced to life in prison for having sex .
in cases of sex with minors or sexual acts leading to hiv infection , the penalty would be death .
the bill also proposes that anyone who fails to report a homosexual act committed by others would face up to three years in jail .
international reaction to the bill has been widespread condemnation , with some western states threatening to withdraw aid to uganda if the government passes the bill into law .
there has also been outcry from the country 's small gay and lesbian community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : church groups worldwide have condemned the bill the world council of churches -lrb- wcc -rrb- has also criticized the bill , saying it would run against basic christian teaching by promoting hatred .
" from the experience of many nations , it is very clear that if such a bill is enacted into law , it will leave a lot of room for manipulation , abuse , blackmail and oppression of people " said wcc chief samuel kobia .
a top anglican cleric of ugandan decent in the uk , archbishop of york john sentamu , said he was " totally opposed to the death sentence " and found the language being used to describe homosexuals " upsetting " .
uganda denies bowing to the west uganda 's ethics and integrity minister nsaba buturo said the revised law would most likely make life in prison the maximum penalty for offenders .
" there have been a lot of discussions in government regarding the proposed law , but we now think a life sentence could be better because it gives room for offenders to be rehabilitated , " he said .
" killing them might not be helpful , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east-african state has benefitted from western aid and investment however , buturo denied the change in government attitude was forced by western pressure .
" it 's really out of our consultation with various groups , including religious leaders .
it has nothing to do with external forces , " he said .
buturo also added that uganda had not changed its view that homosexuality is a " moral perversion that must not be allowed to spread " .
uganda has long benefitted from western aid and investment due to its stable economy and widespread economic reforms. mk / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes after much international criticism over the bill . in its current form , the bill proposes life imprisonment and even the death penalty for gays and lesbians in uganda .
museveni 's top aide said on thursday that the president was planning to intervene to address the concerns of uganda 's western partners who have expressed strong opposition to the bill .
" we should not have an extreme position .
the president will harmonize the two sides and address the concerns of the europeans and our other development partners . " said museveni 's spokesman .
international condemnation the bill , which is yet to be debated in uganda 's parliament , would have gay men and lesbians sentenced to life in prison for having sex .
in cases of sex with minors or sexual acts leading to hiv infection , the penalty would be death .
the bill also proposes that anyone who fails to report a homosexual act committed by others would face up to three years in jail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 24.12.2009 ' dear christkind ' : a german post office answers christmas letters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of letters arrive every christmas in engelskirchen in the small town of engelskirchen , thousands of letters from around the world arrive at a seasonal christmas post office , all addressed to one person .
for over 20 years , postal workers have written back . it 's a tradition for young children around the world to send letters to santa claus with their wishes for christmas .
german children , however , practice a slightly different tradition .
they often send letters to the christkind , who is responsible for bringing the presents on christmas .
the christkind is a symbolic representation of the christmas spirit that is often depicted as a christmas angel .
many of those letters land in a small town in western germany called engelskirchen .
translated , the town 's name means " angels ' church " - a fitting name for the seasonal home of a christmas post office .
the post office , located on the town 's aptly named " angels ' square , " is one of six official addresses in germany for letters addressed to the christkind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans picture the christkind as a kind of fairy , or angel the tradition started in 1985 , when other post offices around germany were n't sure what to do with letters addressed to the christkind .
" since engelskirchen was such a nice name , they ended up just sending them there , " said britta toellner , a spokeswoman for germany 's mail carrier deutsche post .
" and at the time , there was a manager here who opened the letters and saw that they were christmas lists , so just for fun , she answered a few . "
the christkind 's new home before long , a few turned into many , as mountains of letters started arriving in engelskirchen .
the postal workers started taking letters home with them to write responses to children hoping to hear from the christkind .
but at some point , it got to be too much to handle as a side project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letters come in from all over the world " we were getting so many letters from all corners of the earth that we decided to get organized , " toeller said .
" during the holidays , we rent an office and have up to 12 helpers who answer the thousands of letters that come every day . "
last year , 145,000 letters were sent to the christmas post office in engelskirchen , and the number is expected to grow this year .
most of the letters are classic christmas wish lists , with requests ranging from toys to companionship in the form of pets or siblings .
wish lists answers to the letters are written very diplomatically , explaining for instance that not every wish can be granted .
but the postal workers try and include a small gift to tide the children over until christmas , such as small paper cut-outs .
while many children ask the christkind to bring them presents , the christmas post office often receives personal and endearing messages from children .
" for example , kids will ask ' can you say hello to my mother ?
she 's in heaven and lives with you there . '
those letters are tough to take , " said toeller .
" increasingly , they are also thinking of the bigger picture .
we used to see lots of messages for peace on earth and goodwill toward people , which they often simply picked up somewhere , but now kids are noticing that something is not quite right with the environment .
and they speak their minds about it . "
the letters come from all over the world , some from countries as far away as australia , japan , or togo .
no matter where they come from , children write to the christkind in the spirit of christmas .
and in that same spirit , the workers at germany 's christmas post office in engelskirchen write back .

however he defended the little progress that was made at the meeting of representatives from over 190 countries .
" i think that people are justified in being disappointed about the outcome in copenhagen , " obama told pbs television wednesday after the summit ended with only vague prescriptions to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
" the science says that we 've got to significantly reduce emissions over the next 40 years .
there 's nothing in the copenhagen agreement that ensures that that happens , " he acknowledged .
but obama added : " what i said was essentially that rather than see a complete collapse in copenhagen ... at least we kind of held ground and there was n't too much backsliding from where we were . "
the copenhagen accord , which recognizes the need to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade , was effectively passed after angry discussions at the danish capital 's bella centre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel said observers should refrain from " bad mouthing " the summit outcome but it prompted criticism for not setting tough , legally binding limits on future carbon emissions for the 193 nations present .
finger pointing earlier this week the european union sought to shift much of the blame for the outcome of the summit on the us and china , the world 's two largest emitters of carbon dioxide which most scientists believe is a leading cause of anthropogenic climate change .
sweden , which currently holds the eu presidency , described the copenhagen agreement as a disaster for the environment , while german chancellor angela merkel was slightly more upbeat , commenting that the accord was something that " now needed to be built upon . "
in the aftermath of the conference developed and developing nations have traded blows over who was to blame for the weak deal that was reached .
britain accused china of hijacking the proceedings , while brazil attacked the perceived lack of commitment shown by washington .
in turn , india harangued australia for being an " ayatollah of the single track , " and small island nations like tuvalu accused rich nations of blatant disregard for their plight. dfm / afp / reuters editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for over 20 years , postal workers have written back . it 's a tradition for young children around the world to send letters to santa claus with their wishes for christmas .
german children , however , practice a slightly different tradition .
they often send letters to the christkind , who is responsible for bringing the presents on christmas .
the christkind is a symbolic representation of the christmas spirit that is often depicted as a christmas angel .
many of those letters land in a small town in western germany called engelskirchen .
translated , the town 's name means " angels ' church " - a fitting name for the seasonal home of a christmas post office .
the post office , located on the town 's aptly named " angels ' square , " is one of six official addresses in germany for letters addressed to the christkind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans picture the christkind as a kind of fairy , or angel the tradition started in 1985 , when other post offices around germany were n't sure what to do with letters addressed to the christkind .
" since engelskirchen was such a nice name , they ended up just sending them there , " said britta toellner , a spokeswoman for germany 's mail carrier deutsche post .
" and at the time , there was a manager here who opened the letters and saw that they were christmas lists , so just for fun , she answered a few . "
the christkind 's new home before long , a few turned into many , as mountains of letters started arriving in engelskirchen .
the postal workers started taking letters home with them to write responses to children hoping to hear from the christkind .
but at some point , it got to be too much to handle as a side project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letters come in from all over the world " we were getting so many letters from all corners of the earth that we decided to get organized , " toeller said .
" during the holidays , we rent an office and have up to 12 helpers who answer the thousands of letters that come every day . "
last year , 145,000 letters were sent to the christmas post office in engelskirchen , and the number is expected to grow this year .
most of the letters are classic christmas wish lists , with requests ranging from toys to companionship in the form of pets or siblings .
wish lists answers to the letters are written very diplomatically , explaining for instance that not every wish can be granted .
but the postal workers try and include a small gift to tide the children over until christmas , such as small paper cut-outs .
while many children ask the christkind to bring them presents , the christmas post office often receives personal and endearing messages from children .
" for example , kids will ask ' can you say hello to my mother ?
she 's in heaven and lives with you there . '
those letters are tough to take , " said toeller .
" increasingly , they are also thinking of the bigger picture .
we used to see lots of messages for peace on earth and goodwill toward people , which they often simply picked up somewhere , but now kids are noticing that something is not quite right with the environment .
and they speak their minds about it . "
the letters come from all over the world , some from countries as far away as australia , japan , or togo .
no matter where they come from , children write to the christkind in the spirit of christmas .
and in that same spirit , the workers at germany 's christmas post office in engelskirchen write back .

however he defended the little progress that was made at the meeting of representatives from over 190 countries .
" i think that people are justified in being disappointed about the outcome in copenhagen , " obama told pbs television wednesday after the summit ended with only vague prescriptions to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
" the science says that we 've got to significantly reduce emissions over the next 40 years .
there 's nothing in the copenhagen agreement that ensures that that happens , " he acknowledged .

georgian-russian relations have been strained since a short war fought last year . ties between russia and georgia appeared to be improving on thursday after a swiss-brokered deal resulted in a plan to reopen a mountain pass on the border .
all border crossings and flights between the two nations have been closed since the august war fought in 2008 .
" according to our preliminary verbal agreement with the russian side , the verkhny lars checkpoint will open in early march , " georgian deputy foreign minister nino kalandadze told a news conference .
georgia and russia fought a brief war last year over the georgian breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
opening up the border would be the first sign of thaw in diplomatic ties between russia and georgia which were severed after the war .
the russian border service also released a statement citing the " shared need to resume international traffic between georgia and russia . "
all is not forgiven moscow has repeatedly asserted , however , that it would not resume official relations with georgia as long as president mikheil saakashvili remains in power .
kalandadze said the agreement would allow georgian citizens and cargo to cross the border and that a formal protocol on reopening the crossing would be finalized within two weeks .
on tuesday , georgian airlines airzena asked the russian government to allow it to run charter flights between tbilisi and moscow during the winter holiday period .
approximately one million georgians live in russia .
" we assess the resumption of air links positively .
we hope that negotiations between private air companies on resumption of flights will result in a positive decision , " kalandadze said. sjt / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the logic of the move has been questioned , but the fans are just happy to see their hero back . the appointment of michael schumacher is making waves – with some claiming that carmaker mercedes has got its business priorities wrong .
german racing fans , on the other hand , appear to be delighted and schumacher will be happy to know that – after three years in retirement – he even has the full support of his wife .
mercedes secured the services of the 40-year-old german on wednesday , in a one-year deal .
the seven time drivers ' champion is to earn around seven million euros -lrb- $ 10 million -rrb- .
the move drew criticism from the mercedes labor representatives in light of recession cost-cutting measures by brand owner daimler .
" it 's hard to put across to people , " the chairman of mercedes ' bremen works council , uwe werner , told the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions have expressed criticism about the timing of the move " the daimler board decrees , on the one hand , harsh austerity measures for the workforce , and has shifted some production to facilities in other countries .
on the other hand it spends tens of millions on formula one .
it is incomprehensible to many workers . "
werner added that the company 's cost cutting measures would have received more support if mercedes had pulled out of formula one altogether .
deal " will sell cars " the head of mercedes motor sports , norbert haug , disagrees .
he said that the company would make money as a result of formula one and , in particular , signing the star driver .
" the whole issue will sell many cars and the caliber of the star will make a lot of people sit up and pay attention , " said haug .
the investment will not pay off for the company according to ferdinand dudenhoeffer , an economics professor at the university of duisburg-essen who specializes in the car industry .
he questions whether customers will buy a mercedes based on the fact that the brand had a formula one presence .
" you can hardly comprehend it . they will have to charge about 200 to 300 euros more for every car sold , to finance the formula one campaign for mercedes .
mercedes is a company for which sportiness is not the main selling point , it is instead based on safety and on quality on the road . "
rush on race tickets despite this , many german fans are euphoric at the news – with a rush on tickets for the race at hockenheim next july .
formula one supremo bernie ecclestone hailed the news as " fantastic " and predicted a " jaw-dropping season . "
" i think it is fantastic for formula one that he turned into a comeback kid but at the same time i also think it 's good for michael , " said ecclestone .
" when drivers have put in many years they sometimes lose focus and motivation – probably that was one of the reasons for his retirement in 2006 – but now he has again put all his strength together and has a 100 percent motivation level and that will give us many exciting races in 2010 .
forget about winning races – i have him on my bill for winning the championship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher was formula one world champion seven times and schumacher himself said he was confident of his abilities .
" obviously our only goal can be to fight for the world championship , " he told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
he said he has " no doubt " about his skills behind the wheel .
" i never stopped my physical training , " he said .
support from home schumacher can count on the full support of his wife of 14 years corinna .
" he knows exactly what he is doing and he knows that i am always behind him , " she said .
" he needs his challenges ; that 's just michael .
i understand it and i think it 's really great . "
she acknowledged that family life would be turned upside down , but said that when her husband told her of the call he had from his former and new team boss ross brawn " i immediately sensed that there was this fire burning inside him that i know so well . " schumacher had already tried to re-enter the sport this year , standing in for injured brazilian felipe massa for his former employer , ferrari .

" a series of trains have broken down because , as with the eurostar trains , dry powder snow is drawn through the ventilation grill into the train and can affect the electrical components , " he explained .
transport minister acknowledges problem travelers whose trains are delayed up to an hour will receive a 25 percent reduction of their fare while those who must wait two hours will be given 50 percent of their ticket price back .
passengers who are unable to complete their journey because their train has been cancelled will be reimbursed completely .
german transport minister peter ramsauer told daily sueddeutsche zeitung that for many passengers the timetable issues were " more than annoying .

the logic of the move has been questioned , but the fans are just happy to see their hero back . the appointment of michael schumacher is making waves – with some claiming that carmaker mercedes has got its business priorities wrong .
german racing fans , on the other hand , appear to be delighted and schumacher will be happy to know that – after three years in retirement – he even has the full support of his wife .
mercedes secured the services of the 40-year-old german on wednesday , in a one-year deal .
the seven time drivers ' champion is to earn around seven million euros -lrb- $ 10 million -rrb- .
the move drew criticism from the mercedes labor representatives in light of recession cost-cutting measures by brand owner daimler .
" it 's hard to put across to people , " the chairman of mercedes ' bremen works council , uwe werner , told the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions have expressed criticism about the timing of the move " the daimler board decrees , on the one hand , harsh austerity measures for the workforce , and has shifted some production to facilities in other countries .
on the other hand it spends tens of millions on formula one .
it is incomprehensible to many workers . "
werner added that the company 's cost cutting measures would have received more support if mercedes had pulled out of formula one altogether .
deal " will sell cars " the head of mercedes motor sports , norbert haug , disagrees .
he said that the company would make money as a result of formula one and , in particular , signing the star driver .
" the whole issue will sell many cars and the caliber of the star will make a lot of people sit up and pay attention , " said haug .
the investment will not pay off for the company according to ferdinand dudenhoeffer , an economics professor at the university of duisburg-essen who specializes in the car industry .
he questions whether customers will buy a mercedes based on the fact that the brand had a formula one presence .
" you can hardly comprehend it . they will have to charge about 200 to 300 euros more for every car sold , to finance the formula one campaign for mercedes .
mercedes is a company for which sportiness is not the main selling point , it is instead based on safety and on quality on the road . "
rush on race tickets despite this , many german fans are euphoric at the news – with a rush on tickets for the race at hockenheim next july .
formula one supremo bernie ecclestone hailed the news as " fantastic " and predicted a " jaw-dropping season . "
" i think it is fantastic for formula one that he turned into a comeback kid but at the same time i also think it 's good for michael , " said ecclestone .
" when drivers have put in many years they sometimes lose focus and motivation – probably that was one of the reasons for his retirement in 2006 – but now he has again put all his strength together and has a 100 percent motivation level and that will give us many exciting races in 2010 .
forget about winning races – i have him on my bill for winning the championship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher was formula one world champion seven times and schumacher himself said he was confident of his abilities .
" obviously our only goal can be to fight for the world championship , " he told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
he said he has " no doubt " about his skills behind the wheel .
" i never stopped my physical training , " he said .
support from home schumacher can count on the full support of his wife of 14 years corinna .
" he knows exactly what he is doing and he knows that i am always behind him , " she said .
" he needs his challenges ; that 's just michael .
i understand it and i think it 's really great . "
she acknowledged that family life would be turned upside down , but said that when her husband told her of the call he had from his former and new team boss ross brawn " i immediately sensed that there was this fire burning inside him that i know so well . " schumacher had already tried to re-enter the sport this year , standing in for injured brazilian felipe massa for his former employer , ferrari .
but a motorcycle neck injury , from which schumacher says he has recovered , cut short any comeback attempt. rc / sid / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those detained on the grounds of links with a militant group included local mayors . anti-terrorism squads in turkey conducted raids in 11 cities , arresting 43 campaigners and members of the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , said aides of the chief state prosecutor in the south-eastern city of diyarbakir .
among those arrested in the early-morning operation were several prominent politicians , including at least seven local mayors , and two-human rights activists .
according to some accounts from kurdish sources , the number arrested was between 60 and 80 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was unrest when the dtp was banned early in december turkey 's constitutional court banned the dtp on december 11 on the grounds of links with the kurdistan workers ' party , known as the pkk .
the pkk is a separatist militant group , which is regarded by the european union as a terrorist organization .
among those held in diyarbakir was a lawyer for the jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan .
raids across country the raids took place in cities across the southeast of the country as well as in istanbul and the capital , ankara .
the ban on the dtp , which led to days of unrest in kurdish areas of turkey , was opposed by prime minister tayyip erdogan .
erdogan had been trying to resolve a conflict that has cost around 40,000 lives over the past 25 years .
kurds make up about 20 percent of turkey 's 71 million population , and were forbidden from using their language for decades . following the raids , around 1,000 people gathered outside the diyarbakir office of the peace and democratic party -lrb- bdp -rrb- , which also represents kurds .
warning to government city mayor osman baydemir spoke to the crowd and warned the national government that , if the detentions continued , it would have no-one to negotiate with .
" if this process of purges continues , i state it very obviously : a day will come when you will find no-one to shake hands with , " said baydemir .
the european commission has condemned the banning of the dtp , while also criticizing the party for retaining links with the pkk .
turkey is involved in negotiations to join the european union but has been criticized for its human rights record .

this comes after much international criticism over the bill . in its current form , the bill proposes life imprisonment and even the death penalty for gays and lesbians in uganda .
museveni 's top aide said on thursday that the president was planning to intervene to address the concerns of uganda 's western partners who have expressed strong opposition to the bill .
" we should not have an extreme position .
the president will harmonize the two sides and address the concerns of the europeans and our other development partners . " said museveni 's spokesman .
international condemnation the bill , which is yet to be debated in uganda 's parliament , would have gay men and lesbians sentenced to life in prison for having sex .
in cases of sex with minors or sexual acts leading to hiv infection , the penalty would be death .
the bill also proposes that anyone who fails to report a homosexual act committed by others would face up to three years in jail .
international reaction to the bill has been widespread condemnation , with some western states threatening to withdraw aid to uganda if the government passes the bill into law .
there has also been outcry from the country 's small gay and lesbian community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : church groups worldwide have condemned the bill the world council of churches -lrb- wcc -rrb- has also criticized the bill , saying it would run against basic christian teaching by promoting hatred .
" from the experience of many nations , it is very clear that if such a bill is enacted into law , it will leave a lot of room for manipulation , abuse , blackmail and oppression of people " said wcc chief samuel kobia .
a top anglican cleric of ugandan decent in the uk , archbishop of york john sentamu , said he was " totally opposed to the death sentence " and found the language being used to describe homosexuals " upsetting " .
uganda denies bowing to the west uganda 's ethics and integrity minister nsaba buturo said the revised law would most likely make life in prison the maximum penalty for offenders .
" there have been a lot of discussions in government regarding the proposed law , but we now think a life sentence could be better because it gives room for offenders to be rehabilitated , " he said .
" killing them might not be helpful , " he added .

georgian-russian relations have been strained since a short war fought last year . ties between russia and georgia appeared to be improving on thursday after a swiss-brokered deal resulted in a plan to reopen a mountain pass on the border .
all border crossings and flights between the two nations have been closed since the august war fought in 2008 .
" according to our preliminary verbal agreement with the russian side , the verkhny lars checkpoint will open in early march , " georgian deputy foreign minister nino kalandadze told a news conference .
georgia and russia fought a brief war last year over the georgian breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
opening up the border would be the first sign of thaw in diplomatic ties between russia and georgia which were severed after the war .
the russian border service also released a statement citing the " shared need to resume international traffic between georgia and russia . "
all is not forgiven moscow has repeatedly asserted , however , that it would not resume official relations with georgia as long as president mikheil saakashvili remains in power .
kalandadze said the agreement would allow georgian citizens and cargo to cross the border and that a formal protocol on reopening the crossing would be finalized within two weeks .
on tuesday , georgian airlines airzena asked the russian government to allow it to run charter flights between tbilisi and moscow during the winter holiday period .
approximately one million georgians live in russia .
" we assess the resumption of air links positively .
we hope that negotiations between private air companies on resumption of flights will result in a positive decision , " kalandadze said. sjt / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

georgian-russian relations have been strained since a short war fought last year . ties between russia and georgia appeared to be improving on thursday after a swiss-brokered deal resulted in a plan to reopen a mountain pass on the border .
all border crossings and flights between the two nations have been closed since the august war fought in 2008 .
" according to our preliminary verbal agreement with the russian side , the verkhny lars checkpoint will open in early march , " georgian deputy foreign minister nino kalandadze told a news conference .
georgia and russia fought a brief war last year over the georgian breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia .
opening up the border would be the first sign of thaw in diplomatic ties between russia and georgia which were severed after the war .
the russian border service also released a statement citing the " shared need to resume international traffic between georgia and russia . "
all is not forgiven moscow has repeatedly asserted , however , that it would not resume official relations with georgia as long as president mikheil saakashvili remains in power .
kalandadze said the agreement would allow georgian citizens and cargo to cross the border and that a formal protocol on reopening the crossing would be finalized within two weeks .
on tuesday , georgian airlines airzena asked the russian government to allow it to run charter flights between tbilisi and moscow during the winter holiday period .
approximately one million georgians live in russia .
" we assess the resumption of air links positively .
we hope that negotiations between private air companies on resumption of flights will result in a positive decision , " kalandadze said. sjt / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new german study of organic and ethical fashion shows the growing industry is n't all it 's cracked up to be - especially when it comes to verifying adherence to " green " standards . recent years have seen a boom in the the organic , socially conscious textile industry .
small ethical t-shirt companies are shooting up left and right , and even big producers like hennes & mauritz have jumped on the bandwagon , making a line of organic cotton clothes .
in light of this , the german non-profit organization suedwind tested these companies to see if they delivered what they advertised - and to what extent .
questionnaires were sent out to 240 companies whose ecologically or socially conscious products can be ordered online in germany .
just 23 companies - 17 of them german - responded .
verification is an issue suedwind said the aim of the study was to see how closely the companies complied with generally accepted industry standards for ethical production , such as widespread international labor organization conventions and fair-trade labelling rules , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fairtrade is one of several groups out to verify compliance " many companies call themselves green , or ethical or fair , " said dominic kloos , who ran the suedwind study .
" but are they really ethical or ecological ?
that 's what we wanted to find out . "
kloos acknowledged that the low rate of response meant the study shows " tendencies " rather than giving a full picture of the industry .
but overall , despite progress , he said the results showed that " many … complied with some of the most important standards , but not with all of them . "
seven ' green ' criteria the suedwind study examined seven criteria , from checking ecological standards -lrb- are all components certified organic ? -rrb- and social ones -lrb- does the company comply with the " clean clothes campaign " code of conduct throughout its entire production chain ? -rrb- .
it also looked at verification measures , transparency levels , raw materials sourcing , and the chemical content of the clothes , among others .
" the main outcome is that ecological standards are easier to verify than social ones , " kloos said .
while environmental standards can be verified by certification agencies , social standards can only be upheld if a company is a member of a so-called multi-stakeholder initiative , or if they are a cooperative , " which means the work standards are in the workers ' hands , " kloos said .
overall , the study showed that 69 percent of the companies said they fulfilled basic social conventions , while 22 percent in accordance with listed ecological standards .
of those , 35 percent had external verification procedures for ecological standards - but only four of the 23 companies said they externally verified social standards .
raising the bar kloos acknowledged that his job is to " raise the bar very high " when shining a light on company behaviors .
but the fact that eco-clothing companies exist at all is a good sign for the future of the textile industry : " it 's great that these niche companies exist - they put pressure on the market , so that bigger companies , like h & m , come out with organic clothing , " he said .
ultimately , though , we do n't need to improve social and ecological standards on a voluntary basis , kloos said .
" what we need is legally binding rules . "

verification is an issue suedwind said the aim of the study was to see how closely the companies complied with generally accepted industry standards for ethical production , such as widespread international labor organization conventions and fair-trade labelling rules , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fairtrade is one of several groups out to verify compliance " many companies call themselves green , or ethical or fair , " said dominic kloos , who ran the suedwind study .
" but are they really ethical or ecological ?
that 's what we wanted to find out . "
kloos acknowledged that the low rate of response meant the study shows " tendencies " rather than giving a full picture of the industry .
but overall , despite progress , he said the results showed that " many … complied with some of the most important standards , but not with all of them . "
seven ' green ' criteria the suedwind study examined seven criteria , from checking ecological standards -lrb- are all components certified organic ? -rrb- and social ones -lrb- does the company comply with the " clean clothes campaign " code of conduct throughout its entire production chain ? -rrb- .
it also looked at verification measures , transparency levels , raw materials sourcing , and the chemical content of the clothes , among others .
" the main outcome is that ecological standards are easier to verify than social ones , " kloos said .
while environmental standards can be verified by certification agencies , social standards can only be upheld if a company is a member of a so-called multi-stakeholder initiative , or if they are a cooperative , " which means the work standards are in the workers ' hands , " kloos said .
overall , the study showed that 69 percent of the companies said they fulfilled basic social conventions , while 22 percent in accordance with listed ecological standards .
of those , 35 percent had external verification procedures for ecological standards - but only four of the 23 companies said they externally verified social standards .
raising the bar kloos acknowledged that his job is to " raise the bar very high " when shining a light on company behaviors .
but the fact that eco-clothing companies exist at all is a good sign for the future of the textile industry : " it 's great that these niche companies exist - they put pressure on the market , so that bigger companies , like h & m , come out with organic clothing , " he said .
ultimately , though , we do n't need to improve social and ecological standards on a voluntary basis , kloos said .
" what we need is legally binding rules . "

a new german study of organic and ethical fashion shows the growing industry is n't all it 's cracked up to be - especially when it comes to verifying adherence to " green " standards . recent years have seen a boom in the the organic , socially conscious textile industry .
small ethical t-shirt companies are shooting up left and right , and even big producers like hennes & mauritz have jumped on the bandwagon , making a line of organic cotton clothes .
in light of this , the german non-profit organization suedwind tested these companies to see if they delivered what they advertised - and to what extent .

images of the holy family , stars and religious songs were manipulated to take the " christ " out of christmas . christmas is a high point in the religious calendar for germans .
many of the traditions , images and songs enjoyed around the world have their roots in the christmas celebrations of german speaking countries .
sparkling stars on the tree , a fair-haired and angelic baby , brightly-wrapped presents and joyful carols sung by church choirs are all parts of the celebrations on dec .
24 , the day marking the birth of jesus christ . between 1933 and 1945 , under the third reich , christmas was just as popular as it is today .
but honoring the birth of a jewish baby - who was celebrated as the christian savior - was difficult for nazis to embrace .
as a result , national socialist ideologues decided to remove christian symbolism from the celebration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis aimed to take the jewish baby , jesus , out of christmas " celebrating the birth of a jewish baby was unthinkable for the nazis , " said juergen mueller , the chief researcher behind the exhibit " not such a holy night " at the national socialism documentation center in cologne , which documents christmas tradition during the third reich . but christmas was too popular even during the nazi period to be banned , mueller told deutsche welle . " they therefore decided to corrupt it . " initially nazi officials had tried to reject all christian traditions .
they renamed the festival julfest and propagated the germanic origins of the winter celebration of light on december 21 , the winter solstice . but for the majority of germans , the christian traditions were still the basis of the holiday . mueller said nazi officials then took inspiration from classical images showing a baby jesus with his loving parents , mary and joseph .
they reinterpreted this as a model aryan family , an image which the nazis had elevated to the highest levels during the late 1930s .
so for the nazis , the family rather than jesus became the center of the christmas celebrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the nazis , grenade- shaped ornaments replaced stars churches in germany , although outraged by the nazis ' fervent efforts to undermine beliefs central to christianity , were powerless to protest what was happening . " the reaction of the church was not very strong .
at about 1936-1937 , the nazi government was so powerful that the possibility of protest was extremely low , " mueller said .
" the church could n't really condemn it or protest against it , although it stuck to the christian traditions within itself , " he added . nazi christmas tree decorations no aspect of the christmas celebrations was free of nazi symbolism .
the tree , which has long been a central component of german christmas festivities , was stripped of its traditional decorations .
stars , angels , bells , fruit and candy were replaced with swastikas and ornaments shaped like miniature cannons , grenades and fighter planes .
at the top of the tree , instead of a star or angel , firm adherents to the nazi doctrine placed a soaring golden eagle , the german national symbol .
parents wrapped their children 's presents in brightly colored paper with nazi symbols . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandizing christmas in germany dates back to wwi the most difficult of images for the nazis to undermine was the star .
a six-pointed christmas star was too similar to the yellow star the jews were required to wear ; and a five-pointed star resembled the red star of the soviets .
as a result , the nazis banned stars completely from christmas tree decorations .
geometric shapes embossed with swastikas or germanic symbols were used instead . popular christmas carols were also rendered christianity-free by nazi composers .
barbara kirschbaum , one of the staff members at the ns documentation center , told deutsche welle : " the nazis tried to ban some of the christmas carols with open christian content . " " some of the songs got new lyrics , some were completely recreated , " she said . " hohe nacht der klaren sterne " -lrb- " high night of bright stars " -rrb- is one of the songs newly created by the nazis .
one transformed song , " es ist fuer uns eine zeit angekommen " -lrb- " the time has come for us " -rrb- , is still popular in the nazi version .
people sing it even in churches , not being aware of the history of the lyrics , " kirschbaum said . public reaction for kirschbaum , the purpose of the exhibition is to discover what can be learned from the way the nazis manipulated christmas imagery .
she said people need to understand that history is shaped by people , and that propaganda is used to rewrite history .
when the visitors see this in the exhibit , it will increase their awareness of what happened under the nazis , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas wreath redone in nazi style " older visitors at first are usually touched by their childhood memories , which are reawakened by the objects .
but slowly they see the purpose behind the things , something they often did n't realize when they were young .
and this frightens them , to see how things were used and how their beliefs as children were used for propaganda purposes , " said kirschbaum . angelika wasserburger , a 51-year-old visitor to the exhibition from nuremberg , found the reality very uncomfortable . " i think it 's very frightening to realize how many of our traditions , how many of our symbols , have this origin which we do n't realize anymore .
and it 's very frightening also to realize the misuse that has been implemented with those symbols and traditions , " she told deutsche welle . the reaction of younger visitors to the exhibition is even stronger . jonas rahimi , a 15-year-old who came to the exhibition on a school trip , was shocked by how deeply nazism left its imprint on christmas celebrations in germany . " the nazis really involved their radical views in every part of life .
there was even a little war game for kids .
it 's very shocking to me , " he said . " i think it 's very important that the people here in cologne remember what happened here because it was very crucial and you should not forget it , " he added . author : faith thomas editor : kristin zeier / jen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

images of the holy family , stars and religious songs were manipulated to take the " christ " out of christmas . christmas is a high point in the religious calendar for germans .
many of the traditions , images and songs enjoyed around the world have their roots in the christmas celebrations of german speaking countries .
sparkling stars on the tree , a fair-haired and angelic baby , brightly-wrapped presents and joyful carols sung by church choirs are all parts of the celebrations on dec .
24 , the day marking the birth of jesus christ . between 1933 and 1945 , under the third reich , christmas was just as popular as it is today .
but honoring the birth of a jewish baby - who was celebrated as the christian savior - was difficult for nazis to embrace .
as a result , national socialist ideologues decided to remove christian symbolism from the celebration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis aimed to take the jewish baby , jesus , out of christmas " celebrating the birth of a jewish baby was unthinkable for the nazis , " said juergen mueller , the chief researcher behind the exhibit " not such a holy night " at the national socialism documentation center in cologne , which documents christmas tradition during the third reich . but christmas was too popular even during the nazi period to be banned , mueller told deutsche welle . " they therefore decided to corrupt it . " initially nazi officials had tried to reject all christian traditions .
they renamed the festival julfest and propagated the germanic origins of the winter celebration of light on december 21 , the winter solstice . but for the majority of germans , the christian traditions were still the basis of the holiday . mueller said nazi officials then took inspiration from classical images showing a baby jesus with his loving parents , mary and joseph .
they reinterpreted this as a model aryan family , an image which the nazis had elevated to the highest levels during the late 1930s .
so for the nazis , the family rather than jesus became the center of the christmas celebrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the nazis , grenade- shaped ornaments replaced stars churches in germany , although outraged by the nazis ' fervent efforts to undermine beliefs central to christianity , were powerless to protest what was happening . " the reaction of the church was not very strong .
at about 1936-1937 , the nazi government was so powerful that the possibility of protest was extremely low , " mueller said .
" the church could n't really condemn it or protest against it , although it stuck to the christian traditions within itself , " he added . nazi christmas tree decorations no aspect of the christmas celebrations was free of nazi symbolism .
the tree , which has long been a central component of german christmas festivities , was stripped of its traditional decorations .
stars , angels , bells , fruit and candy were replaced with swastikas and ornaments shaped like miniature cannons , grenades and fighter planes .
at the top of the tree , instead of a star or angel , firm adherents to the nazi doctrine placed a soaring golden eagle , the german national symbol .
parents wrapped their children 's presents in brightly colored paper with nazi symbols . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandizing christmas in germany dates back to wwi the most difficult of images for the nazis to undermine was the star .
a six-pointed christmas star was too similar to the yellow star the jews were required to wear ; and a five-pointed star resembled the red star of the soviets .
as a result , the nazis banned stars completely from christmas tree decorations .
geometric shapes embossed with swastikas or germanic symbols were used instead . popular christmas carols were also rendered christianity-free by nazi composers .
barbara kirschbaum , one of the staff members at the ns documentation center , told deutsche welle : " the nazis tried to ban some of the christmas carols with open christian content . " " some of the songs got new lyrics , some were completely recreated , " she said . " hohe nacht der klaren sterne " -lrb- " high night of bright stars " -rrb- is one of the songs newly created by the nazis .
one transformed song , " es ist fuer uns eine zeit angekommen " -lrb- " the time has come for us " -rrb- , is still popular in the nazi version .
people sing it even in churches , not being aware of the history of the lyrics , " kirschbaum said . public reaction for kirschbaum , the purpose of the exhibition is to discover what can be learned from the way the nazis manipulated christmas imagery .
she said people need to understand that history is shaped by people , and that propaganda is used to rewrite history .
when the visitors see this in the exhibit , it will increase their awareness of what happened under the nazis , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas wreath redone in nazi style " older visitors at first are usually touched by their childhood memories , which are reawakened by the objects .

images of the holy family , stars and religious songs were manipulated to take the " christ " out of christmas . christmas is a high point in the religious calendar for germans .
many of the traditions , images and songs enjoyed around the world have their roots in the christmas celebrations of german speaking countries .
sparkling stars on the tree , a fair-haired and angelic baby , brightly-wrapped presents and joyful carols sung by church choirs are all parts of the celebrations on dec .
24 , the day marking the birth of jesus christ . between 1933 and 1945 , under the third reich , christmas was just as popular as it is today .
but honoring the birth of a jewish baby - who was celebrated as the christian savior - was difficult for nazis to embrace .
as a result , national socialist ideologues decided to remove christian symbolism from the celebration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis aimed to take the jewish baby , jesus , out of christmas " celebrating the birth of a jewish baby was unthinkable for the nazis , " said juergen mueller , the chief researcher behind the exhibit " not such a holy night " at the national socialism documentation center in cologne , which documents christmas tradition during the third reich . but christmas was too popular even during the nazi period to be banned , mueller told deutsche welle . " they therefore decided to corrupt it . " initially nazi officials had tried to reject all christian traditions .
they renamed the festival julfest and propagated the germanic origins of the winter celebration of light on december 21 , the winter solstice . but for the majority of germans , the christian traditions were still the basis of the holiday . mueller said nazi officials then took inspiration from classical images showing a baby jesus with his loving parents , mary and joseph .
they reinterpreted this as a model aryan family , an image which the nazis had elevated to the highest levels during the late 1930s .
so for the nazis , the family rather than jesus became the center of the christmas celebrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the nazis , grenade- shaped ornaments replaced stars churches in germany , although outraged by the nazis ' fervent efforts to undermine beliefs central to christianity , were powerless to protest what was happening . " the reaction of the church was not very strong .
at about 1936-1937 , the nazi government was so powerful that the possibility of protest was extremely low , " mueller said .
" the church could n't really condemn it or protest against it , although it stuck to the christian traditions within itself , " he added . nazi christmas tree decorations no aspect of the christmas celebrations was free of nazi symbolism .
the tree , which has long been a central component of german christmas festivities , was stripped of its traditional decorations .
stars , angels , bells , fruit and candy were replaced with swastikas and ornaments shaped like miniature cannons , grenades and fighter planes .
at the top of the tree , instead of a star or angel , firm adherents to the nazi doctrine placed a soaring golden eagle , the german national symbol .
parents wrapped their children 's presents in brightly colored paper with nazi symbols . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandizing christmas in germany dates back to wwi the most difficult of images for the nazis to undermine was the star .
a six-pointed christmas star was too similar to the yellow star the jews were required to wear ; and a five-pointed star resembled the red star of the soviets .
as a result , the nazis banned stars completely from christmas tree decorations .
geometric shapes embossed with swastikas or germanic symbols were used instead . popular christmas carols were also rendered christianity-free by nazi composers .
barbara kirschbaum , one of the staff members at the ns documentation center , told deutsche welle : " the nazis tried to ban some of the christmas carols with open christian content . " " some of the songs got new lyrics , some were completely recreated , " she said . " hohe nacht der klaren sterne " -lrb- " high night of bright stars " -rrb- is one of the songs newly created by the nazis .
one transformed song , " es ist fuer uns eine zeit angekommen " -lrb- " the time has come for us " -rrb- , is still popular in the nazi version .
people sing it even in churches , not being aware of the history of the lyrics , " kirschbaum said . public reaction for kirschbaum , the purpose of the exhibition is to discover what can be learned from the way the nazis manipulated christmas imagery .
she said people need to understand that history is shaped by people , and that propaganda is used to rewrite history .
when the visitors see this in the exhibit , it will increase their awareness of what happened under the nazis , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas wreath redone in nazi style " older visitors at first are usually touched by their childhood memories , which are reawakened by the objects .
but slowly they see the purpose behind the things , something they often did n't realize when they were young .
and this frightens them , to see how things were used and how their beliefs as children were used for propaganda purposes , " said kirschbaum . angelika wasserburger , a 51-year-old visitor to the exhibition from nuremberg , found the reality very uncomfortable . " i think it 's very frightening to realize how many of our traditions , how many of our symbols , have this origin which we do n't realize anymore .
and it 's very frightening also to realize the misuse that has been implemented with those symbols and traditions , " she told deutsche welle . the reaction of younger visitors to the exhibition is even stronger . jonas rahimi , a 15-year-old who came to the exhibition on a school trip , was shocked by how deeply nazism left its imprint on christmas celebrations in germany . " the nazis really involved their radical views in every part of life .
there was even a little war game for kids .
it 's very shocking to me , " he said . " i think it 's very important that the people here in cologne remember what happened here because it was very crucial and you should not forget it , " he added . author : faith thomas editor : kristin zeier / jen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 2009 , beijing ’ s tiananmen square was transformed into a stage to celebrate the founding of the people ’ s republic of china 60 years ago .
there was a large military parade to demonstrate china 's military might .
despite the country 's economic strengths , it still has far to go in terms of human rights . president hu jintao opened the 60th anniversary ceremony to firing canons , wearing a suit like mao zedong 's .
a two-hour parade , which included tanks and missiles , 8,000 soldiers , 60 floats and 100,000 well trained civilians symbolised the country ’ s growing military and economic might .
but there was much criticism of china on the occasion .
in hong kong , for example , there were massive demonstrations against the lack of progress on human rights and democracy .
earlier on in 2009 , on the 50th anniversary of the failed tibetan uprising in march , people all over the world demonstrated for tibet ’ s autonomy .
after 50 years in exile , the dalai lama has not given up the fight .
“ the problem with the people ’ s republic of china is that they consider me a trouble maker , ” he said this year .
“ so it is my duty to create more trouble . ”
trouble in xinjiang there was also “ trouble ” in china 's north-western region of xinjiang , where the uighurs and majority han chinese clashed in july , causing some 200 deaths .
the mainly muslim uighurs complain - like many other minorities in china - of cultural and religious repression .
2009 also marked the 20th anniversary of the massacre on tiananmen square , which can arguably be considered the most potent symbol of chinese repression in the country ’ s recent past .
the chinese media were banned from discussing it .
the british human rights risk atlas ranked china 12th “ most risky country ” overall for human rights this year .
for child labour , forced labour , and violations of freedom of association , discrimination and working conditions , china ranked highest .
“ no transparency in china ” liu xiaobo is one of china 's most prominent dissidents and is currently awaiting sentencing on charges of subversion .
" i have lost faith , ” his wife liu xia said in august .
“ there is absolutely no transparency here .
if you live in a country in which freedom of speech isn ’ t worth a dime , anyone can be convicted . ”
“ i am very worried , ” she continued .
“ they have accused him of felonies , for which he could receive up to 15 years in prison .
he didn ’ t do anything , aside from telling the truth and stating his opinion .
here in china they call that ‘ breaking the law ’ . ”
liu xiaobo 's sentence is expected to be handed down on christmas day .
optimism about economic situation although china was criticised for its human rights record , its economic situation in 2009 gave rise to hope .
despite world recession , china ’ s economy continued to grow at a rate of eight to 10 percent .
the optimism expressed by many economists at the beginning of the year seems to have been vindicated .
“ the statistics are showing recovery in many sectors of the economy , ” the head of the chinese central bank , zhal xiaochuan , said in january .
“ this means that our economic stimulus programme is taking hold .
the chinese state council has made it clear that our reaction to the crisis must be quick and resolute . ”
the positive signs in china 's economy have been attributed to an increase in chinese consumerism and lending and investments abroad .
with this strategy , experts say china is leading the world out of the financial crisis and will continue to do so in 2010 .

1 2009 , beijing ’ s tiananmen square was transformed into a stage to celebrate the founding of the people ’ s republic of china 60 years ago .
there was a large military parade to demonstrate china 's military might .
despite the country 's economic strengths , it still has far to go in terms of human rights . president hu jintao opened the 60th anniversary ceremony to firing canons , wearing a suit like mao zedong 's .
a two-hour parade , which included tanks and missiles , 8,000 soldiers , 60 floats and 100,000 well trained civilians symbolised the country ’ s growing military and economic might .
but there was much criticism of china on the occasion .
in hong kong , for example , there were massive demonstrations against the lack of progress on human rights and democracy .
earlier on in 2009 , on the 50th anniversary of the failed tibetan uprising in march , people all over the world demonstrated for tibet ’ s autonomy .
after 50 years in exile , the dalai lama has not given up the fight .
“ the problem with the people ’ s republic of china is that they consider me a trouble maker , ” he said this year .
“ so it is my duty to create more trouble . ”
trouble in xinjiang there was also “ trouble ” in china 's north-western region of xinjiang , where the uighurs and majority han chinese clashed in july , causing some 200 deaths .
the mainly muslim uighurs complain - like many other minorities in china - of cultural and religious repression .
2009 also marked the 20th anniversary of the massacre on tiananmen square , which can arguably be considered the most potent symbol of chinese repression in the country ’ s recent past .
the chinese media were banned from discussing it .
the british human rights risk atlas ranked china 12th “ most risky country ” overall for human rights this year .
for child labour , forced labour , and violations of freedom of association , discrimination and working conditions , china ranked highest .
“ no transparency in china ” liu xiaobo is one of china 's most prominent dissidents and is currently awaiting sentencing on charges of subversion .
" i have lost faith , ” his wife liu xia said in august .
“ there is absolutely no transparency here .
if you live in a country in which freedom of speech isn ’ t worth a dime , anyone can be convicted . ”
“ i am very worried , ” she continued .
“ they have accused him of felonies , for which he could receive up to 15 years in prison .
he didn ’ t do anything , aside from telling the truth and stating his opinion .
here in china they call that ‘ breaking the law ’ . ”
liu xiaobo 's sentence is expected to be handed down on christmas day .
optimism about economic situation although china was criticised for its human rights record , its economic situation in 2009 gave rise to hope .
despite world recession , china ’ s economy continued to grow at a rate of eight to 10 percent .
the optimism expressed by many economists at the beginning of the year seems to have been vindicated .
“ the statistics are showing recovery in many sectors of the economy , ” the head of the chinese central bank , zhal xiaochuan , said in january .
“ this means that our economic stimulus programme is taking hold .
the chinese state council has made it clear that our reaction to the crisis must be quick and resolute . ”
the positive signs in china 's economy have been attributed to an increase in chinese consumerism and lending and investments abroad .
with this strategy , experts say china is leading the world out of the financial crisis and will continue to do so in 2010 .

despite the country 's economic strengths , it still has far to go in terms of human rights . president hu jintao opened the 60th anniversary ceremony to firing canons , wearing a suit like mao zedong 's .
a two-hour parade , which included tanks and missiles , 8,000 soldiers , 60 floats and 100,000 well trained civilians symbolised the country ’ s growing military and economic might .
but there was much criticism of china on the occasion .
in hong kong , for example , there were massive demonstrations against the lack of progress on human rights and democracy .
earlier on in 2009 , on the 50th anniversary of the failed tibetan uprising in march , people all over the world demonstrated for tibet ’ s autonomy .
after 50 years in exile , the dalai lama has not given up the fight .
“ the problem with the people ’ s republic of china is that they consider me a trouble maker , ” he said this year .
“ so it is my duty to create more trouble . ”
trouble in xinjiang there was also “ trouble ” in china 's north-western region of xinjiang , where the uighurs and majority han chinese clashed in july , causing some 200 deaths .
the mainly muslim uighurs complain - like many other minorities in china - of cultural and religious repression .
2009 also marked the 20th anniversary of the massacre on tiananmen square , which can arguably be considered the most potent symbol of chinese repression in the country ’ s recent past .
the chinese media were banned from discussing it .
the british human rights risk atlas ranked china 12th “ most risky country ” overall for human rights this year .
for child labour , forced labour , and violations of freedom of association , discrimination and working conditions , china ranked highest .
“ no transparency in china ” liu xiaobo is one of china 's most prominent dissidents and is currently awaiting sentencing on charges of subversion .
" i have lost faith , ” his wife liu xia said in august .
“ there is absolutely no transparency here .
if you live in a country in which freedom of speech isn ’ t worth a dime , anyone can be convicted . ”
“ i am very worried , ” she continued .
“ they have accused him of felonies , for which he could receive up to 15 years in prison .
he didn ’ t do anything , aside from telling the truth and stating his opinion .
here in china they call that ‘ breaking the law ’ . ”
liu xiaobo 's sentence is expected to be handed down on christmas day .
optimism about economic situation although china was criticised for its human rights record , its economic situation in 2009 gave rise to hope .
despite world recession , china ’ s economy continued to grow at a rate of eight to 10 percent .
the optimism expressed by many economists at the beginning of the year seems to have been vindicated .
“ the statistics are showing recovery in many sectors of the economy , ” the head of the chinese central bank , zhal xiaochuan , said in january .
“ this means that our economic stimulus programme is taking hold .
the chinese state council has made it clear that our reaction to the crisis must be quick and resolute . ”
the positive signs in china 's economy have been attributed to an increase in chinese consumerism and lending and investments abroad .
with this strategy , experts say china is leading the world out of the financial crisis and will continue to do so in 2010 .

the islands were particularly badly hit by the tsunami in 2004 and some 6,000 people lost their lives .
some inhabitants want to promote tourism to the islands but environmentalists fear this could have disastrous consequences for the tribes who still live there isolated from the rest of the world . crystal clear water reflecting the thousand colours of the sun .
a white sandy beach .
palm trees blowing in the wind .
radhanagar beach on havelock island is surely one of the most beautiful beaches in the world and the best thing is that there are hardly any tourists .
those who have found the place are enchanted .
25-year-old carsten schiller from hamburg thinks that " the andamans are the most beautiful place in india for relaxing and enjoying the sun . "
" the most important thing here is the diving , " says a finnish tourist .
" the islands are a bit out of the way and therefore there aren ’ t so many tourists .
everything is still and calm here . "
islands need to be promoted for tourism the former head of the andaman and nicobar chamber of trade and commerce , mohammad jadwed , thinks that the potential for tourism has to be exploited .
he owns a fleet of ships that he uses to transport tourists to the islands .
" i think that the tsunami is one of the most terrible historical events to ever hit the islands , ” he says .
" and yet the catastrophe also had a positive effect .
before , the andaman and nicobar islands were not to be found on any map of the world .
even many indians didn ’ t know where they were .
but since the tsunami people have been aware of us .
we have to make the most of this fact . "
tourism to the islands grew steadily until 2004 .
some 150,000 tourists would come from the indian mainland and abroad .
there were plans to build big luxury hotels .
but then the tsunami struck .
now the taj hotel chain is planning to build a massive resort .
and the government is reviewing a hundred million euro investment plan that includes the islands .
the number of flights from the indian mainland has already doubled .
there is also talk of opening the provincial capital port blair ’ s airport to international flights .
potential disaster for indigenous tribes environmentalist samir acharya thinks this would be disastrous for the tribes who live on the islands .
" of course we need tourism on these islands , " he says .
" but to misuse tourism is wrong .
and all this talk of eco-tourism is just fashionable .
today there is a lot of greenwashing . "
samir acharya is not only worried about the region ’ s biodiversity .
he also wants to know who the tourist boom is supposed to help .
the indian settlers or the indigenous population ?
he thinks that the jarawas , who live on a reserve , are particularly at threat .
shyami sodhi , who is in charge of the well-being of the tribes on the islands of andaman and nicobar , worries that the jarawas could lose their traditions .
" they live next to a big road .
their lifestyle and their culture are coming into contact with our lifestyle and our culture more and more .
we ’ re getting closer to another .
we have to be careful . "
six years ago , india ’ s supreme court ruled that the road should be closed down but this has not happened .
there are rumours that some tourists pay a lot of money to visit the jarawas .
they exchange photos for a biscuit or some other item of food that the jarawas do not know .
at the moment , these are only isolated incidents but observers worry that this paradise on earth could well disappear over the next few years .

images of the holy family , stars and religious songs were manipulated to take the " christ " out of christmas . christmas is a high point in the religious calendar for germans .
many of the traditions , images and songs enjoyed around the world have their roots in the christmas celebrations of german speaking countries .
sparkling stars on the tree , a fair-haired and angelic baby , brightly-wrapped presents and joyful carols sung by church choirs are all parts of the celebrations on dec .
24 , the day marking the birth of jesus christ . between 1933 and 1945 , under the third reich , christmas was just as popular as it is today .
but honoring the birth of a jewish baby - who was celebrated as the christian savior - was difficult for nazis to embrace .
as a result , national socialist ideologues decided to remove christian symbolism from the celebration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis aimed to take the jewish baby , jesus , out of christmas " celebrating the birth of a jewish baby was unthinkable for the nazis , " said juergen mueller , the chief researcher behind the exhibit " not such a holy night " at the national socialism documentation center in cologne , which documents christmas tradition during the third reich . but christmas was too popular even during the nazi period to be banned , mueller told deutsche welle . " they therefore decided to corrupt it . " initially nazi officials had tried to reject all christian traditions .
they renamed the festival julfest and propagated the germanic origins of the winter celebration of light on december 21 , the winter solstice . but for the majority of germans , the christian traditions were still the basis of the holiday . mueller said nazi officials then took inspiration from classical images showing a baby jesus with his loving parents , mary and joseph .
they reinterpreted this as a model aryan family , an image which the nazis had elevated to the highest levels during the late 1930s .
so for the nazis , the family rather than jesus became the center of the christmas celebrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the nazis , grenade- shaped ornaments replaced stars churches in germany , although outraged by the nazis ' fervent efforts to undermine beliefs central to christianity , were powerless to protest what was happening . " the reaction of the church was not very strong .
at about 1936-1937 , the nazi government was so powerful that the possibility of protest was extremely low , " mueller said .
" the church could n't really condemn it or protest against it , although it stuck to the christian traditions within itself , " he added . nazi christmas tree decorations no aspect of the christmas celebrations was free of nazi symbolism .
the tree , which has long been a central component of german christmas festivities , was stripped of its traditional decorations .
stars , angels , bells , fruit and candy were replaced with swastikas and ornaments shaped like miniature cannons , grenades and fighter planes .
at the top of the tree , instead of a star or angel , firm adherents to the nazi doctrine placed a soaring golden eagle , the german national symbol .
parents wrapped their children 's presents in brightly colored paper with nazi symbols . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandizing christmas in germany dates back to wwi the most difficult of images for the nazis to undermine was the star .
a six-pointed christmas star was too similar to the yellow star the jews were required to wear ; and a five-pointed star resembled the red star of the soviets .
as a result , the nazis banned stars completely from christmas tree decorations .
geometric shapes embossed with swastikas or germanic symbols were used instead . popular christmas carols were also rendered christianity-free by nazi composers .
barbara kirschbaum , one of the staff members at the ns documentation center , told deutsche welle : " the nazis tried to ban some of the christmas carols with open christian content . " " some of the songs got new lyrics , some were completely recreated , " she said . " hohe nacht der klaren sterne " -lrb- " high night of bright stars " -rrb- is one of the songs newly created by the nazis .
one transformed song , " es ist fuer uns eine zeit angekommen " -lrb- " the time has come for us " -rrb- , is still popular in the nazi version .
people sing it even in churches , not being aware of the history of the lyrics , " kirschbaum said . public reaction for kirschbaum , the purpose of the exhibition is to discover what can be learned from the way the nazis manipulated christmas imagery .
she said people need to understand that history is shaped by people , and that propaganda is used to rewrite history .
when the visitors see this in the exhibit , it will increase their awareness of what happened under the nazis , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas wreath redone in nazi style " older visitors at first are usually touched by their childhood memories , which are reawakened by the objects .
but slowly they see the purpose behind the things , something they often did n't realize when they were young .
and this frightens them , to see how things were used and how their beliefs as children were used for propaganda purposes , " said kirschbaum . angelika wasserburger , a 51-year-old visitor to the exhibition from nuremberg , found the reality very uncomfortable . " i think it 's very frightening to realize how many of our traditions , how many of our symbols , have this origin which we do n't realize anymore .
and it 's very frightening also to realize the misuse that has been implemented with those symbols and traditions , " she told deutsche welle . the reaction of younger visitors to the exhibition is even stronger . jonas rahimi , a 15-year-old who came to the exhibition on a school trip , was shocked by how deeply nazism left its imprint on christmas celebrations in germany . " the nazis really involved their radical views in every part of life .
there was even a little war game for kids .

they reinterpreted this as a model aryan family , an image which the nazis had elevated to the highest levels during the late 1930s .
so for the nazis , the family rather than jesus became the center of the christmas celebrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the nazis , grenade- shaped ornaments replaced stars churches in germany , although outraged by the nazis ' fervent efforts to undermine beliefs central to christianity , were powerless to protest what was happening . " the reaction of the church was not very strong .
at about 1936-1937 , the nazi government was so powerful that the possibility of protest was extremely low , " mueller said .
" the church could n't really condemn it or protest against it , although it stuck to the christian traditions within itself , " he added . nazi christmas tree decorations no aspect of the christmas celebrations was free of nazi symbolism .
the tree , which has long been a central component of german christmas festivities , was stripped of its traditional decorations .
stars , angels , bells , fruit and candy were replaced with swastikas and ornaments shaped like miniature cannons , grenades and fighter planes .
at the top of the tree , instead of a star or angel , firm adherents to the nazi doctrine placed a soaring golden eagle , the german national symbol .
parents wrapped their children 's presents in brightly colored paper with nazi symbols . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandizing christmas in germany dates back to wwi the most difficult of images for the nazis to undermine was the star .
a six-pointed christmas star was too similar to the yellow star the jews were required to wear ; and a five-pointed star resembled the red star of the soviets .
as a result , the nazis banned stars completely from christmas tree decorations .
geometric shapes embossed with swastikas or germanic symbols were used instead . popular christmas carols were also rendered christianity-free by nazi composers .
barbara kirschbaum , one of the staff members at the ns documentation center , told deutsche welle : " the nazis tried to ban some of the christmas carols with open christian content . " " some of the songs got new lyrics , some were completely recreated , " she said . " hohe nacht der klaren sterne " -lrb- " high night of bright stars " -rrb- is one of the songs newly created by the nazis .
one transformed song , " es ist fuer uns eine zeit angekommen " -lrb- " the time has come for us " -rrb- , is still popular in the nazi version .
people sing it even in churches , not being aware of the history of the lyrics , " kirschbaum said . public reaction for kirschbaum , the purpose of the exhibition is to discover what can be learned from the way the nazis manipulated christmas imagery .
she said people need to understand that history is shaped by people , and that propaganda is used to rewrite history .
when the visitors see this in the exhibit , it will increase their awareness of what happened under the nazis , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas wreath redone in nazi style " older visitors at first are usually touched by their childhood memories , which are reawakened by the objects .
but slowly they see the purpose behind the things , something they often did n't realize when they were young .
and this frightens them , to see how things were used and how their beliefs as children were used for propaganda purposes , " said kirschbaum . angelika wasserburger , a 51-year-old visitor to the exhibition from nuremberg , found the reality very uncomfortable . " i think it 's very frightening to realize how many of our traditions , how many of our symbols , have this origin which we do n't realize anymore .
and it 's very frightening also to realize the misuse that has been implemented with those symbols and traditions , " she told deutsche welle . the reaction of younger visitors to the exhibition is even stronger . jonas rahimi , a 15-year-old who came to the exhibition on a school trip , was shocked by how deeply nazism left its imprint on christmas celebrations in germany . " the nazis really involved their radical views in every part of life .
there was even a little war game for kids .

images of the holy family , stars and religious songs were manipulated to take the " christ " out of christmas . christmas is a high point in the religious calendar for germans .
many of the traditions , images and songs enjoyed around the world have their roots in the christmas celebrations of german speaking countries .
sparkling stars on the tree , a fair-haired and angelic baby , brightly-wrapped presents and joyful carols sung by church choirs are all parts of the celebrations on dec .

images of the holy family , stars and religious songs were manipulated to take the " christ " out of christmas . christmas is a high point in the religious calendar for germans .
many of the traditions , images and songs enjoyed around the world have their roots in the christmas celebrations of german speaking countries .
sparkling stars on the tree , a fair-haired and angelic baby , brightly-wrapped presents and joyful carols sung by church choirs are all parts of the celebrations on dec .
24 , the day marking the birth of jesus christ . between 1933 and 1945 , under the third reich , christmas was just as popular as it is today .
but honoring the birth of a jewish baby - who was celebrated as the christian savior - was difficult for nazis to embrace .
as a result , national socialist ideologues decided to remove christian symbolism from the celebration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis aimed to take the jewish baby , jesus , out of christmas " celebrating the birth of a jewish baby was unthinkable for the nazis , " said juergen mueller , the chief researcher behind the exhibit " not such a holy night " at the national socialism documentation center in cologne , which documents christmas tradition during the third reich . but christmas was too popular even during the nazi period to be banned , mueller told deutsche welle . " they therefore decided to corrupt it . " initially nazi officials had tried to reject all christian traditions .
they renamed the festival julfest and propagated the germanic origins of the winter celebration of light on december 21 , the winter solstice . but for the majority of germans , the christian traditions were still the basis of the holiday . mueller said nazi officials then took inspiration from classical images showing a baby jesus with his loving parents , mary and joseph .
they reinterpreted this as a model aryan family , an image which the nazis had elevated to the highest levels during the late 1930s .
so for the nazis , the family rather than jesus became the center of the christmas celebrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the nazis , grenade- shaped ornaments replaced stars churches in germany , although outraged by the nazis ' fervent efforts to undermine beliefs central to christianity , were powerless to protest what was happening . " the reaction of the church was not very strong .
at about 1936-1937 , the nazi government was so powerful that the possibility of protest was extremely low , " mueller said .
" the church could n't really condemn it or protest against it , although it stuck to the christian traditions within itself , " he added . nazi christmas tree decorations no aspect of the christmas celebrations was free of nazi symbolism .
the tree , which has long been a central component of german christmas festivities , was stripped of its traditional decorations .
stars , angels , bells , fruit and candy were replaced with swastikas and ornaments shaped like miniature cannons , grenades and fighter planes .
at the top of the tree , instead of a star or angel , firm adherents to the nazi doctrine placed a soaring golden eagle , the german national symbol .
parents wrapped their children 's presents in brightly colored paper with nazi symbols . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandizing christmas in germany dates back to wwi the most difficult of images for the nazis to undermine was the star .
a six-pointed christmas star was too similar to the yellow star the jews were required to wear ; and a five-pointed star resembled the red star of the soviets .
as a result , the nazis banned stars completely from christmas tree decorations .
geometric shapes embossed with swastikas or germanic symbols were used instead . popular christmas carols were also rendered christianity-free by nazi composers .
barbara kirschbaum , one of the staff members at the ns documentation center , told deutsche welle : " the nazis tried to ban some of the christmas carols with open christian content . " " some of the songs got new lyrics , some were completely recreated , " she said . " hohe nacht der klaren sterne " -lrb- " high night of bright stars " -rrb- is one of the songs newly created by the nazis .
one transformed song , " es ist fuer uns eine zeit angekommen " -lrb- " the time has come for us " -rrb- , is still popular in the nazi version .
people sing it even in churches , not being aware of the history of the lyrics , " kirschbaum said . public reaction for kirschbaum , the purpose of the exhibition is to discover what can be learned from the way the nazis manipulated christmas imagery .
she said people need to understand that history is shaped by people , and that propaganda is used to rewrite history .
when the visitors see this in the exhibit , it will increase their awareness of what happened under the nazis , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas wreath redone in nazi style " older visitors at first are usually touched by their childhood memories , which are reawakened by the objects .
but slowly they see the purpose behind the things , something they often did n't realize when they were young .
and this frightens them , to see how things were used and how their beliefs as children were used for propaganda purposes , " said kirschbaum . angelika wasserburger , a 51-year-old visitor to the exhibition from nuremberg , found the reality very uncomfortable . " i think it 's very frightening to realize how many of our traditions , how many of our symbols , have this origin which we do n't realize anymore .
and it 's very frightening also to realize the misuse that has been implemented with those symbols and traditions , " she told deutsche welle . the reaction of younger visitors to the exhibition is even stronger . jonas rahimi , a 15-year-old who came to the exhibition on a school trip , was shocked by how deeply nazism left its imprint on christmas celebrations in germany . " the nazis really involved their radical views in every part of life .
there was even a little war game for kids .

1 2009 , beijing ’ s tiananmen square was transformed into a stage to celebrate the founding of the people ’ s republic of china 60 years ago .
there was a large military parade to demonstrate china 's military might .
despite the country 's economic strengths , it still has far to go in terms of human rights . president hu jintao opened the 60th anniversary ceremony to firing canons , wearing a suit like mao zedong 's .
a two-hour parade , which included tanks and missiles , 8,000 soldiers , 60 floats and 100,000 well trained civilians symbolised the country ’ s growing military and economic might .
but there was much criticism of china on the occasion .
in hong kong , for example , there were massive demonstrations against the lack of progress on human rights and democracy .
earlier on in 2009 , on the 50th anniversary of the failed tibetan uprising in march , people all over the world demonstrated for tibet ’ s autonomy .
after 50 years in exile , the dalai lama has not given up the fight .
“ the problem with the people ’ s republic of china is that they consider me a trouble maker , ” he said this year .
“ so it is my duty to create more trouble . ”
trouble in xinjiang there was also “ trouble ” in china 's north-western region of xinjiang , where the uighurs and majority han chinese clashed in july , causing some 200 deaths .
the mainly muslim uighurs complain - like many other minorities in china - of cultural and religious repression .
2009 also marked the 20th anniversary of the massacre on tiananmen square , which can arguably be considered the most potent symbol of chinese repression in the country ’ s recent past .
the chinese media were banned from discussing it .
the british human rights risk atlas ranked china 12th “ most risky country ” overall for human rights this year .
for child labour , forced labour , and violations of freedom of association , discrimination and working conditions , china ranked highest .
“ no transparency in china ” liu xiaobo is one of china 's most prominent dissidents and is currently awaiting sentencing on charges of subversion .
" i have lost faith , ” his wife liu xia said in august .
“ there is absolutely no transparency here .
if you live in a country in which freedom of speech isn ’ t worth a dime , anyone can be convicted . ”
“ i am very worried , ” she continued .
“ they have accused him of felonies , for which he could receive up to 15 years in prison .
he didn ’ t do anything , aside from telling the truth and stating his opinion .
here in china they call that ‘ breaking the law ’ . ”
liu xiaobo 's sentence is expected to be handed down on christmas day .
optimism about economic situation although china was criticised for its human rights record , its economic situation in 2009 gave rise to hope .
despite world recession , china ’ s economy continued to grow at a rate of eight to 10 percent .
the optimism expressed by many economists at the beginning of the year seems to have been vindicated .
“ the statistics are showing recovery in many sectors of the economy , ” the head of the chinese central bank , zhal xiaochuan , said in january .
“ this means that our economic stimulus programme is taking hold .
the chinese state council has made it clear that our reaction to the crisis must be quick and resolute . ”
the positive signs in china 's economy have been attributed to an increase in chinese consumerism and lending and investments abroad .
with this strategy , experts say china is leading the world out of the financial crisis and will continue to do so in 2010 .

the islands were particularly badly hit by the tsunami in 2004 and some 6,000 people lost their lives .
some inhabitants want to promote tourism to the islands but environmentalists fear this could have disastrous consequences for the tribes who still live there isolated from the rest of the world . crystal clear water reflecting the thousand colours of the sun .
a white sandy beach .
palm trees blowing in the wind .
radhanagar beach on havelock island is surely one of the most beautiful beaches in the world and the best thing is that there are hardly any tourists .
those who have found the place are enchanted .
25-year-old carsten schiller from hamburg thinks that " the andamans are the most beautiful place in india for relaxing and enjoying the sun . "
" the most important thing here is the diving , " says a finnish tourist .
" the islands are a bit out of the way and therefore there aren ’ t so many tourists .
everything is still and calm here . "
islands need to be promoted for tourism the former head of the andaman and nicobar chamber of trade and commerce , mohammad jadwed , thinks that the potential for tourism has to be exploited .
he owns a fleet of ships that he uses to transport tourists to the islands .
" i think that the tsunami is one of the most terrible historical events to ever hit the islands , ” he says .
" and yet the catastrophe also had a positive effect .
before , the andaman and nicobar islands were not to be found on any map of the world .
even many indians didn ’ t know where they were .
but since the tsunami people have been aware of us .
we have to make the most of this fact . "
tourism to the islands grew steadily until 2004 .
some 150,000 tourists would come from the indian mainland and abroad .
there were plans to build big luxury hotels .
but then the tsunami struck .
now the taj hotel chain is planning to build a massive resort .
and the government is reviewing a hundred million euro investment plan that includes the islands .
the number of flights from the indian mainland has already doubled .
there is also talk of opening the provincial capital port blair ’ s airport to international flights .
potential disaster for indigenous tribes environmentalist samir acharya thinks this would be disastrous for the tribes who live on the islands .
" of course we need tourism on these islands , " he says .
" but to misuse tourism is wrong .
and all this talk of eco-tourism is just fashionable .
today there is a lot of greenwashing . "
samir acharya is not only worried about the region ’ s biodiversity .
he also wants to know who the tourist boom is supposed to help .
the indian settlers or the indigenous population ?
he thinks that the jarawas , who live on a reserve , are particularly at threat .
shyami sodhi , who is in charge of the well-being of the tribes on the islands of andaman and nicobar , worries that the jarawas could lose their traditions .
" they live next to a big road .
their lifestyle and their culture are coming into contact with our lifestyle and our culture more and more .
we ’ re getting closer to another .
we have to be careful . "
six years ago , india ’ s supreme court ruled that the road should be closed down but this has not happened .
there are rumours that some tourists pay a lot of money to visit the jarawas .
they exchange photos for a biscuit or some other item of food that the jarawas do not know .
at the moment , these are only isolated incidents but observers worry that this paradise on earth could well disappear over the next few years .

1 2009 , beijing ’ s tiananmen square was transformed into a stage to celebrate the founding of the people ’ s republic of china 60 years ago .
there was a large military parade to demonstrate china 's military might .
despite the country 's economic strengths , it still has far to go in terms of human rights . president hu jintao opened the 60th anniversary ceremony to firing canons , wearing a suit like mao zedong 's .
a two-hour parade , which included tanks and missiles , 8,000 soldiers , 60 floats and 100,000 well trained civilians symbolised the country ’ s growing military and economic might .
but there was much criticism of china on the occasion .
in hong kong , for example , there were massive demonstrations against the lack of progress on human rights and democracy .
earlier on in 2009 , on the 50th anniversary of the failed tibetan uprising in march , people all over the world demonstrated for tibet ’ s autonomy .
after 50 years in exile , the dalai lama has not given up the fight .
“ the problem with the people ’ s republic of china is that they consider me a trouble maker , ” he said this year .
“ so it is my duty to create more trouble . ”
trouble in xinjiang there was also “ trouble ” in china 's north-western region of xinjiang , where the uighurs and majority han chinese clashed in july , causing some 200 deaths .
the mainly muslim uighurs complain - like many other minorities in china - of cultural and religious repression .
2009 also marked the 20th anniversary of the massacre on tiananmen square , which can arguably be considered the most potent symbol of chinese repression in the country ’ s recent past .
the chinese media were banned from discussing it .
the british human rights risk atlas ranked china 12th “ most risky country ” overall for human rights this year .
for child labour , forced labour , and violations of freedom of association , discrimination and working conditions , china ranked highest .
“ no transparency in china ” liu xiaobo is one of china 's most prominent dissidents and is currently awaiting sentencing on charges of subversion .
" i have lost faith , ” his wife liu xia said in august .
“ there is absolutely no transparency here .
if you live in a country in which freedom of speech isn ’ t worth a dime , anyone can be convicted . ”
“ i am very worried , ” she continued .
“ they have accused him of felonies , for which he could receive up to 15 years in prison .
he didn ’ t do anything , aside from telling the truth and stating his opinion .
here in china they call that ‘ breaking the law ’ . ”
liu xiaobo 's sentence is expected to be handed down on christmas day .
optimism about economic situation although china was criticised for its human rights record , its economic situation in 2009 gave rise to hope .
despite world recession , china ’ s economy continued to grow at a rate of eight to 10 percent .
the optimism expressed by many economists at the beginning of the year seems to have been vindicated .
“ the statistics are showing recovery in many sectors of the economy , ” the head of the chinese central bank , zhal xiaochuan , said in january .
“ this means that our economic stimulus programme is taking hold .
the chinese state council has made it clear that our reaction to the crisis must be quick and resolute . ”
the positive signs in china 's economy have been attributed to an increase in chinese consumerism and lending and investments abroad .
with this strategy , experts say china is leading the world out of the financial crisis and will continue to do so in 2010 .

over 100 buses were burnt , and shops and businesses attacked overnight .
the strike was called after the federal government said the demand for a telangana state would be considered after consultation with all parties .
earlier the government had announced that it would allow the creation of telangana irrespective of opposition .
an estimated 35 million people will live in the new state .
