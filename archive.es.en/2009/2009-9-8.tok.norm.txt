the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumann 's death sentence became a prison sentence germany 's major political parties had first declined to support the current legislation because it was brought before parliament by the left party .
many of the party 's leading figures were once members of the communist party of former east germany .
the parties finally agreed to sponsor the bill when the left party removed itself from the list of backers .
arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .
but a justice ministry review headed by hans hugo klein , a former judge at the constitutional court , established that the nazis ' treason law was a merciless instrument of repression , and was so vague that it gave room to arbitrary rulings .
rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .
since then he has fought an uphill battle against prejudice and bureaucracy to see the records wiped clean .
he is the sole survivor of the group who initiated the association 20 years ago .
" i did n't want to be part of it any longer " baumann was an infantryman in occupied france when he deserted his regiment in 1942 .
he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .
his sentence was converted to 12 years imprisonment , and he was sent to the army prison in torgau , germany .
he survived , but when he returned to germany after the war , he found that the stigma of treason clung to him .
" i received many death threats .
we were treated like as cowards , scumbags and traitors .
no one was on our side . "
one group left to fight for it took years before opinion started to turn .
finally , in 1998 and 2002 , laws were passed that rehabilitated conscientious objectors , those found guilty of undermining the war effort , spies and deserters – among them baumann himself .
that left the small group of those charged with military treason - and baumann continued his battle on their behalf , despite the fact that his own honor had been restored .
according to baumann , 68 death sentences were handed down for wartime treason , and they were all executed but for one .
general walther von seydlitz-kurzbach survived because he was by that time a russian prisoner of war .
baumann is pleased that parliament is about to close one of the last chapter 's of nazi military arbitrariness .
but that does not mean he has forgotten the past : “ it was such a horror , it hounds me to this very day . ” db / afp / dpa / epd editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .

one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .
i do n't see that as a big problem .

the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumann 's death sentence became a prison sentence germany 's major political parties had first declined to support the current legislation because it was brought before parliament by the left party .
many of the party 's leading figures were once members of the communist party of former east germany .
the parties finally agreed to sponsor the bill when the left party removed itself from the list of backers .
arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .
but a justice ministry review headed by hans hugo klein , a former judge at the constitutional court , established that the nazis ' treason law was a merciless instrument of repression , and was so vague that it gave room to arbitrary rulings .
rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .
since then he has fought an uphill battle against prejudice and bureaucracy to see the records wiped clean .
he is the sole survivor of the group who initiated the association 20 years ago .
" i did n't want to be part of it any longer " baumann was an infantryman in occupied france when he deserted his regiment in 1942 .
he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .
his sentence was converted to 12 years imprisonment , and he was sent to the army prison in torgau , germany .
he survived , but when he returned to germany after the war , he found that the stigma of treason clung to him .
" i received many death threats .
we were treated like as cowards , scumbags and traitors .
no one was on our side . "
one group left to fight for it took years before opinion started to turn .
finally , in 1998 and 2002 , laws were passed that rehabilitated conscientious objectors , those found guilty of undermining the war effort , spies and deserters – among them baumann himself .
that left the small group of those charged with military treason - and baumann continued his battle on their behalf , despite the fact that his own honor had been restored .
according to baumann , 68 death sentences were handed down for wartime treason , and they were all executed but for one .
general walther von seydlitz-kurzbach survived because he was by that time a russian prisoner of war .
baumann is pleased that parliament is about to close one of the last chapter 's of nazi military arbitrariness .

he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .

the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumann 's death sentence became a prison sentence germany 's major political parties had first declined to support the current legislation because it was brought before parliament by the left party .
many of the party 's leading figures were once members of the communist party of former east germany .
the parties finally agreed to sponsor the bill when the left party removed itself from the list of backers .
arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .
but a justice ministry review headed by hans hugo klein , a former judge at the constitutional court , established that the nazis ' treason law was a merciless instrument of repression , and was so vague that it gave room to arbitrary rulings .
rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .

but decisions over details of the new monument in berlin have caused some controversy . the monument , which bears the inscription " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom , " is located near the headquarters of the defense ministry in berlin .
some critics have said it should be located closer to germany 's parliament building - in a different part of the city - as the german army is officially the parliament 's army .
" the soldiers would have picked out another place for their monument .
they would have wanted it to be in a more prominent place , such as near the reichstag building , " said reinhold robbe , the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces .
" in the end , only the parliament decides when and where soldiers are going to be sent to serve . "
the german army , or bundeswehr , was founded in 1955 , and to date , around 3,100 service members have died while in active duty .
manner of death an issue although the monument 's opening comes at a time when a growing number of german soldiers are being killed in afghanistan , the monument does not differentiate between soldiers and civilian employees of the army who lost their lives due to accidents or suicide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meck and a model of his memorial reinhard fuerher is the president of the german war graves commission and thinks a distinction should be made .
" there 's a big difference between someone in the bundeswehr who is killed because of a careless accident and someone who was sent by the german parliament into a war-like situation , " fuerher said .
" accidents , suicide - it 's all a part of this , " counters robbe .
" for the loved ones of a dead soldier it 's still a bad thing when someone loses their life . "
a modern memorial the plans for a monument for german soldiers killed in service has been around for some time .
the idea came to defense minister franz-josef jung during a visit to afghanistan in 2005 .
there , german soldiers had erected their own monument to their fallen comrades .
despite criticism from members of parliament , jung has always been adamant that the memorial be placed near the headquarters of the bundeswehr .
while the location and the exact meaning of the monument have led to debate , the monument itself has been widely accepted .
munich-based architect andreas meck is the architect of the memorial and presented his plan in 2007 .
construction officially began with a groundbreaking ceremony last november .
the final structure is about 40 meters -lrb- 131 feet -rrb- long and is supported by columns .
a computer screen cycles through the names of dead soldiers , briefly displaying each one before blending in the next .

but decisions over details of the new monument in berlin have caused some controversy . the monument , which bears the inscription " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom , " is located near the headquarters of the defense ministry in berlin .
some critics have said it should be located closer to germany 's parliament building - in a different part of the city - as the german army is officially the parliament 's army .
" the soldiers would have picked out another place for their monument .
they would have wanted it to be in a more prominent place , such as near the reichstag building , " said reinhold robbe , the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces .
" in the end , only the parliament decides when and where soldiers are going to be sent to serve . "
the german army , or bundeswehr , was founded in 1955 , and to date , around 3,100 service members have died while in active duty .
manner of death an issue although the monument 's opening comes at a time when a growing number of german soldiers are being killed in afghanistan , the monument does not differentiate between soldiers and civilian employees of the army who lost their lives due to accidents or suicide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meck and a model of his memorial reinhard fuerher is the president of the german war graves commission and thinks a distinction should be made .
" there 's a big difference between someone in the bundeswehr who is killed because of a careless accident and someone who was sent by the german parliament into a war-like situation , " fuerher said .
" accidents , suicide - it 's all a part of this , " counters robbe .
" for the loved ones of a dead soldier it 's still a bad thing when someone loses their life . "
a modern memorial the plans for a monument for german soldiers killed in service has been around for some time .
the idea came to defense minister franz-josef jung during a visit to afghanistan in 2005 .
there , german soldiers had erected their own monument to their fallen comrades .
despite criticism from members of parliament , jung has always been adamant that the memorial be placed near the headquarters of the bundeswehr .
while the location and the exact meaning of the monument have led to debate , the monument itself has been widely accepted .
munich-based architect andreas meck is the architect of the memorial and presented his plan in 2007 .

development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "
his advice is that , " we should support independent african solutions only . "
exception to the rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benin 's president , thomas yayi boni , has tried to crack down on corruption that is exactly what hubi and vinciane , a small belgian aid organisation , does in the republic of benin .
talking to deutsche welle chairman piet van assche confirms that their approach is different : " in almost 30 years in benin we never took any initiative of our own .
we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .
but the author distinguishes between rich and poor .
" i do n't condemn the policeman , who collects a bribe on the side of the road .
i do n't condemn the poor , who are often desperate to survive .
i condemn the political elites , who do n't give a damn about the people . "
paul banoba from transparency international in berlin , which studies and fights corruption worldwide , disagrees .
" you can not just blame the top , " he says in an interview with deutsche welle .
" in comparing corrupt policemen with corrupt politicians volker seitz may want to make a distinction between petty corruption and large-scale corruption .
but we define corruption as an evil in itself , at whatever level it occurs .
there is corruption at every level , it is widespread . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money makes the world go round especially for africa 's political elites it 's not easy to talk about corruption .
doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , which is represented in nearly all african countries , turned down deutsche welle 's interview request , arguing that , " msf is not involved in corruption , never deals with officials who expect a personal benefit and therefore hardly can answer the questions .
msf is neutral and does not officially blame others without being involved itself . "
piet van assche from hubi and vinciane says his company has managed to stay clear of any allegations of corruption : " to my knowledge we 've never had anything to do with corruption . "
democracy and its many faces van assche says that the transition of power in benin has gone smoothly since he started working there in the mid-eighties .
but volker seitz warns that european democracy does n't always fit into an african environment : " it 's difficult to transfer our western parliamentarian system to africa .
what counts is the political will to improve the standard of living .
education is important .
human rights must be respected .
those things , i believe , are not negotiable , but it does n't have to be parliamentarian democracy as we know it . "

development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "
his advice is that , " we should support independent african solutions only . "
exception to the rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benin 's president , thomas yayi boni , has tried to crack down on corruption that is exactly what hubi and vinciane , a small belgian aid organisation , does in the republic of benin .
talking to deutsche welle chairman piet van assche confirms that their approach is different : " in almost 30 years in benin we never took any initiative of our own .
we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .
but the author distinguishes between rich and poor .
" i do n't condemn the policeman , who collects a bribe on the side of the road .
i do n't condemn the poor , who are often desperate to survive .
i condemn the political elites , who do n't give a damn about the people . "
paul banoba from transparency international in berlin , which studies and fights corruption worldwide , disagrees .
" you can not just blame the top , " he says in an interview with deutsche welle .
" in comparing corrupt policemen with corrupt politicians volker seitz may want to make a distinction between petty corruption and large-scale corruption .
but we define corruption as an evil in itself , at whatever level it occurs .
there is corruption at every level , it is widespread . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money makes the world go round especially for africa 's political elites it 's not easy to talk about corruption .
doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , which is represented in nearly all african countries , turned down deutsche welle 's interview request , arguing that , " msf is not involved in corruption , never deals with officials who expect a personal benefit and therefore hardly can answer the questions .
msf is neutral and does not officially blame others without being involved itself . "
piet van assche from hubi and vinciane says his company has managed to stay clear of any allegations of corruption : " to my knowledge we 've never had anything to do with corruption . "
democracy and its many faces van assche says that the transition of power in benin has gone smoothly since he started working there in the mid-eighties .
but volker seitz warns that european democracy does n't always fit into an african environment : " it 's difficult to transfer our western parliamentarian system to africa .
what counts is the political will to improve the standard of living .
education is important .
human rights must be respected .
those things , i believe , are not negotiable , but it does n't have to be parliamentarian democracy as we know it . "

one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .
i do n't see that as a big problem .

the strategic partnership between both countries was first launched last year and gives brazil more clout in latin america . the partnership covers the production of 50 helicopters , four conventional submarines and the development of the first brazilian nuclear submarine , even though the contract explicitly excludes the transfer of french nuclear know-how .
there are also investments planned in industrial and harbour facilities .
the project will cost the brazilian government around 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.4 billion -rrb- and will be financed by a consortium made up of six european banks .
the military cooperation includes the purchase of 36 french fighter planes , a deal that will give brazil one of the most advanced combat aircraft in latin america .
a valuable investment ?
however , german defence experts are sceptical about the military cooperation .
they believe the billion-euro treaty , which will boost brazil 's military capacity , could trigger an arms race on the continent , without bringing the advantages , which the brazilian government expects .
" right now it is hard to say whether this project will be successful indeed from a technological perspective and whether it will give brazil military advantages compared to other countries .
an ambitious project like this can also turn out to be a failure , " says ottfried nassauer , who is the head of the berlin information center for transatlantic security .
according to nassauer the cooperation with france should not cause any concern for the neighboring countries , as the understanding among the governments on the continent is good .
but he thinks that the money could be invested better elsewhere .
" the question which luiz inacio lula da silva 's government should ask is whether the investments are not too high and whether it is worth it , to spend such large amounts of money for its own political and military status .
there are many other social and economical fields , where the same kind of money most likely would create many more jobs and possibly lead to more transfer of technology .
military technology always costs more than civil technology , " says nassauer .
regional predominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bilateral deal could anger some of brazil 's regional neighbors political scientist daniel flemes , who is an expert for defence politics with the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg , fears that the cooperation with france can cause problems for the cooperation with latin american neighbors and lead to a regional arms race .
" the fact that brazil gains technological know-how out of partnerships outside of latin america , could trigger an arms race on the continent and hinder defence cooperation with the neighbouring countries , " flemes says .
he believes that brazil not only wants to secure its regional predominance with the contract , but is also striving to become a super power . " the country is trying to stabilise its regional predominance , not only on an economical and political , but on a military level as well .
simultaneously it wishes to expand its influence as an emerging country internationally , " flemes says .
but he also thinks brazil 's ambitions are a natural development , as some of its neighbors are expanding their military strength as well .
" some neighboring countries are modernising their military infrastructure .
venezuela spent four billion euros in the last four or five years on arms imports from russia .
also chile has increased its defence budget over the past years .
so brazil does n't stand alone with its military investments .
over the past five years time the total amount of defence expenditure in south america has more than doubled , " say flemes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 08.09.2009 brazil to boost its military standing with strategic french partnership deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil hopes to profit from its strategic partnership with france french president nicolas sarkozy has signed a deal deepening military ties with brazil .
the strategic partnership between both countries was first launched last year and gives brazil more clout in latin america . the partnership covers the production of 50 helicopters , four conventional submarines and the development of the first brazilian nuclear submarine , even though the contract explicitly excludes the transfer of french nuclear know-how .
there are also investments planned in industrial and harbour facilities .
the project will cost the brazilian government around 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.4 billion -rrb- and will be financed by a consortium made up of six european banks .
the military cooperation includes the purchase of 36 french fighter planes , a deal that will give brazil one of the most advanced combat aircraft in latin america .
a valuable investment ?
however , german defence experts are sceptical about the military cooperation .
they believe the billion-euro treaty , which will boost brazil 's military capacity , could trigger an arms race on the continent , without bringing the advantages , which the brazilian government expects .
" right now it is hard to say whether this project will be successful indeed from a technological perspective and whether it will give brazil military advantages compared to other countries .
an ambitious project like this can also turn out to be a failure , " says ottfried nassauer , who is the head of the berlin information center for transatlantic security .
according to nassauer the cooperation with france should not cause any concern for the neighboring countries , as the understanding among the governments on the continent is good .
but he thinks that the money could be invested better elsewhere .
" the question which luiz inacio lula da silva 's government should ask is whether the investments are not too high and whether it is worth it , to spend such large amounts of money for its own political and military status .
there are many other social and economical fields , where the same kind of money most likely would create many more jobs and possibly lead to more transfer of technology .
military technology always costs more than civil technology , " says nassauer .
regional predominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bilateral deal could anger some of brazil 's regional neighbors political scientist daniel flemes , who is an expert for defence politics with the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg , fears that the cooperation with france can cause problems for the cooperation with latin american neighbors and lead to a regional arms race .
" the fact that brazil gains technological know-how out of partnerships outside of latin america , could trigger an arms race on the continent and hinder defence cooperation with the neighbouring countries , " flemes says .
he believes that brazil not only wants to secure its regional predominance with the contract , but is also striving to become a super power . " the country is trying to stabilise its regional predominance , not only on an economical and political , but on a military level as well .
simultaneously it wishes to expand its influence as an emerging country internationally , " flemes says .
but he also thinks brazil 's ambitions are a natural development , as some of its neighbors are expanding their military strength as well .
" some neighboring countries are modernising their military infrastructure .
venezuela spent four billion euros in the last four or five years on arms imports from russia .
also chile has increased its defence budget over the past years .
so brazil does n't stand alone with its military investments .
over the past five years time the total amount of defence expenditure in south america has more than doubled , " say flemes .

the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumann 's death sentence became a prison sentence germany 's major political parties had first declined to support the current legislation because it was brought before parliament by the left party .
many of the party 's leading figures were once members of the communist party of former east germany .
the parties finally agreed to sponsor the bill when the left party removed itself from the list of backers .
arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .
but a justice ministry review headed by hans hugo klein , a former judge at the constitutional court , established that the nazis ' treason law was a merciless instrument of repression , and was so vague that it gave room to arbitrary rulings .
rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .
since then he has fought an uphill battle against prejudice and bureaucracy to see the records wiped clean .
he is the sole survivor of the group who initiated the association 20 years ago .
" i did n't want to be part of it any longer " baumann was an infantryman in occupied france when he deserted his regiment in 1942 .
he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .
his sentence was converted to 12 years imprisonment , and he was sent to the army prison in torgau , germany .
he survived , but when he returned to germany after the war , he found that the stigma of treason clung to him .
" i received many death threats .
we were treated like as cowards , scumbags and traitors .
no one was on our side . "
one group left to fight for it took years before opinion started to turn .
finally , in 1998 and 2002 , laws were passed that rehabilitated conscientious objectors , those found guilty of undermining the war effort , spies and deserters – among them baumann himself .
that left the small group of those charged with military treason - and baumann continued his battle on their behalf , despite the fact that his own honor had been restored .
according to baumann , 68 death sentences were handed down for wartime treason , and they were all executed but for one .
general walther von seydlitz-kurzbach survived because he was by that time a russian prisoner of war .
baumann is pleased that parliament is about to close one of the last chapter 's of nazi military arbitrariness .
but that does not mean he has forgotten the past : “ it was such a horror , it hounds me to this very day . ” db / afp / dpa / epd editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .

this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

" every innocent person who is killed in afghanistan is one too many , " merkel told parliamentarians in berlin .
while promising a thorough investigation and a full report on the raid , which is believed to have left dozens of taliban militants as well as civilians dead , merkel slammed critics for drawing premature conclusions .
" i will ensure that we will not put a gloss on anything .
i will also ensure that we will not accept any premature judgments .
and having experienced what i have in recent days , i say very clearly : i will not take this from anyone , either here in germany or from abroad , " she said .
on saturday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner had called the airstrike a " big mistake . "
afghan president hamid karzai had told french daily le figaro in an interview published on monday that the attack was an " error of judgment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike targeted two fuel trucks that were hijacked by taliban militants " militarily necessary and correct " the german defense ministry on monday described the airstrike as " militarily necessary and correct " because it prevented the taliban from using the two hijacked fuel trucks as mobile bombs .
germany defense minister franz josef jung of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- has faced criticism over his information policy as well as calls for him to step down .
his ministry had initially said that the airstrike had only killed taliban militants .
however , on monday jung was forced to acknowledge that he could no longer rule out any civilian casualties , and on tuesday the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan indicated for the first time that civilians were probably killed in the attack , however , without providing any exact casualty figures .
" believing civilians were not in the area , the local isaf commander authorized an airstrike , which destroyed the two fuel trucks , " isaf said in a statement .
" subsequent review has led isaf to believe that along with insurgents , civilians also were killed and injured in the strike . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defence minister jung says the airstrike was necessary not an election campaign with all but one german political party supporting the government 's stance on the afghanistan mission , parliamentarians were quick to affirm on tuesday that the tragic incident would not be exploited as a campaign issue ahead of the sept .
27 national election .
the only party in the bundestag calling for the immediate withdrawal of germany 's 4,200 troops is the left party .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " oskar lafontaine , the co-leader of the opposition left told parliament on tuesday .
however , the left party and its leaders have a reputation in germany for demanding what is currently popular rather than politically expedient .
even before the airstrike controversy , a poll in july showed that up to 69 percent of germans wanted their soldiers to pull out of afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine , co-leader of the left party , wants germany out of afghanistan government remains committed despite the german public 's reservations over the afghanistan mission , the chancellor has refrained from giving any pullout date for german forces , and she also sidestepped the issue during her speech on tuesday .
instead , merkel drew attention to what had brought international forces to the war-torn country in the first place .
" it was afghanistan , controlled by the taliban and al qaeda , that was the breeding ground for the terror of september 11 , " merkel said .
" the september 11 attacks were followed by dreadful attacks in europe - in madrid and in london .
we know too that germany is in their sights ...
the engagement in afghanistan is our reaction to terror .
that 's where it came from , not the other way around . "
merkel also referred to a joint german-british-franco proposal for an international conference this year to pressure the afghan government to take on more responsibilities , enabling the withdrawal of coalition forces .
" for germany , britain and france , this conference is about creating the conditions for developing an internationally agreed handover strategy , " merkel said on tuesday .
" our overriding political goal is and remains an afghanistan that can handle its own security . "
it was unclear where and when the conference would be held , but the united nations , which is to host the event , has proposed kabul as the venue. nk / reuters / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung on tuesday that he hoped gm would lay out a clear course of action before the iaa international motor show opens in frankfurt on sept .
17 .
but the handelsblatt financial daily quoted sources close to the opel talks as saying gm is likely to postpone its decision again and wait until after the german federal election on sept .
27 before making any announcement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg wants gm to announce its plans by sept .
17 negotiations on opel have already gone on for months , with issues of state funding and potential job losses turning the sale into a political hot potato ahead of the election .
berlin 's favored bidder is canadian auto parts maker magna .
chancellor angela merkel and the german states think the company 's experience in the car industry puts it in a better position to save more of the 25,000 opel jobs based in germany .
but gm has signaled it would prefer to sell its european unit to belgian-based investment group rhj international , or perhaps even keep the business for itself .
retaining control the head of a pro-business group in chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union , kurt lauk , said gm is unlikely to sell opel to magna because detroit did n't want to pass valuable intellectual property on to magna 's russian partner sberbank .
“ should the russians become co-owners of opel , they 'll get much quicker access to gm 's small-car technology , ” lauk told bloomberg news agency on tuesday .
“ i 'm convinced that would pose a fundamental problem to the new board . ”
lauk , who is also a former board member of daimlerchrysler and audi , said it would be “ commercially wise ” for gm to dismiss both bids and keep opel for itself , using a “ restructuring plan ” to secure the us giant 's presence in the european and russian markets .
softening stance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm is unhappy with magna 's ties to russian bank sberbank recent media reports suggest the german government may have softened its stance on the prospect of gm retaining control of opel .
last week an unnamed german government source told dow jones newswires that berlin would be open to gm keeping opel , as long as it invests its own capital in the company .
german deputy economy minister jochen homann said tuesday that gm would need to present a robust business strategy if it wanted to keep opel .
" ' we are keeping opel ' is not a strategy yet , " he said on the sidelines of an energy conference .
" we have laid the groundwork in the direction of magna , " homann said , reiterating the german government 's support for a deal with magna. sje / afp / dpa / reuters editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .
i do n't see that as a big problem .

the plans by us lawmakers could trigger a trans-atlantic tit-for-tat response with travelers on both sides footing the bill . the european union has raised objections over us plans to introduce a $ 10 charge for travelers entering the us .
if the planned levy is deemed equivalent to a visa , eu lawmakers might decide to retaliate , by forcing entry-visas on us visitors to the 27-member bloc .
currently , 29 european countries are part of the us visa waiver program -lrb- among 35 countries worldwide -rrb- , permitting european tourists to enter the united states without a visa .
however , the us introduced an online registration process earlier this year , requiring european visitors to confirm their visa-free status , three days before their departure - a move that irritated eu officials in brussels at the time .
the european commission signaled that if the us changed the requirements of its electronic system for travel authorization -lrb- esta -rrb- , the eu might be forced to review its own position .
" the introduction of a fee by the us , would require a new assessment of the european commission ... to evaluate whether the esta system , is tantamount to a visa or not , " said commission spokesman michele cercone .
scanning for terrorists eu officials believe a fee would also discourage european visitors from registering online , which - as cercone argued - would undermine the security objectives of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe may retaliate if the us introduces its $ 10 levy " the introduction of such a fee would constitute a step backward in our joint endeavor to ease transatlantic mobility , " cercone said .
that argument resonates with european civil liberties groups , which see the electronic registration process - with or without a fee - as an invasion of privacy rights .
they say the us has no right to the personal information of eu citizens .
the us argues that information is crucial in the fight against terrorism .
washington says the system gives us intelligence officials a 72 hours ' heads-up ' if unwanted visitors -lrb- or would-be terrorists -rrb- are planning to travel to the us .
officials in brussels are reluctant to comment further , stressing the plan to introduce a $ 10 charge is still being debated in washington .
but other eu representatives have been less cautious .
" only in ' alice in wonderland ' could a penalty be seen as promoting the activity on which it is imposed , " the european commission 's ambassador to the united states , john bruton , said . other eu objections , especially in countries where credit cards are less widely used , include the question of how any levy would be paid .
there is a growing sense in brussels , that forcing europeans to pay $ 10 to enter the united states by credit card and online only discriminates against those visitors who neither use the internet nor possess a credit card .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility the $ 10 registration fee , which would last two years before having to be renewed , has been described by us lawmakers as ' nominal . '
they say the money generated by the registration fee , would go towards teaching visitors how to use the electronic registration process as well as other programs to promote travel to the us .
the weakest link another source of tension between the eu and us over the visa waiver program , involves the way the deal is negotiated .
eu officials argue washington should stop negotiating with individual eu countries bilaterally , and instead , work with the european union has a whole .
but washington insiders accuse the eu of hypocrisy , arguing that if eu unity is so important to the europeans , then individual countries benefiting from the visa waiver program should be prepared to give it up in solidarity with those eu member states that continue to be excluded .
us administration officials also insist there are live security threats in europe .
washington clearly views greece as problematic .
it is the only ' old ' eu member state which has been denied the visa waiver program .
us intelligence does not trust greek passport security and is unconvinced by athens ' commitment to fighting terrorism and extremists .
but brussels argues , no eu member state should be left in limbo - and negotiating with one eu country , should mean , negotiating with all .

but decisions over details of the new monument in berlin have caused some controversy . the monument , which bears the inscription " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom , " is located near the headquarters of the defense ministry in berlin .
some critics have said it should be located closer to germany 's parliament building - in a different part of the city - as the german army is officially the parliament 's army .
" the soldiers would have picked out another place for their monument .
they would have wanted it to be in a more prominent place , such as near the reichstag building , " said reinhold robbe , the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces .
" in the end , only the parliament decides when and where soldiers are going to be sent to serve . "
the german army , or bundeswehr , was founded in 1955 , and to date , around 3,100 service members have died while in active duty .
manner of death an issue although the monument 's opening comes at a time when a growing number of german soldiers are being killed in afghanistan , the monument does not differentiate between soldiers and civilian employees of the army who lost their lives due to accidents or suicide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meck and a model of his memorial reinhard fuerher is the president of the german war graves commission and thinks a distinction should be made .
" there 's a big difference between someone in the bundeswehr who is killed because of a careless accident and someone who was sent by the german parliament into a war-like situation , " fuerher said .
" accidents , suicide - it 's all a part of this , " counters robbe .
" for the loved ones of a dead soldier it 's still a bad thing when someone loses their life . "
a modern memorial the plans for a monument for german soldiers killed in service has been around for some time .
the idea came to defense minister franz-josef jung during a visit to afghanistan in 2005 .
there , german soldiers had erected their own monument to their fallen comrades .
despite criticism from members of parliament , jung has always been adamant that the memorial be placed near the headquarters of the bundeswehr .
while the location and the exact meaning of the monument have led to debate , the monument itself has been widely accepted .
munich-based architect andreas meck is the architect of the memorial and presented his plan in 2007 .
construction officially began with a groundbreaking ceremony last november .
the final structure is about 40 meters -lrb- 131 feet -rrb- long and is supported by columns .
a computer screen cycles through the names of dead soldiers , briefly displaying each one before blending in the next .

one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .
i do n't see that as a big problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 08.09.2009 german leaders eagerly await gm board meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors has yet to make a clear announcement on opel 's future general motors ' 13-member board of directors may make a decision on opel 's future at a two-day meeting in detroit . the german government , which provided a 1.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.2-billion -rrb- emergency loan to keep opel solvent , has been pressuring gm to choose a buyer for its european unit as soon as possible .
german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung on tuesday that he hoped gm would lay out a clear course of action before the iaa international motor show opens in frankfurt on sept .
17 .
but the handelsblatt financial daily quoted sources close to the opel talks as saying gm is likely to postpone its decision again and wait until after the german federal election on sept .
27 before making any announcement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg wants gm to announce its plans by sept .
17 negotiations on opel have already gone on for months , with issues of state funding and potential job losses turning the sale into a political hot potato ahead of the election .
berlin 's favored bidder is canadian auto parts maker magna .
chancellor angela merkel and the german states think the company 's experience in the car industry puts it in a better position to save more of the 25,000 opel jobs based in germany .
but gm has signaled it would prefer to sell its european unit to belgian-based investment group rhj international , or perhaps even keep the business for itself .
retaining control the head of a pro-business group in chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union , kurt lauk , said gm is unlikely to sell opel to magna because detroit did n't want to pass valuable intellectual property on to magna 's russian partner sberbank .
“ should the russians become co-owners of opel , they 'll get much quicker access to gm 's small-car technology , ” lauk told bloomberg news agency on tuesday .
“ i 'm convinced that would pose a fundamental problem to the new board . ”
lauk , who is also a former board member of daimlerchrysler and audi , said it would be “ commercially wise ” for gm to dismiss both bids and keep opel for itself , using a “ restructuring plan ” to secure the us giant 's presence in the european and russian markets .
softening stance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm is unhappy with magna 's ties to russian bank sberbank recent media reports suggest the german government may have softened its stance on the prospect of gm retaining control of opel .
last week an unnamed german government source told dow jones newswires that berlin would be open to gm keeping opel , as long as it invests its own capital in the company .
german deputy economy minister jochen homann said tuesday that gm would need to present a robust business strategy if it wanted to keep opel .
" ' we are keeping opel ' is not a strategy yet , " he said on the sidelines of an energy conference .
" we have laid the groundwork in the direction of magna , " homann said , reiterating the german government 's support for a deal with magna. sje / afp / dpa / reuters editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de experts see five possible solutions to the opel drama like a soap opera entering its 15th season , the opel saga took a twist this week when it was revealed that general motors had turned down magna 's offer for the firm .
what could happen to the automaker now ? -lrb- 27.08.2009 -rrb- opinion : gm is happy to keep its opel unit in limbo opel 's future is hanging by a thread , and its bankrupt parent company , us carmaker general motors , seems happy to keep it that way for the time being .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 08.09.2009 corrupt political elites block development in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's corrupt political elites are leaving their people to suffer african leaders are responsible for the problems in their countries , and not former colonial powers .
development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "
his advice is that , " we should support independent african solutions only . "
exception to the rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benin 's president , thomas yayi boni , has tried to crack down on corruption that is exactly what hubi and vinciane , a small belgian aid organisation , does in the republic of benin .
talking to deutsche welle chairman piet van assche confirms that their approach is different : " in almost 30 years in benin we never took any initiative of our own .
we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .
but the author distinguishes between rich and poor .
" i do n't condemn the policeman , who collects a bribe on the side of the road .
i do n't condemn the poor , who are often desperate to survive .
i condemn the political elites , who do n't give a damn about the people . "
paul banoba from transparency international in berlin , which studies and fights corruption worldwide , disagrees .
" you can not just blame the top , " he says in an interview with deutsche welle .
" in comparing corrupt policemen with corrupt politicians volker seitz may want to make a distinction between petty corruption and large-scale corruption .
but we define corruption as an evil in itself , at whatever level it occurs .
there is corruption at every level , it is widespread . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money makes the world go round especially for africa 's political elites it 's not easy to talk about corruption .
doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , which is represented in nearly all african countries , turned down deutsche welle 's interview request , arguing that , " msf is not involved in corruption , never deals with officials who expect a personal benefit and therefore hardly can answer the questions .
msf is neutral and does not officially blame others without being involved itself . "
piet van assche from hubi and vinciane says his company has managed to stay clear of any allegations of corruption : " to my knowledge we 've never had anything to do with corruption . "
democracy and its many faces van assche says that the transition of power in benin has gone smoothly since he started working there in the mid-eighties .
but volker seitz warns that european democracy does n't always fit into an african environment : " it 's difficult to transfer our western parliamentarian system to africa .
what counts is the political will to improve the standard of living .
education is important .
human rights must be respected .
those things , i believe , are not negotiable , but it does n't have to be parliamentarian democracy as we know it . "

he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?

the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumann 's death sentence became a prison sentence germany 's major political parties had first declined to support the current legislation because it was brought before parliament by the left party .
many of the party 's leading figures were once members of the communist party of former east germany .
the parties finally agreed to sponsor the bill when the left party removed itself from the list of backers .
arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .
but a justice ministry review headed by hans hugo klein , a former judge at the constitutional court , established that the nazis ' treason law was a merciless instrument of repression , and was so vague that it gave room to arbitrary rulings .
rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .
since then he has fought an uphill battle against prejudice and bureaucracy to see the records wiped clean .
he is the sole survivor of the group who initiated the association 20 years ago .
" i did n't want to be part of it any longer " baumann was an infantryman in occupied france when he deserted his regiment in 1942 .
he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .
his sentence was converted to 12 years imprisonment , and he was sent to the army prison in torgau , germany .
he survived , but when he returned to germany after the war , he found that the stigma of treason clung to him .
" i received many death threats .
we were treated like as cowards , scumbags and traitors .
no one was on our side . "
one group left to fight for it took years before opinion started to turn .
finally , in 1998 and 2002 , laws were passed that rehabilitated conscientious objectors , those found guilty of undermining the war effort , spies and deserters – among them baumann himself .
that left the small group of those charged with military treason - and baumann continued his battle on their behalf , despite the fact that his own honor had been restored .
according to baumann , 68 death sentences were handed down for wartime treason , and they were all executed but for one .
general walther von seydlitz-kurzbach survived because he was by that time a russian prisoner of war .
baumann is pleased that parliament is about to close one of the last chapter 's of nazi military arbitrariness .
but that does not mean he has forgotten the past : “ it was such a horror , it hounds me to this very day . ” db / afp / dpa / epd editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.09.2009 ruettgers ' romania slur meant to placate the far right , author says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers relies on inflammatory rhetoric , according to georgescu romanian-born writer vlad georgescu has filed charges of sedition and defamation against the premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia .
he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumann 's death sentence became a prison sentence germany 's major political parties had first declined to support the current legislation because it was brought before parliament by the left party .
many of the party 's leading figures were once members of the communist party of former east germany .
the parties finally agreed to sponsor the bill when the left party removed itself from the list of backers .
arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .
but a justice ministry review headed by hans hugo klein , a former judge at the constitutional court , established that the nazis ' treason law was a merciless instrument of repression , and was so vague that it gave room to arbitrary rulings .
rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .
since then he has fought an uphill battle against prejudice and bureaucracy to see the records wiped clean .
he is the sole survivor of the group who initiated the association 20 years ago .
" i did n't want to be part of it any longer " baumann was an infantryman in occupied france when he deserted his regiment in 1942 .
he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .
his sentence was converted to 12 years imprisonment , and he was sent to the army prison in torgau , germany .
he survived , but when he returned to germany after the war , he found that the stigma of treason clung to him .
" i received many death threats .
we were treated like as cowards , scumbags and traitors .
no one was on our side . "
one group left to fight for it took years before opinion started to turn .
finally , in 1998 and 2002 , laws were passed that rehabilitated conscientious objectors , those found guilty of undermining the war effort , spies and deserters – among them baumann himself .
that left the small group of those charged with military treason - and baumann continued his battle on their behalf , despite the fact that his own honor had been restored .
according to baumann , 68 death sentences were handed down for wartime treason , and they were all executed but for one .
general walther von seydlitz-kurzbach survived because he was by that time a russian prisoner of war .
baumann is pleased that parliament is about to close one of the last chapter 's of nazi military arbitrariness .
but that does not mean he has forgotten the past : “ it was such a horror , it hounds me to this very day . ” db / afp / dpa / epd editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "
his advice is that , " we should support independent african solutions only . "
exception to the rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benin 's president , thomas yayi boni , has tried to crack down on corruption that is exactly what hubi and vinciane , a small belgian aid organisation , does in the republic of benin .
talking to deutsche welle chairman piet van assche confirms that their approach is different : " in almost 30 years in benin we never took any initiative of our own .
we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .
but the author distinguishes between rich and poor .
" i do n't condemn the policeman , who collects a bribe on the side of the road .
i do n't condemn the poor , who are often desperate to survive .
i condemn the political elites , who do n't give a damn about the people . "
paul banoba from transparency international in berlin , which studies and fights corruption worldwide , disagrees .
" you can not just blame the top , " he says in an interview with deutsche welle .
" in comparing corrupt policemen with corrupt politicians volker seitz may want to make a distinction between petty corruption and large-scale corruption .
but we define corruption as an evil in itself , at whatever level it occurs .
there is corruption at every level , it is widespread . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money makes the world go round especially for africa 's political elites it 's not easy to talk about corruption .
doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , which is represented in nearly all african countries , turned down deutsche welle 's interview request , arguing that , " msf is not involved in corruption , never deals with officials who expect a personal benefit and therefore hardly can answer the questions .
msf is neutral and does not officially blame others without being involved itself . "
piet van assche from hubi and vinciane says his company has managed to stay clear of any allegations of corruption : " to my knowledge we 've never had anything to do with corruption . "
democracy and its many faces van assche says that the transition of power in benin has gone smoothly since he started working there in the mid-eighties .
but volker seitz warns that european democracy does n't always fit into an african environment : " it 's difficult to transfer our western parliamentarian system to africa .
what counts is the political will to improve the standard of living .
education is important .
human rights must be respected .
those things , i believe , are not negotiable , but it does n't have to be parliamentarian democracy as we know it . "

german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung on tuesday that he hoped gm would lay out a clear course of action before the iaa international motor show opens in frankfurt on sept .
17 .
but the handelsblatt financial daily quoted sources close to the opel talks as saying gm is likely to postpone its decision again and wait until after the german federal election on sept .
27 before making any announcement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg wants gm to announce its plans by sept .
17 negotiations on opel have already gone on for months , with issues of state funding and potential job losses turning the sale into a political hot potato ahead of the election .
berlin 's favored bidder is canadian auto parts maker magna .
chancellor angela merkel and the german states think the company 's experience in the car industry puts it in a better position to save more of the 25,000 opel jobs based in germany .
but gm has signaled it would prefer to sell its european unit to belgian-based investment group rhj international , or perhaps even keep the business for itself .
retaining control the head of a pro-business group in chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union , kurt lauk , said gm is unlikely to sell opel to magna because detroit did n't want to pass valuable intellectual property on to magna 's russian partner sberbank .
“ should the russians become co-owners of opel , they 'll get much quicker access to gm 's small-car technology , ” lauk told bloomberg news agency on tuesday .
“ i 'm convinced that would pose a fundamental problem to the new board . ”
lauk , who is also a former board member of daimlerchrysler and audi , said it would be “ commercially wise ” for gm to dismiss both bids and keep opel for itself , using a “ restructuring plan ” to secure the us giant 's presence in the european and russian markets .
softening stance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm is unhappy with magna 's ties to russian bank sberbank recent media reports suggest the german government may have softened its stance on the prospect of gm retaining control of opel .
last week an unnamed german government source told dow jones newswires that berlin would be open to gm keeping opel , as long as it invests its own capital in the company .
german deputy economy minister jochen homann said tuesday that gm would need to present a robust business strategy if it wanted to keep opel .
" ' we are keeping opel ' is not a strategy yet , " he said on the sidelines of an energy conference .
" we have laid the groundwork in the direction of magna , " homann said , reiterating the german government 's support for a deal with magna. sje / afp / dpa / reuters editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de experts see five possible solutions to the opel drama like a soap opera entering its 15th season , the opel saga took a twist this week when it was revealed that general motors had turned down magna 's offer for the firm .
what could happen to the automaker now ? -lrb- 27.08.2009 -rrb- opinion : gm is happy to keep its opel unit in limbo opel 's future is hanging by a thread , and its bankrupt parent company , us carmaker general motors , seems happy to keep it that way for the time being .

development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "
his advice is that , " we should support independent african solutions only . "

talking to deutsche welle chairman piet van assche confirms that their approach is different : " in almost 30 years in benin we never took any initiative of our own .
we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .
but the author distinguishes between rich and poor .
" i do n't condemn the policeman , who collects a bribe on the side of the road .
i do n't condemn the poor , who are often desperate to survive .
i condemn the political elites , who do n't give a damn about the people . "
paul banoba from transparency international in berlin , which studies and fights corruption worldwide , disagrees .
" you can not just blame the top , " he says in an interview with deutsche welle .
" in comparing corrupt policemen with corrupt politicians volker seitz may want to make a distinction between petty corruption and large-scale corruption .
but we define corruption as an evil in itself , at whatever level it occurs .
there is corruption at every level , it is widespread . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money makes the world go round especially for africa 's political elites it 's not easy to talk about corruption .
doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , which is represented in nearly all african countries , turned down deutsche welle 's interview request , arguing that , " msf is not involved in corruption , never deals with officials who expect a personal benefit and therefore hardly can answer the questions .
msf is neutral and does not officially blame others without being involved itself . "
piet van assche from hubi and vinciane says his company has managed to stay clear of any allegations of corruption : " to my knowledge we 've never had anything to do with corruption . "
democracy and its many faces van assche says that the transition of power in benin has gone smoothly since he started working there in the mid-eighties .
but volker seitz warns that european democracy does n't always fit into an african environment : " it 's difficult to transfer our western parliamentarian system to africa .
what counts is the political will to improve the standard of living .
education is important .
human rights must be respected .
those things , i believe , are not negotiable , but it does n't have to be parliamentarian democracy as we know it . "

but decisions over details of the new monument in berlin have caused some controversy . the monument , which bears the inscription " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom , " is located near the headquarters of the defense ministry in berlin .
some critics have said it should be located closer to germany 's parliament building - in a different part of the city - as the german army is officially the parliament 's army .
" the soldiers would have picked out another place for their monument .
they would have wanted it to be in a more prominent place , such as near the reichstag building , " said reinhold robbe , the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces .
" in the end , only the parliament decides when and where soldiers are going to be sent to serve . "
the german army , or bundeswehr , was founded in 1955 , and to date , around 3,100 service members have died while in active duty .

" there 's a big difference between someone in the bundeswehr who is killed because of a careless accident and someone who was sent by the german parliament into a war-like situation , " fuerher said .
" accidents , suicide - it 's all a part of this , " counters robbe .
" for the loved ones of a dead soldier it 's still a bad thing when someone loses their life . "
a modern memorial the plans for a monument for german soldiers killed in service has been around for some time .
the idea came to defense minister franz-josef jung during a visit to afghanistan in 2005 .
there , german soldiers had erected their own monument to their fallen comrades .
despite criticism from members of parliament , jung has always been adamant that the memorial be placed near the headquarters of the bundeswehr .
while the location and the exact meaning of the monument have led to debate , the monument itself has been widely accepted .
munich-based architect andreas meck is the architect of the memorial and presented his plan in 2007 .
construction officially began with a groundbreaking ceremony last november .

development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "
his advice is that , " we should support independent african solutions only . "
exception to the rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benin 's president , thomas yayi boni , has tried to crack down on corruption that is exactly what hubi and vinciane , a small belgian aid organisation , does in the republic of benin .
talking to deutsche welle chairman piet van assche confirms that their approach is different : " in almost 30 years in benin we never took any initiative of our own .
we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .
but the author distinguishes between rich and poor .
" i do n't condemn the policeman , who collects a bribe on the side of the road .
i do n't condemn the poor , who are often desperate to survive .
i condemn the political elites , who do n't give a damn about the people . "
paul banoba from transparency international in berlin , which studies and fights corruption worldwide , disagrees .
" you can not just blame the top , " he says in an interview with deutsche welle .
" in comparing corrupt policemen with corrupt politicians volker seitz may want to make a distinction between petty corruption and large-scale corruption .
but we define corruption as an evil in itself , at whatever level it occurs .
there is corruption at every level , it is widespread . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money makes the world go round especially for africa 's political elites it 's not easy to talk about corruption .

with 91.6 percent of votes counted , president hamid karzai has an absolute majority of 54.1 percent . this is the first time that the figures show that president hamid karzai has enough votes to win in a single round and avoid a runoff poll .
figures released by afghanistan 's independent electoral commission -lrb- iec -rrb- give karzai a commanding lead with 54.1 percent , with 91.6 percent of all votes counted so far .
karzai 's nearest rival , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , is well behind with 28.3 percent .
nearly 5.5 million valid votes have been counted so far , the iec said .
karzai has 2,959,093 votes against abdullah 's 1,546,490 , the electoral commission announced at a news conference on tuesday .
the electoral commission announced on sunday that it had discarded around 200,000 ballots from 447 polling sites nationally where it had found vote fraud .
partial recount ordered on tuesday , the un-backed independent election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- said it too had clear evidence of fraud in the election . the body said it received more than 2,000 complaints , about a third of which could impact the final result .
" in the course of its investigations , the election complaints commission has found clear and convincing evidence of fraud in a number of polling stations , " the ecc said in a statement .
it did not say which candidate gained from the fraud , or where the suspicious ballots had been cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans voted amid taliban threats of violence the ecc has ordered the electoral commission to review votes from 600 more polling stations .
these include stations where a single candidate received more than 95 percent of the votes and those where more than 600 votes were cast , the most that could be cast a single station .
polling stations with suspiciously high voter participation , given a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , are also to be reviewed .
the low turnout , accredited to taliban voter intimidation and violence , is also threatening to cast doubt on the credibility of the process and the legitimacy of the winner .
preliminary results from 100 percent of votes cast across the country are expected to be announced on thursday .
karzai must have 50 percent of all ballots cast , plus one extra ballot , to be declared the winner .
final official results are not due before sept .

" education gives people the tools they need to improve their living situation and take part in public decision making . " while the days of marking official documents with an " x " are long past for the vast majority of germans , not being able to read or write remains a problem that is growing more acute as jobs requiring few skills dry up , according to peter hubertus , the head of germany 's federal literacy association . " there are still people with limited reading and writing skills , and for a long time that has not been a large problem - even for the people who could not read or write at all , " he told deutsche welle .
" but the shift toward a knowledge-based society makes greater educational demands .
it 's clear that a person in germany in 2009 ca n't get by reading and writing at a first or second-grade level . " most functional illiterates attended school bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some students can write only at the most basic of levels hubertus estimated that there are 4 million illiterate people in germany with the reading and writing skills of a primary school student .
the majority of these people attended german schools , which he said posed a major problem for germany as students leave school frustrated and without sufficient basic skills . while numerous courses exist to teach young people how to read and write , it 's difficult to convince many of them how important these skills are . " there are a lot of courses , but we 're unable to reach many young adults , " hubertus said .
" young people tend to be so happy to be finished with school and no longer have to deal with writing .
when they leave school it 's hard to get them involved in a new learning process . " motivating kids to learn but in order for germany to maintain its position as an economic power , schools have to try to keep students from leaving without being able to read or write , according to michael huether , the director of a german economic research institute in cologne . the key to reaching young people is to disguise the learning process with issues they are already involved in , hubertus said , adding that fashion and music have proven to be areas where many illiterate or functionally illiterate teenagers want to make their opinions known . ideally , schools would identify learning deficiencies before kids reach their teens , hubertus said . " we have to strengthen kindergartens , provide better training for teachers and improve primary schools , " he said .
" there needs to be more individualized learning so students are supported step by step .
all this has to happen with topics that are interesting for each of the various age groups . " klaus gehrke -lrb- sms / dpa / ap -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumann 's death sentence became a prison sentence germany 's major political parties had first declined to support the current legislation because it was brought before parliament by the left party .
many of the party 's leading figures were once members of the communist party of former east germany .
the parties finally agreed to sponsor the bill when the left party removed itself from the list of backers .
arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .
but a justice ministry review headed by hans hugo klein , a former judge at the constitutional court , established that the nazis ' treason law was a merciless instrument of repression , and was so vague that it gave room to arbitrary rulings .
rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .
since then he has fought an uphill battle against prejudice and bureaucracy to see the records wiped clean .
he is the sole survivor of the group who initiated the association 20 years ago .
" i did n't want to be part of it any longer " baumann was an infantryman in occupied france when he deserted his regiment in 1942 .
he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .
his sentence was converted to 12 years imprisonment , and he was sent to the army prison in torgau , germany .
he survived , but when he returned to germany after the war , he found that the stigma of treason clung to him .
" i received many death threats .
we were treated like as cowards , scumbags and traitors .
no one was on our side . "
one group left to fight for it took years before opinion started to turn .
finally , in 1998 and 2002 , laws were passed that rehabilitated conscientious objectors , those found guilty of undermining the war effort , spies and deserters – among them baumann himself .
that left the small group of those charged with military treason - and baumann continued his battle on their behalf , despite the fact that his own honor had been restored .
according to baumann , 68 death sentences were handed down for wartime treason , and they were all executed but for one .
general walther von seydlitz-kurzbach survived because he was by that time a russian prisoner of war .
baumann is pleased that parliament is about to close one of the last chapter 's of nazi military arbitrariness .
but that does not mean he has forgotten the past : “ it was such a horror , it hounds me to this very day . ” db / afp / dpa / epd editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but decisions over details of the new monument in berlin have caused some controversy . the monument , which bears the inscription " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom , " is located near the headquarters of the defense ministry in berlin .
some critics have said it should be located closer to germany 's parliament building - in a different part of the city - as the german army is officially the parliament 's army .
" the soldiers would have picked out another place for their monument .
they would have wanted it to be in a more prominent place , such as near the reichstag building , " said reinhold robbe , the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces .
" in the end , only the parliament decides when and where soldiers are going to be sent to serve . "
the german army , or bundeswehr , was founded in 1955 , and to date , around 3,100 service members have died while in active duty .
manner of death an issue although the monument 's opening comes at a time when a growing number of german soldiers are being killed in afghanistan , the monument does not differentiate between soldiers and civilian employees of the army who lost their lives due to accidents or suicide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meck and a model of his memorial reinhard fuerher is the president of the german war graves commission and thinks a distinction should be made .
" there 's a big difference between someone in the bundeswehr who is killed because of a careless accident and someone who was sent by the german parliament into a war-like situation , " fuerher said .
" accidents , suicide - it 's all a part of this , " counters robbe .
" for the loved ones of a dead soldier it 's still a bad thing when someone loses their life . "
a modern memorial the plans for a monument for german soldiers killed in service has been around for some time .
the idea came to defense minister franz-josef jung during a visit to afghanistan in 2005 .
there , german soldiers had erected their own monument to their fallen comrades .
despite criticism from members of parliament , jung has always been adamant that the memorial be placed near the headquarters of the bundeswehr .
while the location and the exact meaning of the monument have led to debate , the monument itself has been widely accepted .
munich-based architect andreas meck is the architect of the memorial and presented his plan in 2007 .
construction officially began with a groundbreaking ceremony last november .
the final structure is about 40 meters -lrb- 131 feet -rrb- long and is supported by columns .
a computer screen cycles through the names of dead soldiers , briefly displaying each one before blending in the next .

one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .
i do n't see that as a big problem .

the plans by us lawmakers could trigger a trans-atlantic tit-for-tat response with travelers on both sides footing the bill . the european union has raised objections over us plans to introduce a $ 10 charge for travelers entering the us .
if the planned levy is deemed equivalent to a visa , eu lawmakers might decide to retaliate , by forcing entry-visas on us visitors to the 27-member bloc .
currently , 29 european countries are part of the us visa waiver program -lrb- among 35 countries worldwide -rrb- , permitting european tourists to enter the united states without a visa .
however , the us introduced an online registration process earlier this year , requiring european visitors to confirm their visa-free status , three days before their departure - a move that irritated eu officials in brussels at the time .
the european commission signaled that if the us changed the requirements of its electronic system for travel authorization -lrb- esta -rrb- , the eu might be forced to review its own position .

the integration of the two telecoms would create an entity with an estimated net value in excess of 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.74 billion -rrb- .
the firm would command a dominating 37 percent market share with around 28.4 million clients .

the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumann 's death sentence became a prison sentence germany 's major political parties had first declined to support the current legislation because it was brought before parliament by the left party .
many of the party 's leading figures were once members of the communist party of former east germany .
the parties finally agreed to sponsor the bill when the left party removed itself from the list of backers .
arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .
but a justice ministry review headed by hans hugo klein , a former judge at the constitutional court , established that the nazis ' treason law was a merciless instrument of repression , and was so vague that it gave room to arbitrary rulings .
rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .
since then he has fought an uphill battle against prejudice and bureaucracy to see the records wiped clean .
he is the sole survivor of the group who initiated the association 20 years ago .
" i did n't want to be part of it any longer " baumann was an infantryman in occupied france when he deserted his regiment in 1942 .
he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .
his sentence was converted to 12 years imprisonment , and he was sent to the army prison in torgau , germany .
he survived , but when he returned to germany after the war , he found that the stigma of treason clung to him .
" i received many death threats .
we were treated like as cowards , scumbags and traitors .
no one was on our side . "
one group left to fight for it took years before opinion started to turn .
finally , in 1998 and 2002 , laws were passed that rehabilitated conscientious objectors , those found guilty of undermining the war effort , spies and deserters – among them baumann himself .
that left the small group of those charged with military treason - and baumann continued his battle on their behalf , despite the fact that his own honor had been restored .
according to baumann , 68 death sentences were handed down for wartime treason , and they were all executed but for one .
general walther von seydlitz-kurzbach survived because he was by that time a russian prisoner of war .
baumann is pleased that parliament is about to close one of the last chapter 's of nazi military arbitrariness .
but that does not mean he has forgotten the past : “ it was such a horror , it hounds me to this very day . ” db / afp / dpa / epd editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .
i do n't see that as a big problem .

the country has to make sure students are literate , one expert told dw . as the world observes world literacy day , there are estimated to be 776 million people who are unable to read or write , according to the united nations .
that statistic led un secretary-general ban ki-moon to call for increased effort in the fight to end illiteracy . " in a world of enormous wealth and in a world where education and knowledge are the keys to a better life , the extent of global illiteracy is shocking , " he said .
" education gives people the tools they need to improve their living situation and take part in public decision making . " while the days of marking official documents with an " x " are long past for the vast majority of germans , not being able to read or write remains a problem that is growing more acute as jobs requiring few skills dry up , according to peter hubertus , the head of germany 's federal literacy association . " there are still people with limited reading and writing skills , and for a long time that has not been a large problem - even for the people who could not read or write at all , " he told deutsche welle .
" but the shift toward a knowledge-based society makes greater educational demands .
it 's clear that a person in germany in 2009 ca n't get by reading and writing at a first or second-grade level . " most functional illiterates attended school bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some students can write only at the most basic of levels hubertus estimated that there are 4 million illiterate people in germany with the reading and writing skills of a primary school student .
the majority of these people attended german schools , which he said posed a major problem for germany as students leave school frustrated and without sufficient basic skills . while numerous courses exist to teach young people how to read and write , it 's difficult to convince many of them how important these skills are . " there are a lot of courses , but we 're unable to reach many young adults , " hubertus said .
" young people tend to be so happy to be finished with school and no longer have to deal with writing .
when they leave school it 's hard to get them involved in a new learning process . " motivating kids to learn but in order for germany to maintain its position as an economic power , schools have to try to keep students from leaving without being able to read or write , according to michael huether , the director of a german economic research institute in cologne . the key to reaching young people is to disguise the learning process with issues they are already involved in , hubertus said , adding that fashion and music have proven to be areas where many illiterate or functionally illiterate teenagers want to make their opinions known . ideally , schools would identify learning deficiencies before kids reach their teens , hubertus said . " we have to strengthen kindergartens , provide better training for teachers and improve primary schools , " he said .
" there needs to be more individualized learning so students are supported step by step .
all this has to happen with topics that are interesting for each of the various age groups . " klaus gehrke -lrb- sms / dpa / ap -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with 91.6 percent of votes counted , president hamid karzai has an absolute majority of 54.1 percent . this is the first time that the figures show that president hamid karzai has enough votes to win in a single round and avoid a runoff poll .
figures released by afghanistan 's independent electoral commission -lrb- iec -rrb- give karzai a commanding lead with 54.1 percent , with 91.6 percent of all votes counted so far .
karzai 's nearest rival , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , is well behind with 28.3 percent .
nearly 5.5 million valid votes have been counted so far , the iec said .
karzai has 2,959,093 votes against abdullah 's 1,546,490 , the electoral commission announced at a news conference on tuesday .
the electoral commission announced on sunday that it had discarded around 200,000 ballots from 447 polling sites nationally where it had found vote fraud .

polling stations with suspiciously high voter participation , given a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , are also to be reviewed .
the low turnout , accredited to taliban voter intimidation and violence , is also threatening to cast doubt on the credibility of the process and the legitimacy of the winner .
preliminary results from 100 percent of votes cast across the country are expected to be announced on thursday .
karzai must have 50 percent of all ballots cast , plus one extra ballot , to be declared the winner .

with 91.6 percent of votes counted , president hamid karzai has an absolute majority of 54.1 percent . this is the first time that the figures show that president hamid karzai has enough votes to win in a single round and avoid a runoff poll .
figures released by afghanistan 's independent electoral commission -lrb- iec -rrb- give karzai a commanding lead with 54.1 percent , with 91.6 percent of all votes counted so far .
karzai 's nearest rival , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , is well behind with 28.3 percent .
nearly 5.5 million valid votes have been counted so far , the iec said .
karzai has 2,959,093 votes against abdullah 's 1,546,490 , the electoral commission announced at a news conference on tuesday .
the electoral commission announced on sunday that it had discarded around 200,000 ballots from 447 polling sites nationally where it had found vote fraud .

polling stations with suspiciously high voter participation , given a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , are also to be reviewed .
the low turnout , accredited to taliban voter intimidation and violence , is also threatening to cast doubt on the credibility of the process and the legitimacy of the winner .
preliminary results from 100 percent of votes cast across the country are expected to be announced on thursday .
karzai must have 50 percent of all ballots cast , plus one extra ballot , to be declared the winner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 08.09.2009 europe slams us plans for new tourist levy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility european travelers entering the us may be faced with a new levy in the future .
the plans by us lawmakers could trigger a trans-atlantic tit-for-tat response with travelers on both sides footing the bill . the european union has raised objections over us plans to introduce a $ 10 charge for travelers entering the us .
if the planned levy is deemed equivalent to a visa , eu lawmakers might decide to retaliate , by forcing entry-visas on us visitors to the 27-member bloc .
currently , 29 european countries are part of the us visa waiver program -lrb- among 35 countries worldwide -rrb- , permitting european tourists to enter the united states without a visa .
however , the us introduced an online registration process earlier this year , requiring european visitors to confirm their visa-free status , three days before their departure - a move that irritated eu officials in brussels at the time .
the european commission signaled that if the us changed the requirements of its electronic system for travel authorization -lrb- esta -rrb- , the eu might be forced to review its own position .
" the introduction of a fee by the us , would require a new assessment of the european commission ... to evaluate whether the esta system , is tantamount to a visa or not , " said commission spokesman michele cercone .
scanning for terrorists eu officials believe a fee would also discourage european visitors from registering online , which - as cercone argued - would undermine the security objectives of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe may retaliate if the us introduces its $ 10 levy " the introduction of such a fee would constitute a step backward in our joint endeavor to ease transatlantic mobility , " cercone said .
that argument resonates with european civil liberties groups , which see the electronic registration process - with or without a fee - as an invasion of privacy rights .
they say the us has no right to the personal information of eu citizens .
the us argues that information is crucial in the fight against terrorism .
washington says the system gives us intelligence officials a 72 hours ' heads-up ' if unwanted visitors -lrb- or would-be terrorists -rrb- are planning to travel to the us .
officials in brussels are reluctant to comment further , stressing the plan to introduce a $ 10 charge is still being debated in washington .
but other eu representatives have been less cautious .
" only in ' alice in wonderland ' could a penalty be seen as promoting the activity on which it is imposed , " the european commission 's ambassador to the united states , john bruton , said . other eu objections , especially in countries where credit cards are less widely used , include the question of how any levy would be paid .
there is a growing sense in brussels , that forcing europeans to pay $ 10 to enter the united states by credit card and online only discriminates against those visitors who neither use the internet nor possess a credit card .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility the $ 10 registration fee , which would last two years before having to be renewed , has been described by us lawmakers as ' nominal . '
they say the money generated by the registration fee , would go towards teaching visitors how to use the electronic registration process as well as other programs to promote travel to the us .
the weakest link another source of tension between the eu and us over the visa waiver program , involves the way the deal is negotiated .
eu officials argue washington should stop negotiating with individual eu countries bilaterally , and instead , work with the european union has a whole .
but washington insiders accuse the eu of hypocrisy , arguing that if eu unity is so important to the europeans , then individual countries benefiting from the visa waiver program should be prepared to give it up in solidarity with those eu member states that continue to be excluded .
us administration officials also insist there are live security threats in europe .
washington clearly views greece as problematic .
it is the only ' old ' eu member state which has been denied the visa waiver program .
us intelligence does not trust greek passport security and is unconvinced by athens ' commitment to fighting terrorism and extremists .
but brussels argues , no eu member state should be left in limbo - and negotiating with one eu country , should mean , negotiating with all .

but bosnian muslims feel excluded - they will have to wait longer for open borders .

the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumann 's death sentence became a prison sentence germany 's major political parties had first declined to support the current legislation because it was brought before parliament by the left party .
many of the party 's leading figures were once members of the communist party of former east germany .
the parties finally agreed to sponsor the bill when the left party removed itself from the list of backers .
arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .
but a justice ministry review headed by hans hugo klein , a former judge at the constitutional court , established that the nazis ' treason law was a merciless instrument of repression , and was so vague that it gave room to arbitrary rulings .
rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .
since then he has fought an uphill battle against prejudice and bureaucracy to see the records wiped clean .
he is the sole survivor of the group who initiated the association 20 years ago .
" i did n't want to be part of it any longer " baumann was an infantryman in occupied france when he deserted his regiment in 1942 .
he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .
his sentence was converted to 12 years imprisonment , and he was sent to the army prison in torgau , germany .
he survived , but when he returned to germany after the war , he found that the stigma of treason clung to him .
" i received many death threats .
we were treated like as cowards , scumbags and traitors .
no one was on our side . "
one group left to fight for it took years before opinion started to turn .
finally , in 1998 and 2002 , laws were passed that rehabilitated conscientious objectors , those found guilty of undermining the war effort , spies and deserters – among them baumann himself .
that left the small group of those charged with military treason - and baumann continued his battle on their behalf , despite the fact that his own honor had been restored .
according to baumann , 68 death sentences were handed down for wartime treason , and they were all executed but for one .
general walther von seydlitz-kurzbach survived because he was by that time a russian prisoner of war .

" every innocent person who is killed in afghanistan is one too many , " merkel told parliamentarians in berlin .
while promising a thorough investigation and a full report on the raid , which is believed to have left dozens of taliban militants as well as civilians dead , merkel slammed critics for drawing premature conclusions .
" i will ensure that we will not put a gloss on anything .
i will also ensure that we will not accept any premature judgments .
and having experienced what i have in recent days , i say very clearly : i will not take this from anyone , either here in germany or from abroad , " she said .
on saturday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner had called the airstrike a " big mistake . "
afghan president hamid karzai had told french daily le figaro in an interview published on monday that the attack was an " error of judgment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike targeted two fuel trucks that were hijacked by taliban militants " militarily necessary and correct " the german defense ministry on monday described the airstrike as " militarily necessary and correct " because it prevented the taliban from using the two hijacked fuel trucks as mobile bombs .
germany defense minister franz josef jung of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- has faced criticism over his information policy as well as calls for him to step down .
his ministry had initially said that the airstrike had only killed taliban militants .
however , on monday jung was forced to acknowledge that he could no longer rule out any civilian casualties , and on tuesday the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan indicated for the first time that civilians were probably killed in the attack , however , without providing any exact casualty figures .
" believing civilians were not in the area , the local isaf commander authorized an airstrike , which destroyed the two fuel trucks , " isaf said in a statement .
" subsequent review has led isaf to believe that along with insurgents , civilians also were killed and injured in the strike . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defence minister jung says the airstrike was necessary not an election campaign with all but one german political party supporting the government 's stance on the afghanistan mission , parliamentarians were quick to affirm on tuesday that the tragic incident would not be exploited as a campaign issue ahead of the sept .
27 national election .
the only party in the bundestag calling for the immediate withdrawal of germany 's 4,200 troops is the left party .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " oskar lafontaine , the co-leader of the opposition left told parliament on tuesday .
however , the left party and its leaders have a reputation in germany for demanding what is currently popular rather than politically expedient .
even before the airstrike controversy , a poll in july showed that up to 69 percent of germans wanted their soldiers to pull out of afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 08.09.2009 corrupt political elites block development in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's corrupt political elites are leaving their people to suffer african leaders are responsible for the problems in their countries , and not former colonial powers .
development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .

talking to deutsche welle chairman piet van assche confirms that their approach is different : " in almost 30 years in benin we never took any initiative of our own .
we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .
but the author distinguishes between rich and poor .
" i do n't condemn the policeman , who collects a bribe on the side of the road .
i do n't condemn the poor , who are often desperate to survive .
i condemn the political elites , who do n't give a damn about the people . "
paul banoba from transparency international in berlin , which studies and fights corruption worldwide , disagrees .
" you can not just blame the top , " he says in an interview with deutsche welle .
" in comparing corrupt policemen with corrupt politicians volker seitz may want to make a distinction between petty corruption and large-scale corruption .

he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .

development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "
his advice is that , " we should support independent african solutions only . "

we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 08.09.2009 german analyst plays down trans-atlantic rift over airstrike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of germans in afghanistan is a bone of contention a nato airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan 's kunduz province may have sparked a rift between berlin and washington .
one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .
i do n't see that as a big problem .

one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .
i do n't see that as a big problem .

he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 08.09.2009 german analyst plays down trans-atlantic rift over airstrike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of germans in afghanistan is a bone of contention a nato airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan 's kunduz province may have sparked a rift between berlin and washington .
one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .

one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 08.09.2009 corrupt political elites block development in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's corrupt political elites are leaving their people to suffer african leaders are responsible for the problems in their countries , and not former colonial powers .
development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "
his advice is that , " we should support independent african solutions only . "
exception to the rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benin 's president , thomas yayi boni , has tried to crack down on corruption that is exactly what hubi and vinciane , a small belgian aid organisation , does in the republic of benin .
talking to deutsche welle chairman piet van assche confirms that their approach is different : " in almost 30 years in benin we never took any initiative of our own .
we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .
but the author distinguishes between rich and poor .
" i do n't condemn the policeman , who collects a bribe on the side of the road .
i do n't condemn the poor , who are often desperate to survive .
i condemn the political elites , who do n't give a damn about the people . "
paul banoba from transparency international in berlin , which studies and fights corruption worldwide , disagrees .
" you can not just blame the top , " he says in an interview with deutsche welle .
" in comparing corrupt policemen with corrupt politicians volker seitz may want to make a distinction between petty corruption and large-scale corruption .
but we define corruption as an evil in itself , at whatever level it occurs .
there is corruption at every level , it is widespread . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money makes the world go round especially for africa 's political elites it 's not easy to talk about corruption .
doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , which is represented in nearly all african countries , turned down deutsche welle 's interview request , arguing that , " msf is not involved in corruption , never deals with officials who expect a personal benefit and therefore hardly can answer the questions .
msf is neutral and does not officially blame others without being involved itself . "
piet van assche from hubi and vinciane says his company has managed to stay clear of any allegations of corruption : " to my knowledge we 've never had anything to do with corruption . "
democracy and its many faces van assche says that the transition of power in benin has gone smoothly since he started working there in the mid-eighties .
but volker seitz warns that european democracy does n't always fit into an african environment : " it 's difficult to transfer our western parliamentarian system to africa .
what counts is the political will to improve the standard of living .
education is important .
human rights must be respected .
those things , i believe , are not negotiable , but it does n't have to be parliamentarian democracy as we know it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.09.2009 ruettgers ' romania slur meant to placate the far right , author says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers relies on inflammatory rhetoric , according to georgescu romanian-born writer vlad georgescu has filed charges of sedition and defamation against the premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia .
he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .
i do n't see that as a big problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.09.2009 ruettgers ' romania slur meant to placate the far right , author says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers relies on inflammatory rhetoric , according to georgescu romanian-born writer vlad georgescu has filed charges of sedition and defamation against the premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia .
he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 08.09.2009 brazil to boost its military standing with strategic french partnership deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil hopes to profit from its strategic partnership with france french president nicolas sarkozy has signed a deal deepening military ties with brazil .
the strategic partnership between both countries was first launched last year and gives brazil more clout in latin america . the partnership covers the production of 50 helicopters , four conventional submarines and the development of the first brazilian nuclear submarine , even though the contract explicitly excludes the transfer of french nuclear know-how .
there are also investments planned in industrial and harbour facilities .
the project will cost the brazilian government around 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.4 billion -rrb- and will be financed by a consortium made up of six european banks .
the military cooperation includes the purchase of 36 french fighter planes , a deal that will give brazil one of the most advanced combat aircraft in latin america .
a valuable investment ?
however , german defence experts are sceptical about the military cooperation .
they believe the billion-euro treaty , which will boost brazil 's military capacity , could trigger an arms race on the continent , without bringing the advantages , which the brazilian government expects .
" right now it is hard to say whether this project will be successful indeed from a technological perspective and whether it will give brazil military advantages compared to other countries .
an ambitious project like this can also turn out to be a failure , " says ottfried nassauer , who is the head of the berlin information center for transatlantic security .
according to nassauer the cooperation with france should not cause any concern for the neighboring countries , as the understanding among the governments on the continent is good .
but he thinks that the money could be invested better elsewhere .
" the question which luiz inacio lula da silva 's government should ask is whether the investments are not too high and whether it is worth it , to spend such large amounts of money for its own political and military status .
there are many other social and economical fields , where the same kind of money most likely would create many more jobs and possibly lead to more transfer of technology .
military technology always costs more than civil technology , " says nassauer .
regional predominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bilateral deal could anger some of brazil 's regional neighbors political scientist daniel flemes , who is an expert for defence politics with the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg , fears that the cooperation with france can cause problems for the cooperation with latin american neighbors and lead to a regional arms race .
" the fact that brazil gains technological know-how out of partnerships outside of latin america , could trigger an arms race on the continent and hinder defence cooperation with the neighbouring countries , " flemes says .

the strategic partnership between both countries was first launched last year and gives brazil more clout in latin america . the partnership covers the production of 50 helicopters , four conventional submarines and the development of the first brazilian nuclear submarine , even though the contract explicitly excludes the transfer of french nuclear know-how .
there are also investments planned in industrial and harbour facilities .
the project will cost the brazilian government around 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.4 billion -rrb- and will be financed by a consortium made up of six european banks .
the military cooperation includes the purchase of 36 french fighter planes , a deal that will give brazil one of the most advanced combat aircraft in latin america .
a valuable investment ?
however , german defence experts are sceptical about the military cooperation .
they believe the billion-euro treaty , which will boost brazil 's military capacity , could trigger an arms race on the continent , without bringing the advantages , which the brazilian government expects .
" right now it is hard to say whether this project will be successful indeed from a technological perspective and whether it will give brazil military advantages compared to other countries .
an ambitious project like this can also turn out to be a failure , " says ottfried nassauer , who is the head of the berlin information center for transatlantic security .
according to nassauer the cooperation with france should not cause any concern for the neighboring countries , as the understanding among the governments on the continent is good .
but he thinks that the money could be invested better elsewhere .
" the question which luiz inacio lula da silva 's government should ask is whether the investments are not too high and whether it is worth it , to spend such large amounts of money for its own political and military status .
there are many other social and economical fields , where the same kind of money most likely would create many more jobs and possibly lead to more transfer of technology .
military technology always costs more than civil technology , " says nassauer .
regional predominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bilateral deal could anger some of brazil 's regional neighbors political scientist daniel flemes , who is an expert for defence politics with the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg , fears that the cooperation with france can cause problems for the cooperation with latin american neighbors and lead to a regional arms race .
" the fact that brazil gains technological know-how out of partnerships outside of latin america , could trigger an arms race on the continent and hinder defence cooperation with the neighbouring countries , " flemes says .
he believes that brazil not only wants to secure its regional predominance with the contract , but is also striving to become a super power . " the country is trying to stabilise its regional predominance , not only on an economical and political , but on a military level as well .

" every innocent person who is killed in afghanistan is one too many , " merkel told parliamentarians in berlin .
while promising a thorough investigation and a full report on the raid , which is believed to have left dozens of taliban militants as well as civilians dead , merkel slammed critics for drawing premature conclusions .
" i will ensure that we will not put a gloss on anything .
i will also ensure that we will not accept any premature judgments .
and having experienced what i have in recent days , i say very clearly : i will not take this from anyone , either here in germany or from abroad , " she said .
on saturday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner had called the airstrike a " big mistake . "
afghan president hamid karzai had told french daily le figaro in an interview published on monday that the attack was an " error of judgment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike targeted two fuel trucks that were hijacked by taliban militants " militarily necessary and correct " the german defense ministry on monday described the airstrike as " militarily necessary and correct " because it prevented the taliban from using the two hijacked fuel trucks as mobile bombs .
germany defense minister franz josef jung of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- has faced criticism over his information policy as well as calls for him to step down .
his ministry had initially said that the airstrike had only killed taliban militants .
however , on monday jung was forced to acknowledge that he could no longer rule out any civilian casualties , and on tuesday the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan indicated for the first time that civilians were probably killed in the attack , however , without providing any exact casualty figures .
" believing civilians were not in the area , the local isaf commander authorized an airstrike , which destroyed the two fuel trucks , " isaf said in a statement .
" subsequent review has led isaf to believe that along with insurgents , civilians also were killed and injured in the strike . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defence minister jung says the airstrike was necessary not an election campaign with all but one german political party supporting the government 's stance on the afghanistan mission , parliamentarians were quick to affirm on tuesday that the tragic incident would not be exploited as a campaign issue ahead of the sept .
27 national election .
the only party in the bundestag calling for the immediate withdrawal of germany 's 4,200 troops is the left party .

but decisions over details of the new monument in berlin have caused some controversy . the monument , which bears the inscription " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom , " is located near the headquarters of the defense ministry in berlin .
some critics have said it should be located closer to germany 's parliament building - in a different part of the city - as the german army is officially the parliament 's army .
" the soldiers would have picked out another place for their monument .
they would have wanted it to be in a more prominent place , such as near the reichstag building , " said reinhold robbe , the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces .
" in the end , only the parliament decides when and where soldiers are going to be sent to serve . "
the german army , or bundeswehr , was founded in 1955 , and to date , around 3,100 service members have died while in active duty .
manner of death an issue although the monument 's opening comes at a time when a growing number of german soldiers are being killed in afghanistan , the monument does not differentiate between soldiers and civilian employees of the army who lost their lives due to accidents or suicide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meck and a model of his memorial reinhard fuerher is the president of the german war graves commission and thinks a distinction should be made .
" there 's a big difference between someone in the bundeswehr who is killed because of a careless accident and someone who was sent by the german parliament into a war-like situation , " fuerher said .
" accidents , suicide - it 's all a part of this , " counters robbe .
" for the loved ones of a dead soldier it 's still a bad thing when someone loses their life . "
a modern memorial the plans for a monument for german soldiers killed in service has been around for some time .
the idea came to defense minister franz-josef jung during a visit to afghanistan in 2005 .
there , german soldiers had erected their own monument to their fallen comrades .
despite criticism from members of parliament , jung has always been adamant that the memorial be placed near the headquarters of the bundeswehr .
while the location and the exact meaning of the monument have led to debate , the monument itself has been widely accepted .
munich-based architect andreas meck is the architect of the memorial and presented his plan in 2007 .
construction officially began with a groundbreaking ceremony last november .
the final structure is about 40 meters -lrb- 131 feet -rrb- long and is supported by columns .
a computer screen cycles through the names of dead soldiers , briefly displaying each one before blending in the next .

" every innocent person who is killed in afghanistan is one too many , " merkel told parliamentarians in berlin .
while promising a thorough investigation and a full report on the raid , which is believed to have left dozens of taliban militants as well as civilians dead , merkel slammed critics for drawing premature conclusions .
" i will ensure that we will not put a gloss on anything .
i will also ensure that we will not accept any premature judgments .
and having experienced what i have in recent days , i say very clearly : i will not take this from anyone , either here in germany or from abroad , " she said .
on saturday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner had called the airstrike a " big mistake . "
afghan president hamid karzai had told french daily le figaro in an interview published on monday that the attack was an " error of judgment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike targeted two fuel trucks that were hijacked by taliban militants " militarily necessary and correct " the german defense ministry on monday described the airstrike as " militarily necessary and correct " because it prevented the taliban from using the two hijacked fuel trucks as mobile bombs .
germany defense minister franz josef jung of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- has faced criticism over his information policy as well as calls for him to step down .
his ministry had initially said that the airstrike had only killed taliban militants .
however , on monday jung was forced to acknowledge that he could no longer rule out any civilian casualties , and on tuesday the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan indicated for the first time that civilians were probably killed in the attack , however , without providing any exact casualty figures .
" believing civilians were not in the area , the local isaf commander authorized an airstrike , which destroyed the two fuel trucks , " isaf said in a statement .
" subsequent review has led isaf to believe that along with insurgents , civilians also were killed and injured in the strike . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defence minister jung says the airstrike was necessary not an election campaign with all but one german political party supporting the government 's stance on the afghanistan mission , parliamentarians were quick to affirm on tuesday that the tragic incident would not be exploited as a campaign issue ahead of the sept .
27 national election .
the only party in the bundestag calling for the immediate withdrawal of germany 's 4,200 troops is the left party .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " oskar lafontaine , the co-leader of the opposition left told parliament on tuesday .
however , the left party and its leaders have a reputation in germany for demanding what is currently popular rather than politically expedient .
even before the airstrike controversy , a poll in july showed that up to 69 percent of germans wanted their soldiers to pull out of afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine , co-leader of the left party , wants germany out of afghanistan government remains committed despite the german public 's reservations over the afghanistan mission , the chancellor has refrained from giving any pullout date for german forces , and she also sidestepped the issue during her speech on tuesday .
instead , merkel drew attention to what had brought international forces to the war-torn country in the first place .
" it was afghanistan , controlled by the taliban and al qaeda , that was the breeding ground for the terror of september 11 , " merkel said .
" the september 11 attacks were followed by dreadful attacks in europe - in madrid and in london .
we know too that germany is in their sights ...
the engagement in afghanistan is our reaction to terror .
that 's where it came from , not the other way around . "
merkel also referred to a joint german-british-franco proposal for an international conference this year to pressure the afghan government to take on more responsibilities , enabling the withdrawal of coalition forces .
" for germany , britain and france , this conference is about creating the conditions for developing an internationally agreed handover strategy , " merkel said on tuesday .
" our overriding political goal is and remains an afghanistan that can handle its own security . "
it was unclear where and when the conference would be held , but the united nations , which is to host the event , has proposed kabul as the venue. nk / reuters / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but decisions over details of the new monument in berlin have caused some controversy . the monument , which bears the inscription " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom , " is located near the headquarters of the defense ministry in berlin .
some critics have said it should be located closer to germany 's parliament building - in a different part of the city - as the german army is officially the parliament 's army .
" the soldiers would have picked out another place for their monument .
they would have wanted it to be in a more prominent place , such as near the reichstag building , " said reinhold robbe , the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces .
" in the end , only the parliament decides when and where soldiers are going to be sent to serve . "

" for the loved ones of a dead soldier it 's still a bad thing when someone loses their life . "
a modern memorial the plans for a monument for german soldiers killed in service has been around for some time .
the idea came to defense minister franz-josef jung during a visit to afghanistan in 2005 .
there , german soldiers had erected their own monument to their fallen comrades .
despite criticism from members of parliament , jung has always been adamant that the memorial be placed near the headquarters of the bundeswehr .

the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumann 's death sentence became a prison sentence germany 's major political parties had first declined to support the current legislation because it was brought before parliament by the left party .
many of the party 's leading figures were once members of the communist party of former east germany .
the parties finally agreed to sponsor the bill when the left party removed itself from the list of backers .
arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .
but a justice ministry review headed by hans hugo klein , a former judge at the constitutional court , established that the nazis ' treason law was a merciless instrument of repression , and was so vague that it gave room to arbitrary rulings .
rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .
since then he has fought an uphill battle against prejudice and bureaucracy to see the records wiped clean .
he is the sole survivor of the group who initiated the association 20 years ago .
" i did n't want to be part of it any longer " baumann was an infantryman in occupied france when he deserted his regiment in 1942 .
he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .
his sentence was converted to 12 years imprisonment , and he was sent to the army prison in torgau , germany .
he survived , but when he returned to germany after the war , he found that the stigma of treason clung to him .
" i received many death threats .
we were treated like as cowards , scumbags and traitors .
no one was on our side . "
one group left to fight for it took years before opinion started to turn .
finally , in 1998 and 2002 , laws were passed that rehabilitated conscientious objectors , those found guilty of undermining the war effort , spies and deserters – among them baumann himself .
that left the small group of those charged with military treason - and baumann continued his battle on their behalf , despite the fact that his own honor had been restored .
according to baumann , 68 death sentences were handed down for wartime treason , and they were all executed but for one .
general walther von seydlitz-kurzbach survived because he was by that time a russian prisoner of war .
baumann is pleased that parliament is about to close one of the last chapter 's of nazi military arbitrariness .

the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumann 's death sentence became a prison sentence germany 's major political parties had first declined to support the current legislation because it was brought before parliament by the left party .
many of the party 's leading figures were once members of the communist party of former east germany .
the parties finally agreed to sponsor the bill when the left party removed itself from the list of backers .
arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .
but a justice ministry review headed by hans hugo klein , a former judge at the constitutional court , established that the nazis ' treason law was a merciless instrument of repression , and was so vague that it gave room to arbitrary rulings .
rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .
since then he has fought an uphill battle against prejudice and bureaucracy to see the records wiped clean .
he is the sole survivor of the group who initiated the association 20 years ago .
" i did n't want to be part of it any longer " baumann was an infantryman in occupied france when he deserted his regiment in 1942 .
he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .
his sentence was converted to 12 years imprisonment , and he was sent to the army prison in torgau , germany .
he survived , but when he returned to germany after the war , he found that the stigma of treason clung to him .
" i received many death threats .
we were treated like as cowards , scumbags and traitors .
no one was on our side . "
one group left to fight for it took years before opinion started to turn .
finally , in 1998 and 2002 , laws were passed that rehabilitated conscientious objectors , those found guilty of undermining the war effort , spies and deserters – among them baumann himself .
that left the small group of those charged with military treason - and baumann continued his battle on their behalf , despite the fact that his own honor had been restored .
according to baumann , 68 death sentences were handed down for wartime treason , and they were all executed but for one .
general walther von seydlitz-kurzbach survived because he was by that time a russian prisoner of war .
baumann is pleased that parliament is about to close one of the last chapter 's of nazi military arbitrariness .

the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumann 's death sentence became a prison sentence germany 's major political parties had first declined to support the current legislation because it was brought before parliament by the left party .
many of the party 's leading figures were once members of the communist party of former east germany .
the parties finally agreed to sponsor the bill when the left party removed itself from the list of backers .
arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .
but a justice ministry review headed by hans hugo klein , a former judge at the constitutional court , established that the nazis ' treason law was a merciless instrument of repression , and was so vague that it gave room to arbitrary rulings .
rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .
since then he has fought an uphill battle against prejudice and bureaucracy to see the records wiped clean .
he is the sole survivor of the group who initiated the association 20 years ago .
" i did n't want to be part of it any longer " baumann was an infantryman in occupied france when he deserted his regiment in 1942 .
he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .
his sentence was converted to 12 years imprisonment , and he was sent to the army prison in torgau , germany .
he survived , but when he returned to germany after the war , he found that the stigma of treason clung to him .
" i received many death threats .
we were treated like as cowards , scumbags and traitors .
no one was on our side . "
one group left to fight for it took years before opinion started to turn .
finally , in 1998 and 2002 , laws were passed that rehabilitated conscientious objectors , those found guilty of undermining the war effort , spies and deserters – among them baumann himself .
that left the small group of those charged with military treason - and baumann continued his battle on their behalf , despite the fact that his own honor had been restored .

the plans by us lawmakers could trigger a trans-atlantic tit-for-tat response with travelers on both sides footing the bill . the european union has raised objections over us plans to introduce a $ 10 charge for travelers entering the us .
if the planned levy is deemed equivalent to a visa , eu lawmakers might decide to retaliate , by forcing entry-visas on us visitors to the 27-member bloc .
currently , 29 european countries are part of the us visa waiver program -lrb- among 35 countries worldwide -rrb- , permitting european tourists to enter the united states without a visa .
however , the us introduced an online registration process earlier this year , requiring european visitors to confirm their visa-free status , three days before their departure - a move that irritated eu officials in brussels at the time .
the european commission signaled that if the us changed the requirements of its electronic system for travel authorization -lrb- esta -rrb- , the eu might be forced to review its own position .
" the introduction of a fee by the us , would require a new assessment of the european commission ... to evaluate whether the esta system , is tantamount to a visa or not , " said commission spokesman michele cercone .
scanning for terrorists eu officials believe a fee would also discourage european visitors from registering online , which - as cercone argued - would undermine the security objectives of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe may retaliate if the us introduces its $ 10 levy " the introduction of such a fee would constitute a step backward in our joint endeavor to ease transatlantic mobility , " cercone said .
that argument resonates with european civil liberties groups , which see the electronic registration process - with or without a fee - as an invasion of privacy rights .
they say the us has no right to the personal information of eu citizens .
the us argues that information is crucial in the fight against terrorism .
washington says the system gives us intelligence officials a 72 hours ' heads-up ' if unwanted visitors -lrb- or would-be terrorists -rrb- are planning to travel to the us .
officials in brussels are reluctant to comment further , stressing the plan to introduce a $ 10 charge is still being debated in washington .
but other eu representatives have been less cautious .
" only in ' alice in wonderland ' could a penalty be seen as promoting the activity on which it is imposed , " the european commission 's ambassador to the united states , john bruton , said . other eu objections , especially in countries where credit cards are less widely used , include the question of how any levy would be paid .
there is a growing sense in brussels , that forcing europeans to pay $ 10 to enter the united states by credit card and online only discriminates against those visitors who neither use the internet nor possess a credit card .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility the $ 10 registration fee , which would last two years before having to be renewed , has been described by us lawmakers as ' nominal . '
they say the money generated by the registration fee , would go towards teaching visitors how to use the electronic registration process as well as other programs to promote travel to the us .
the weakest link another source of tension between the eu and us over the visa waiver program , involves the way the deal is negotiated .
eu officials argue washington should stop negotiating with individual eu countries bilaterally , and instead , work with the european union has a whole .
but washington insiders accuse the eu of hypocrisy , arguing that if eu unity is so important to the europeans , then individual countries benefiting from the visa waiver program should be prepared to give it up in solidarity with those eu member states that continue to be excluded .
us administration officials also insist there are live security threats in europe .
washington clearly views greece as problematic .
it is the only ' old ' eu member state which has been denied the visa waiver program .
us intelligence does not trust greek passport security and is unconvinced by athens ' commitment to fighting terrorism and extremists .
but brussels argues , no eu member state should be left in limbo - and negotiating with one eu country , should mean , negotiating with all .

the plans by us lawmakers could trigger a trans-atlantic tit-for-tat response with travelers on both sides footing the bill . the european union has raised objections over us plans to introduce a $ 10 charge for travelers entering the us .
if the planned levy is deemed equivalent to a visa , eu lawmakers might decide to retaliate , by forcing entry-visas on us visitors to the 27-member bloc .
currently , 29 european countries are part of the us visa waiver program -lrb- among 35 countries worldwide -rrb- , permitting european tourists to enter the united states without a visa .
however , the us introduced an online registration process earlier this year , requiring european visitors to confirm their visa-free status , three days before their departure - a move that irritated eu officials in brussels at the time .
the european commission signaled that if the us changed the requirements of its electronic system for travel authorization -lrb- esta -rrb- , the eu might be forced to review its own position .
" the introduction of a fee by the us , would require a new assessment of the european commission ... to evaluate whether the esta system , is tantamount to a visa or not , " said commission spokesman michele cercone .
scanning for terrorists eu officials believe a fee would also discourage european visitors from registering online , which - as cercone argued - would undermine the security objectives of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe may retaliate if the us introduces its $ 10 levy " the introduction of such a fee would constitute a step backward in our joint endeavor to ease transatlantic mobility , " cercone said .
that argument resonates with european civil liberties groups , which see the electronic registration process - with or without a fee - as an invasion of privacy rights .
they say the us has no right to the personal information of eu citizens .
the us argues that information is crucial in the fight against terrorism .
washington says the system gives us intelligence officials a 72 hours ' heads-up ' if unwanted visitors -lrb- or would-be terrorists -rrb- are planning to travel to the us .
officials in brussels are reluctant to comment further , stressing the plan to introduce a $ 10 charge is still being debated in washington .
but other eu representatives have been less cautious .
" only in ' alice in wonderland ' could a penalty be seen as promoting the activity on which it is imposed , " the european commission 's ambassador to the united states , john bruton , said . other eu objections , especially in countries where credit cards are less widely used , include the question of how any levy would be paid .
there is a growing sense in brussels , that forcing europeans to pay $ 10 to enter the united states by credit card and online only discriminates against those visitors who neither use the internet nor possess a credit card .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility the $ 10 registration fee , which would last two years before having to be renewed , has been described by us lawmakers as ' nominal . '
they say the money generated by the registration fee , would go towards teaching visitors how to use the electronic registration process as well as other programs to promote travel to the us .
the weakest link another source of tension between the eu and us over the visa waiver program , involves the way the deal is negotiated .
eu officials argue washington should stop negotiating with individual eu countries bilaterally , and instead , work with the european union has a whole .
but washington insiders accuse the eu of hypocrisy , arguing that if eu unity is so important to the europeans , then individual countries benefiting from the visa waiver program should be prepared to give it up in solidarity with those eu member states that continue to be excluded .
us administration officials also insist there are live security threats in europe .
washington clearly views greece as problematic .
it is the only ' old ' eu member state which has been denied the visa waiver program .
us intelligence does not trust greek passport security and is unconvinced by athens ' commitment to fighting terrorism and extremists .
but brussels argues , no eu member state should be left in limbo - and negotiating with one eu country , should mean , negotiating with all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 08.09.2009 brazil to boost its military standing with strategic french partnership deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil hopes to profit from its strategic partnership with france french president nicolas sarkozy has signed a deal deepening military ties with brazil .
the strategic partnership between both countries was first launched last year and gives brazil more clout in latin america . the partnership covers the production of 50 helicopters , four conventional submarines and the development of the first brazilian nuclear submarine , even though the contract explicitly excludes the transfer of french nuclear know-how .
there are also investments planned in industrial and harbour facilities .
the project will cost the brazilian government around 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.4 billion -rrb- and will be financed by a consortium made up of six european banks .
the military cooperation includes the purchase of 36 french fighter planes , a deal that will give brazil one of the most advanced combat aircraft in latin america .
a valuable investment ?
however , german defence experts are sceptical about the military cooperation .
they believe the billion-euro treaty , which will boost brazil 's military capacity , could trigger an arms race on the continent , without bringing the advantages , which the brazilian government expects .
" right now it is hard to say whether this project will be successful indeed from a technological perspective and whether it will give brazil military advantages compared to other countries .
an ambitious project like this can also turn out to be a failure , " says ottfried nassauer , who is the head of the berlin information center for transatlantic security .
according to nassauer the cooperation with france should not cause any concern for the neighboring countries , as the understanding among the governments on the continent is good .
but he thinks that the money could be invested better elsewhere .
" the question which luiz inacio lula da silva 's government should ask is whether the investments are not too high and whether it is worth it , to spend such large amounts of money for its own political and military status .
there are many other social and economical fields , where the same kind of money most likely would create many more jobs and possibly lead to more transfer of technology .
military technology always costs more than civil technology , " says nassauer .
regional predominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bilateral deal could anger some of brazil 's regional neighbors political scientist daniel flemes , who is an expert for defence politics with the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg , fears that the cooperation with france can cause problems for the cooperation with latin american neighbors and lead to a regional arms race .
" the fact that brazil gains technological know-how out of partnerships outside of latin america , could trigger an arms race on the continent and hinder defence cooperation with the neighbouring countries , " flemes says .
he believes that brazil not only wants to secure its regional predominance with the contract , but is also striving to become a super power . " the country is trying to stabilise its regional predominance , not only on an economical and political , but on a military level as well .
simultaneously it wishes to expand its influence as an emerging country internationally , " flemes says .
but he also thinks brazil 's ambitions are a natural development , as some of its neighbors are expanding their military strength as well .
" some neighboring countries are modernising their military infrastructure .
venezuela spent four billion euros in the last four or five years on arms imports from russia .
also chile has increased its defence budget over the past years .
so brazil does n't stand alone with its military investments .
over the past five years time the total amount of defence expenditure in south america has more than doubled , " say flemes .

retaining control the head of a pro-business group in chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union , kurt lauk , said gm is unlikely to sell opel to magna because detroit did n't want to pass valuable intellectual property on to magna 's russian partner sberbank .
“ should the russians become co-owners of opel , they 'll get much quicker access to gm 's small-car technology , ” lauk told bloomberg news agency on tuesday .
“ i 'm convinced that would pose a fundamental problem to the new board . ”
lauk , who is also a former board member of daimlerchrysler and audi , said it would be “ commercially wise ” for gm to dismiss both bids and keep opel for itself , using a “ restructuring plan ” to secure the us giant 's presence in the european and russian markets .
softening stance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm is unhappy with magna 's ties to russian bank sberbank recent media reports suggest the german government may have softened its stance on the prospect of gm retaining control of opel .

german deputy economy minister jochen homann said tuesday that gm would need to present a robust business strategy if it wanted to keep opel .
" ' we are keeping opel ' is not a strategy yet , " he said on the sidelines of an energy conference .
" we have laid the groundwork in the direction of magna , " homann said , reiterating the german government 's support for a deal with magna. sje / afp / dpa / reuters editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 08.09.2009 europe slams us plans for new tourist levy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility european travelers entering the us may be faced with a new levy in the future .
the plans by us lawmakers could trigger a trans-atlantic tit-for-tat response with travelers on both sides footing the bill . the european union has raised objections over us plans to introduce a $ 10 charge for travelers entering the us .
if the planned levy is deemed equivalent to a visa , eu lawmakers might decide to retaliate , by forcing entry-visas on us visitors to the 27-member bloc .
currently , 29 european countries are part of the us visa waiver program -lrb- among 35 countries worldwide -rrb- , permitting european tourists to enter the united states without a visa .
however , the us introduced an online registration process earlier this year , requiring european visitors to confirm their visa-free status , three days before their departure - a move that irritated eu officials in brussels at the time .
the european commission signaled that if the us changed the requirements of its electronic system for travel authorization -lrb- esta -rrb- , the eu might be forced to review its own position .
" the introduction of a fee by the us , would require a new assessment of the european commission ... to evaluate whether the esta system , is tantamount to a visa or not , " said commission spokesman michele cercone .
scanning for terrorists eu officials believe a fee would also discourage european visitors from registering online , which - as cercone argued - would undermine the security objectives of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe may retaliate if the us introduces its $ 10 levy " the introduction of such a fee would constitute a step backward in our joint endeavor to ease transatlantic mobility , " cercone said .
that argument resonates with european civil liberties groups , which see the electronic registration process - with or without a fee - as an invasion of privacy rights .
they say the us has no right to the personal information of eu citizens .
the us argues that information is crucial in the fight against terrorism .
washington says the system gives us intelligence officials a 72 hours ' heads-up ' if unwanted visitors -lrb- or would-be terrorists -rrb- are planning to travel to the us .
officials in brussels are reluctant to comment further , stressing the plan to introduce a $ 10 charge is still being debated in washington .
but other eu representatives have been less cautious .
" only in ' alice in wonderland ' could a penalty be seen as promoting the activity on which it is imposed , " the european commission 's ambassador to the united states , john bruton , said . other eu objections , especially in countries where credit cards are less widely used , include the question of how any levy would be paid .
there is a growing sense in brussels , that forcing europeans to pay $ 10 to enter the united states by credit card and online only discriminates against those visitors who neither use the internet nor possess a credit card .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility the $ 10 registration fee , which would last two years before having to be renewed , has been described by us lawmakers as ' nominal . '
they say the money generated by the registration fee , would go towards teaching visitors how to use the electronic registration process as well as other programs to promote travel to the us .
the weakest link another source of tension between the eu and us over the visa waiver program , involves the way the deal is negotiated .
eu officials argue washington should stop negotiating with individual eu countries bilaterally , and instead , work with the european union has a whole .
but washington insiders accuse the eu of hypocrisy , arguing that if eu unity is so important to the europeans , then individual countries benefiting from the visa waiver program should be prepared to give it up in solidarity with those eu member states that continue to be excluded .
us administration officials also insist there are live security threats in europe .
washington clearly views greece as problematic .
it is the only ' old ' eu member state which has been denied the visa waiver program .
us intelligence does not trust greek passport security and is unconvinced by athens ' commitment to fighting terrorism and extremists .
but brussels argues , no eu member state should be left in limbo - and negotiating with one eu country , should mean , negotiating with all .

karzai 's nearest rival , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , is well behind with 28.3 percent .
nearly 5.5 million valid votes have been counted so far , the iec said .
karzai has 2,959,093 votes against abdullah 's 1,546,490 , the electoral commission announced at a news conference on tuesday .
the electoral commission announced on sunday that it had discarded around 200,000 ballots from 447 polling sites nationally where it had found vote fraud .
partial recount ordered on tuesday , the un-backed independent election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- said it too had clear evidence of fraud in the election . the body said it received more than 2,000 complaints , about a third of which could impact the final result .
" in the course of its investigations , the election complaints commission has found clear and convincing evidence of fraud in a number of polling stations , " the ecc said in a statement .
it did not say which candidate gained from the fraud , or where the suspicious ballots had been cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans voted amid taliban threats of violence the ecc has ordered the electoral commission to review votes from 600 more polling stations .
these include stations where a single candidate received more than 95 percent of the votes and those where more than 600 votes were cast , the most that could be cast a single station .
polling stations with suspiciously high voter participation , given a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , are also to be reviewed .
the low turnout , accredited to taliban voter intimidation and violence , is also threatening to cast doubt on the credibility of the process and the legitimacy of the winner .
preliminary results from 100 percent of votes cast across the country are expected to be announced on thursday .
karzai must have 50 percent of all ballots cast , plus one extra ballot , to be declared the winner .
final official results are not due before sept .

with 91.6 percent of votes counted , president hamid karzai has an absolute majority of 54.1 percent . this is the first time that the figures show that president hamid karzai has enough votes to win in a single round and avoid a runoff poll .
figures released by afghanistan 's independent electoral commission -lrb- iec -rrb- give karzai a commanding lead with 54.1 percent , with 91.6 percent of all votes counted so far .
karzai 's nearest rival , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , is well behind with 28.3 percent .
nearly 5.5 million valid votes have been counted so far , the iec said .
karzai has 2,959,093 votes against abdullah 's 1,546,490 , the electoral commission announced at a news conference on tuesday .
the electoral commission announced on sunday that it had discarded around 200,000 ballots from 447 polling sites nationally where it had found vote fraud .
partial recount ordered on tuesday , the un-backed independent election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- said it too had clear evidence of fraud in the election . the body said it received more than 2,000 complaints , about a third of which could impact the final result .
" in the course of its investigations , the election complaints commission has found clear and convincing evidence of fraud in a number of polling stations , " the ecc said in a statement .
it did not say which candidate gained from the fraud , or where the suspicious ballots had been cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans voted amid taliban threats of violence the ecc has ordered the electoral commission to review votes from 600 more polling stations .
these include stations where a single candidate received more than 95 percent of the votes and those where more than 600 votes were cast , the most that could be cast a single station .
polling stations with suspiciously high voter participation , given a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , are also to be reviewed .
the low turnout , accredited to taliban voter intimidation and violence , is also threatening to cast doubt on the credibility of the process and the legitimacy of the winner .
preliminary results from 100 percent of votes cast across the country are expected to be announced on thursday .
karzai must have 50 percent of all ballots cast , plus one extra ballot , to be declared the winner .
final official results are not due before sept .

the young artist who organized the market is collecting her customers ' private tales for a radio play . for a modest polka-dotted dress in green and white you 'll have to spend 10 minutes talking about morals and chastity .
a necklace is worth five minutes about a dirty little secret .
and for three books , you 'll have to tell something you 've never told anyone before . " of course , i am curious , " said 26-year-old alexandra mueller , the instigator and organizer of the berlin 's so-called " intimate flea market . " each conversation is recorded and will later be woven together dramaturgically into a radio play .
the moments she enjoys the most are when her conversation partners forget she is there and just keep talking to themselves . give and take " i do n't think i 'll ever manage to have functioning relationships , " said a girl who wanted to be called sonja .
the price tag on the green cap she was " paying for " called for six minutes about a breakup .
" in my last relationship everything broke down and we fought every day . -lrb- … -rrb- it was a slow and painful breakup . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would you confess for a pair of green shoes ?
nils , 24 , was willing to share a secret he 'd never told anyone before - in return for three second-hand books . " in seventh grade , it was really important how much experience you had with girls , " he told mueller .
" i told my friends i 'd slept with a girl , but i had n't .
i invented the story about a girl i 'd met at camp .
that 's really embarrassing for me . " anther woman talked about her life on the street as a drug addict , said mueller .
" and then there was a french lady who wouldn ’ t stop talking .
she talked to me about her ' inner garden ' for 20 minutes , without me asking any questions - that was really weird . ' mueller is prepared to listen - at least for 5 to 20 minutes , depending on the item she 's selling .
but she 's also ready to talk - not only does she collect secrets , she also accepts items to sell in exchange for personal stories of her own . for a pair of shoes mueller talks about where she sees herself in 30 years . " to me , performance art has always been a way to express myself , " she said .
" performance art does not have to be subtle and abstract ; it can mean talking to normal people and involving them . " rethinking data protection the flea market-based radio play is n't mueller ’ s first artistic project .
in april 2007 she created a performance called " do n't cry .
work ! " for one week , she did any job she was asked to do - except soliciting .
she was surprised about how much people told her about their lives and personal details while she was working for them . " i had the feeling that people bought my time , " she said . according to mueller 's experience , the information age has made people more willing to share personal information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexandra mueller says people are willing to talk " i want people to think about how they give their data to other people , " said mueller .
" when they have to tell me stories about their sex life or stuff like that , they get a feeling for this situation of giving data away . " maybe in their real life they will think about it too . " one show , two stages mueller 's two-way secret-telling performances began in august in an art gallery in the prenzlauer berg neighborhood of berlin .
in early september , she moved into an old post office in the neukoelln district , where she intends to stay through sept .
27 . the old post office is particularly suited to mueller 's concept : in the past , people wrote their secrets down on paper and brought them to the post office to buy a stamp and send them to far-away friend .
today , they meet müller in the post office and tell their secrets without sealing them . i wanted to perform in two very different parts of berlin , she explained : " prenzlauer berg is more the manhattan of berlin ; it 's very flashy and there are a lot of young people .
neukoelln is more the bronx of berlin ; there are a lot of foreigners here . " and the more varied the intimate stories are , the more interesting mueller 's radio play will become .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 08.09.2009 brazil to boost its military standing with strategic french partnership deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil hopes to profit from its strategic partnership with france french president nicolas sarkozy has signed a deal deepening military ties with brazil .
the strategic partnership between both countries was first launched last year and gives brazil more clout in latin america . the partnership covers the production of 50 helicopters , four conventional submarines and the development of the first brazilian nuclear submarine , even though the contract explicitly excludes the transfer of french nuclear know-how .
there are also investments planned in industrial and harbour facilities .
the project will cost the brazilian government around 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.4 billion -rrb- and will be financed by a consortium made up of six european banks .
the military cooperation includes the purchase of 36 french fighter planes , a deal that will give brazil one of the most advanced combat aircraft in latin america .
a valuable investment ?
however , german defence experts are sceptical about the military cooperation .
they believe the billion-euro treaty , which will boost brazil 's military capacity , could trigger an arms race on the continent , without bringing the advantages , which the brazilian government expects .
" right now it is hard to say whether this project will be successful indeed from a technological perspective and whether it will give brazil military advantages compared to other countries .
an ambitious project like this can also turn out to be a failure , " says ottfried nassauer , who is the head of the berlin information center for transatlantic security .
according to nassauer the cooperation with france should not cause any concern for the neighboring countries , as the understanding among the governments on the continent is good .
but he thinks that the money could be invested better elsewhere .
" the question which luiz inacio lula da silva 's government should ask is whether the investments are not too high and whether it is worth it , to spend such large amounts of money for its own political and military status .
there are many other social and economical fields , where the same kind of money most likely would create many more jobs and possibly lead to more transfer of technology .
military technology always costs more than civil technology , " says nassauer .
regional predominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bilateral deal could anger some of brazil 's regional neighbors political scientist daniel flemes , who is an expert for defence politics with the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg , fears that the cooperation with france can cause problems for the cooperation with latin american neighbors and lead to a regional arms race .
" the fact that brazil gains technological know-how out of partnerships outside of latin america , could trigger an arms race on the continent and hinder defence cooperation with the neighbouring countries , " flemes says .
he believes that brazil not only wants to secure its regional predominance with the contract , but is also striving to become a super power . " the country is trying to stabilise its regional predominance , not only on an economical and political , but on a military level as well .
simultaneously it wishes to expand its influence as an emerging country internationally , " flemes says .
but he also thinks brazil 's ambitions are a natural development , as some of its neighbors are expanding their military strength as well .
" some neighboring countries are modernising their military infrastructure .
venezuela spent four billion euros in the last four or five years on arms imports from russia .
also chile has increased its defence budget over the past years .
so brazil does n't stand alone with its military investments .
over the past five years time the total amount of defence expenditure in south america has more than doubled , " say flemes .

the strategic partnership between both countries was first launched last year and gives brazil more clout in latin america . the partnership covers the production of 50 helicopters , four conventional submarines and the development of the first brazilian nuclear submarine , even though the contract explicitly excludes the transfer of french nuclear know-how .
there are also investments planned in industrial and harbour facilities .
the project will cost the brazilian government around 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.4 billion -rrb- and will be financed by a consortium made up of six european banks .
the military cooperation includes the purchase of 36 french fighter planes , a deal that will give brazil one of the most advanced combat aircraft in latin america .
a valuable investment ?
however , german defence experts are sceptical about the military cooperation .
they believe the billion-euro treaty , which will boost brazil 's military capacity , could trigger an arms race on the continent , without bringing the advantages , which the brazilian government expects .
" right now it is hard to say whether this project will be successful indeed from a technological perspective and whether it will give brazil military advantages compared to other countries .
an ambitious project like this can also turn out to be a failure , " says ottfried nassauer , who is the head of the berlin information center for transatlantic security .
according to nassauer the cooperation with france should not cause any concern for the neighboring countries , as the understanding among the governments on the continent is good .
but he thinks that the money could be invested better elsewhere .
" the question which luiz inacio lula da silva 's government should ask is whether the investments are not too high and whether it is worth it , to spend such large amounts of money for its own political and military status .
there are many other social and economical fields , where the same kind of money most likely would create many more jobs and possibly lead to more transfer of technology .
military technology always costs more than civil technology , " says nassauer .
regional predominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bilateral deal could anger some of brazil 's regional neighbors political scientist daniel flemes , who is an expert for defence politics with the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg , fears that the cooperation with france can cause problems for the cooperation with latin american neighbors and lead to a regional arms race .
" the fact that brazil gains technological know-how out of partnerships outside of latin america , could trigger an arms race on the continent and hinder defence cooperation with the neighbouring countries , " flemes says .
he believes that brazil not only wants to secure its regional predominance with the contract , but is also striving to become a super power . " the country is trying to stabilise its regional predominance , not only on an economical and political , but on a military level as well .
simultaneously it wishes to expand its influence as an emerging country internationally , " flemes says .
but he also thinks brazil 's ambitions are a natural development , as some of its neighbors are expanding their military strength as well .
" some neighboring countries are modernising their military infrastructure .
venezuela spent four billion euros in the last four or five years on arms imports from russia .
also chile has increased its defence budget over the past years .
so brazil does n't stand alone with its military investments .
over the past five years time the total amount of defence expenditure in south america has more than doubled , " say flemes .

they hope that the central authorities will deal with their complaints caused or overlooked by the authorities in their home towns .
now , with the 60th anniversary of the founding of the people ’ s republic just weeks away , the communist party has ordered local officials to meet more regularly with people complaining of injustices . every weekday a curious scene unfolds outside a non-descript government building in one of beijing ’ s southern districts .
from early morning onwards hundreds of petitioners from all over china start queuing at the office for “ letters and visits ” .
many carry dog-eared documents and tattered photos .
security is tight with police patrolling the street and the entrance to the office .
that does not deter people like 40-year old shan from the north-eastern province of heilongjiang .
she lost her job at a coal mine after trying to expose corruption .
“ originally i had filed a complaint locally about my bosses who illegally took over some company flats and embezzled social security funds .
when i didn ’ t get any answers , i appealed to the provincial authorities , but they didn ’ t do anything either . i didn ’ t know what to do and decided to come to beijing . ”
less trust on local officials millions of petitions are received by the so-called xinfang-offices every year , but only a very small percentage gets resolved .
that does not prevent more and more people from placing their faith in a system that has its roots in china ’ s imperial past .
they cling to the belief that they will get justice from a benign central government .
“ i think those high up there , they are ok .
the central government is fair and just .
so when the lower ranking officials make mistakes , i have to come here to beijing to get them to enforce the rules . ”
experts say the petitioning system exposes the flaws of china ’ s legal system which is still under the control of the communist party .
fundamental political reform the rule of law is still a work in progress and few citizens trust the often corrupt local courts .
human rights lawyer li fangping says the only solution is fundamental political reform .
“ firstly we need an independent judiciary .
secondly we need democratic oversight at the local level .
local -lrb- and regional -rrb- governments have to be chosen in democratic elections not by those higher up . ”
at the petitioning office in beijing the line of waiting people stretches back some 200 metres .
the pavement opposite is lined with cars and minivans from other provinces .
local officials often send hired thugs to beijing to stop petitioners from raising the alarm .
mrs shan was once caught by thugs and thrown into a so-called “ black jail ” , an unofficial detention facility on the outskirts of beijing .
“ when we arrived there they tried to take my bag from me .
i resisted and a scuffle broke out .
then a young man approached me from behind , beat me severely with an electric baton and injured me . ”
growing awareness human rights groups say growing numbers of petitioners end up in these unofficial jails .
last month the case of a young woman who said she was raped by a guard caused a stir .
but the central government denies these black jails exist .
and yet , there ’ s growing awareness among the chinese about their rights .
mrs shan , for instance , who suffered severe injuries from the beatings in the black jail , has launched a second case – this time against the police who failed to help and protect her .
she ’ s still waiting for an answer . author : ruth kirchner -lrb- beijing -rrb- editor : grahame lucas 08/09/09 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 07 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.09.2009 ruettgers ' romania slur meant to placate the far right , author says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers relies on inflammatory rhetoric , according to georgescu romanian-born writer vlad georgescu has filed charges of sedition and defamation against the premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia .
he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 08.09.2009 lawmakers clear names of german ' war-time traitors ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig baumann has fought for the honor of ' traitors ' germany 's parliament has voted to collectively and posthumously declare innocent german soldiers sentenced to death for war treason by military courts during world war ii . germany 's parliament , the bundestag , voted unanimously on tuesday to rehabilitate soldiers sentenced to death for deserting during world war ii .
the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumann 's death sentence became a prison sentence germany 's major political parties had first declined to support the current legislation because it was brought before parliament by the left party .
many of the party 's leading figures were once members of the communist party of former east germany .
the parties finally agreed to sponsor the bill when the left party removed itself from the list of backers .
arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .
but a justice ministry review headed by hans hugo klein , a former judge at the constitutional court , established that the nazis ' treason law was a merciless instrument of repression , and was so vague that it gave room to arbitrary rulings .
rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .
since then he has fought an uphill battle against prejudice and bureaucracy to see the records wiped clean .
he is the sole survivor of the group who initiated the association 20 years ago .
" i did n't want to be part of it any longer " baumann was an infantryman in occupied france when he deserted his regiment in 1942 .
he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .
his sentence was converted to 12 years imprisonment , and he was sent to the army prison in torgau , germany .
he survived , but when he returned to germany after the war , he found that the stigma of treason clung to him .
" i received many death threats .
we were treated like as cowards , scumbags and traitors .
no one was on our side . "
one group left to fight for it took years before opinion started to turn .
finally , in 1998 and 2002 , laws were passed that rehabilitated conscientious objectors , those found guilty of undermining the war effort , spies and deserters – among them baumann himself .
that left the small group of those charged with military treason - and baumann continued his battle on their behalf , despite the fact that his own honor had been restored .
according to baumann , 68 death sentences were handed down for wartime treason , and they were all executed but for one .
general walther von seydlitz-kurzbach survived because he was by that time a russian prisoner of war .
baumann is pleased that parliament is about to close one of the last chapter 's of nazi military arbitrariness .
but that does not mean he has forgotten the past : “ it was such a horror , it hounds me to this very day . ” db / afp / dpa / epd editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the integration of the two telecoms would create an entity with an estimated net value in excess of 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.74 billion -rrb- .
the firm would command a dominating 37 percent market share with around 28.4 million clients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orange aimes to build up its uk position in the venture any merger would first need approval by both groups ' supervisory boards and competition authorities .
a deal is expected to be signed by october .
deutsche telekom has been looking at improving the situation of its troubled british mobile unit for some time , but did not want to incur the costs of restructuring alone .
for france telecom , the deal is seen as a way its subsidiary can increase its market share without paying cash or taking on more debt .
deutsche telekom said tuesday in a statement the tie-up would give british clients " expanded network coverage and enhanced indoor and outdoor network quality for 2g and 3g services . "

one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .
i do n't see that as a big problem .

but decisions over details of the new monument in berlin have caused some controversy . the monument , which bears the inscription " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom , " is located near the headquarters of the defense ministry in berlin .
some critics have said it should be located closer to germany 's parliament building - in a different part of the city - as the german army is officially the parliament 's army .
" the soldiers would have picked out another place for their monument .
they would have wanted it to be in a more prominent place , such as near the reichstag building , " said reinhold robbe , the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces .
" in the end , only the parliament decides when and where soldiers are going to be sent to serve . "
the german army , or bundeswehr , was founded in 1955 , and to date , around 3,100 service members have died while in active duty .
manner of death an issue although the monument 's opening comes at a time when a growing number of german soldiers are being killed in afghanistan , the monument does not differentiate between soldiers and civilian employees of the army who lost their lives due to accidents or suicide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meck and a model of his memorial reinhard fuerher is the president of the german war graves commission and thinks a distinction should be made .
" there 's a big difference between someone in the bundeswehr who is killed because of a careless accident and someone who was sent by the german parliament into a war-like situation , " fuerher said .
" accidents , suicide - it 's all a part of this , " counters robbe .
" for the loved ones of a dead soldier it 's still a bad thing when someone loses their life . "
a modern memorial the plans for a monument for german soldiers killed in service has been around for some time .
the idea came to defense minister franz-josef jung during a visit to afghanistan in 2005 .
there , german soldiers had erected their own monument to their fallen comrades .
despite criticism from members of parliament , jung has always been adamant that the memorial be placed near the headquarters of the bundeswehr .
while the location and the exact meaning of the monument have led to debate , the monument itself has been widely accepted .
munich-based architect andreas meck is the architect of the memorial and presented his plan in 2007 .
construction officially began with a groundbreaking ceremony last november .
the final structure is about 40 meters -lrb- 131 feet -rrb- long and is supported by columns .
a computer screen cycles through the names of dead soldiers , briefly displaying each one before blending in the next .

development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "
his advice is that , " we should support independent african solutions only . "

we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .
but the author distinguishes between rich and poor .
" i do n't condemn the policeman , who collects a bribe on the side of the road .
i do n't condemn the poor , who are often desperate to survive .
i condemn the political elites , who do n't give a damn about the people . "
paul banoba from transparency international in berlin , which studies and fights corruption worldwide , disagrees .
" you can not just blame the top , " he says in an interview with deutsche welle .
" in comparing corrupt policemen with corrupt politicians volker seitz may want to make a distinction between petty corruption and large-scale corruption .
but we define corruption as an evil in itself , at whatever level it occurs .
there is corruption at every level , it is widespread . "

what counts is the political will to improve the standard of living .
education is important .
human rights must be respected .
those things , i believe , are not negotiable , but it does n't have to be parliamentarian democracy as we know it . "

talking to deutsche welle chairman piet van assche confirms that their approach is different : " in almost 30 years in benin we never took any initiative of our own .
we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.09.2009 ruettgers ' romania slur meant to placate the far right , author says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers relies on inflammatory rhetoric , according to georgescu romanian-born writer vlad georgescu has filed charges of sedition and defamation against the premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia .
he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "

development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "
his advice is that , " we should support independent african solutions only . "
exception to the rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benin 's president , thomas yayi boni , has tried to crack down on corruption that is exactly what hubi and vinciane , a small belgian aid organisation , does in the republic of benin .
talking to deutsche welle chairman piet van assche confirms that their approach is different : " in almost 30 years in benin we never took any initiative of our own .
we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .
but the author distinguishes between rich and poor .
" i do n't condemn the policeman , who collects a bribe on the side of the road .
i do n't condemn the poor , who are often desperate to survive .
i condemn the political elites , who do n't give a damn about the people . "
paul banoba from transparency international in berlin , which studies and fights corruption worldwide , disagrees .

with 91.6 percent of votes counted , president hamid karzai has an absolute majority of 54.1 percent . this is the first time that the figures show that president hamid karzai has enough votes to win in a single round and avoid a runoff poll .
figures released by afghanistan 's independent electoral commission -lrb- iec -rrb- give karzai a commanding lead with 54.1 percent , with 91.6 percent of all votes counted so far .
karzai 's nearest rival , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , is well behind with 28.3 percent .
nearly 5.5 million valid votes have been counted so far , the iec said .
karzai has 2,959,093 votes against abdullah 's 1,546,490 , the electoral commission announced at a news conference on tuesday .
the electoral commission announced on sunday that it had discarded around 200,000 ballots from 447 polling sites nationally where it had found vote fraud .
partial recount ordered on tuesday , the un-backed independent election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- said it too had clear evidence of fraud in the election . the body said it received more than 2,000 complaints , about a third of which could impact the final result .
" in the course of its investigations , the election complaints commission has found clear and convincing evidence of fraud in a number of polling stations , " the ecc said in a statement .
it did not say which candidate gained from the fraud , or where the suspicious ballots had been cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans voted amid taliban threats of violence the ecc has ordered the electoral commission to review votes from 600 more polling stations .
these include stations where a single candidate received more than 95 percent of the votes and those where more than 600 votes were cast , the most that could be cast a single station .
polling stations with suspiciously high voter participation , given a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , are also to be reviewed .
the low turnout , accredited to taliban voter intimidation and violence , is also threatening to cast doubt on the credibility of the process and the legitimacy of the winner .
preliminary results from 100 percent of votes cast across the country are expected to be announced on thursday .
karzai must have 50 percent of all ballots cast , plus one extra ballot , to be declared the winner .
final official results are not due before sept .

with 91.6 percent of votes counted , president hamid karzai has an absolute majority of 54.1 percent . this is the first time that the figures show that president hamid karzai has enough votes to win in a single round and avoid a runoff poll .
figures released by afghanistan 's independent electoral commission -lrb- iec -rrb- give karzai a commanding lead with 54.1 percent , with 91.6 percent of all votes counted so far .
karzai 's nearest rival , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , is well behind with 28.3 percent .
nearly 5.5 million valid votes have been counted so far , the iec said .
karzai has 2,959,093 votes against abdullah 's 1,546,490 , the electoral commission announced at a news conference on tuesday .
the electoral commission announced on sunday that it had discarded around 200,000 ballots from 447 polling sites nationally where it had found vote fraud .
partial recount ordered on tuesday , the un-backed independent election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- said it too had clear evidence of fraud in the election . the body said it received more than 2,000 complaints , about a third of which could impact the final result .
" in the course of its investigations , the election complaints commission has found clear and convincing evidence of fraud in a number of polling stations , " the ecc said in a statement .
it did not say which candidate gained from the fraud , or where the suspicious ballots had been cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans voted amid taliban threats of violence the ecc has ordered the electoral commission to review votes from 600 more polling stations .
these include stations where a single candidate received more than 95 percent of the votes and those where more than 600 votes were cast , the most that could be cast a single station .
polling stations with suspiciously high voter participation , given a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , are also to be reviewed .
the low turnout , accredited to taliban voter intimidation and violence , is also threatening to cast doubt on the credibility of the process and the legitimacy of the winner .
preliminary results from 100 percent of votes cast across the country are expected to be announced on thursday .
karzai must have 50 percent of all ballots cast , plus one extra ballot , to be declared the winner .
final official results are not due before sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 08.09.2009 europe slams us plans for new tourist levy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility european travelers entering the us may be faced with a new levy in the future .
the plans by us lawmakers could trigger a trans-atlantic tit-for-tat response with travelers on both sides footing the bill . the european union has raised objections over us plans to introduce a $ 10 charge for travelers entering the us .
if the planned levy is deemed equivalent to a visa , eu lawmakers might decide to retaliate , by forcing entry-visas on us visitors to the 27-member bloc .
currently , 29 european countries are part of the us visa waiver program -lrb- among 35 countries worldwide -rrb- , permitting european tourists to enter the united states without a visa .
however , the us introduced an online registration process earlier this year , requiring european visitors to confirm their visa-free status , three days before their departure - a move that irritated eu officials in brussels at the time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 08.09.2009 europe slams us plans for new tourist levy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility european travelers entering the us may be faced with a new levy in the future .
the plans by us lawmakers could trigger a trans-atlantic tit-for-tat response with travelers on both sides footing the bill . the european union has raised objections over us plans to introduce a $ 10 charge for travelers entering the us .
if the planned levy is deemed equivalent to a visa , eu lawmakers might decide to retaliate , by forcing entry-visas on us visitors to the 27-member bloc .
currently , 29 european countries are part of the us visa waiver program -lrb- among 35 countries worldwide -rrb- , permitting european tourists to enter the united states without a visa .
however , the us introduced an online registration process earlier this year , requiring european visitors to confirm their visa-free status , three days before their departure - a move that irritated eu officials in brussels at the time .
the european commission signaled that if the us changed the requirements of its electronic system for travel authorization -lrb- esta -rrb- , the eu might be forced to review its own position .
" the introduction of a fee by the us , would require a new assessment of the european commission ... to evaluate whether the esta system , is tantamount to a visa or not , " said commission spokesman michele cercone .
scanning for terrorists eu officials believe a fee would also discourage european visitors from registering online , which - as cercone argued - would undermine the security objectives of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe may retaliate if the us introduces its $ 10 levy " the introduction of such a fee would constitute a step backward in our joint endeavor to ease transatlantic mobility , " cercone said .
that argument resonates with european civil liberties groups , which see the electronic registration process - with or without a fee - as an invasion of privacy rights .
they say the us has no right to the personal information of eu citizens .
the us argues that information is crucial in the fight against terrorism .
washington says the system gives us intelligence officials a 72 hours ' heads-up ' if unwanted visitors -lrb- or would-be terrorists -rrb- are planning to travel to the us .
officials in brussels are reluctant to comment further , stressing the plan to introduce a $ 10 charge is still being debated in washington .
but other eu representatives have been less cautious .
" only in ' alice in wonderland ' could a penalty be seen as promoting the activity on which it is imposed , " the european commission 's ambassador to the united states , john bruton , said . other eu objections , especially in countries where credit cards are less widely used , include the question of how any levy would be paid .
there is a growing sense in brussels , that forcing europeans to pay $ 10 to enter the united states by credit card and online only discriminates against those visitors who neither use the internet nor possess a credit card .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility the $ 10 registration fee , which would last two years before having to be renewed , has been described by us lawmakers as ' nominal . '
they say the money generated by the registration fee , would go towards teaching visitors how to use the electronic registration process as well as other programs to promote travel to the us .
the weakest link another source of tension between the eu and us over the visa waiver program , involves the way the deal is negotiated .
eu officials argue washington should stop negotiating with individual eu countries bilaterally , and instead , work with the european union has a whole .
but washington insiders accuse the eu of hypocrisy , arguing that if eu unity is so important to the europeans , then individual countries benefiting from the visa waiver program should be prepared to give it up in solidarity with those eu member states that continue to be excluded .
us administration officials also insist there are live security threats in europe .
washington clearly views greece as problematic .
it is the only ' old ' eu member state which has been denied the visa waiver program .
us intelligence does not trust greek passport security and is unconvinced by athens ' commitment to fighting terrorism and extremists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 08.09.2009 corrupt political elites block development in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's corrupt political elites are leaving their people to suffer african leaders are responsible for the problems in their countries , and not former colonial powers .
development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "
his advice is that , " we should support independent african solutions only . "
exception to the rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benin 's president , thomas yayi boni , has tried to crack down on corruption that is exactly what hubi and vinciane , a small belgian aid organisation , does in the republic of benin .
talking to deutsche welle chairman piet van assche confirms that their approach is different : " in almost 30 years in benin we never took any initiative of our own .
we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .
but the author distinguishes between rich and poor .
" i do n't condemn the policeman , who collects a bribe on the side of the road .
i do n't condemn the poor , who are often desperate to survive .
i condemn the political elites , who do n't give a damn about the people . "
paul banoba from transparency international in berlin , which studies and fights corruption worldwide , disagrees .
" you can not just blame the top , " he says in an interview with deutsche welle .
" in comparing corrupt policemen with corrupt politicians volker seitz may want to make a distinction between petty corruption and large-scale corruption .
but we define corruption as an evil in itself , at whatever level it occurs .
there is corruption at every level , it is widespread . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money makes the world go round especially for africa 's political elites it 's not easy to talk about corruption .
doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , which is represented in nearly all african countries , turned down deutsche welle 's interview request , arguing that , " msf is not involved in corruption , never deals with officials who expect a personal benefit and therefore hardly can answer the questions .
msf is neutral and does not officially blame others without being involved itself . "
piet van assche from hubi and vinciane says his company has managed to stay clear of any allegations of corruption : " to my knowledge we 've never had anything to do with corruption . "
democracy and its many faces van assche says that the transition of power in benin has gone smoothly since he started working there in the mid-eighties .
but volker seitz warns that european democracy does n't always fit into an african environment : " it 's difficult to transfer our western parliamentarian system to africa .
what counts is the political will to improve the standard of living .
education is important .
human rights must be respected .
those things , i believe , are not negotiable , but it does n't have to be parliamentarian democracy as we know it . "

the young artist who organized the market is collecting her customers ' private tales for a radio play . for a modest polka-dotted dress in green and white you 'll have to spend 10 minutes talking about morals and chastity .
a necklace is worth five minutes about a dirty little secret .
and for three books , you 'll have to tell something you 've never told anyone before . " of course , i am curious , " said 26-year-old alexandra mueller , the instigator and organizer of the berlin 's so-called " intimate flea market . " each conversation is recorded and will later be woven together dramaturgically into a radio play .
the moments she enjoys the most are when her conversation partners forget she is there and just keep talking to themselves . give and take " i do n't think i 'll ever manage to have functioning relationships , " said a girl who wanted to be called sonja .
the price tag on the green cap she was " paying for " called for six minutes about a breakup .
" in my last relationship everything broke down and we fought every day . -lrb- … -rrb- it was a slow and painful breakup . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would you confess for a pair of green shoes ?
nils , 24 , was willing to share a secret he 'd never told anyone before - in return for three second-hand books . " in seventh grade , it was really important how much experience you had with girls , " he told mueller .
" i told my friends i 'd slept with a girl , but i had n't .
i invented the story about a girl i 'd met at camp .
that 's really embarrassing for me . " anther woman talked about her life on the street as a drug addict , said mueller .
" and then there was a french lady who wouldn ’ t stop talking .
she talked to me about her ' inner garden ' for 20 minutes , without me asking any questions - that was really weird . ' mueller is prepared to listen - at least for 5 to 20 minutes , depending on the item she 's selling .
but she 's also ready to talk - not only does she collect secrets , she also accepts items to sell in exchange for personal stories of her own . for a pair of shoes mueller talks about where she sees herself in 30 years . " to me , performance art has always been a way to express myself , " she said .
" performance art does not have to be subtle and abstract ; it can mean talking to normal people and involving them . " rethinking data protection the flea market-based radio play is n't mueller ’ s first artistic project .
in april 2007 she created a performance called " do n't cry .
work ! " for one week , she did any job she was asked to do - except soliciting .
she was surprised about how much people told her about their lives and personal details while she was working for them . " i had the feeling that people bought my time , " she said . according to mueller 's experience , the information age has made people more willing to share personal information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexandra mueller says people are willing to talk " i want people to think about how they give their data to other people , " said mueller .
" when they have to tell me stories about their sex life or stuff like that , they get a feeling for this situation of giving data away . " maybe in their real life they will think about it too . " one show , two stages mueller 's two-way secret-telling performances began in august in an art gallery in the prenzlauer berg neighborhood of berlin .
in early september , she moved into an old post office in the neukoelln district , where she intends to stay through sept .
27 . the old post office is particularly suited to mueller 's concept : in the past , people wrote their secrets down on paper and brought them to the post office to buy a stamp and send them to far-away friend .
today , they meet müller in the post office and tell their secrets without sealing them . i wanted to perform in two very different parts of berlin , she explained : " prenzlauer berg is more the manhattan of berlin ; it 's very flashy and there are a lot of young people .
neukoelln is more the bronx of berlin ; there are a lot of foreigners here . " and the more varied the intimate stories are , the more interesting mueller 's radio play will become .
once it 's completed , it will be broadcast by german radio station swr . author : sabrina wendling editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the accord is designed to streamline operations for the further integration of the european union . the vote was necessary after the country 's highest court in june ruled that an existing german law intended to allow lawmakers to ratify the treaty had to be amended to give parliament more decision-making powers in brussels .
the lisbon treaty must be ratified by all 27 member states of the european union before it can take effect .
aside from germany , the ratification process must still be completed in ireland , the czech republic and poland .
the legislation , passed on tuesday , now goes to the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , where representatives of germany 's 16 states are scheduled to vote on it on sept .

german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung on tuesday that he hoped gm would lay out a clear course of action before the iaa international motor show opens in frankfurt on sept .
17 .
but the handelsblatt financial daily quoted sources close to the opel talks as saying gm is likely to postpone its decision again and wait until after the german federal election on sept .
27 before making any announcement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg wants gm to announce its plans by sept .
17 negotiations on opel have already gone on for months , with issues of state funding and potential job losses turning the sale into a political hot potato ahead of the election .
berlin 's favored bidder is canadian auto parts maker magna .
chancellor angela merkel and the german states think the company 's experience in the car industry puts it in a better position to save more of the 25,000 opel jobs based in germany .
but gm has signaled it would prefer to sell its european unit to belgian-based investment group rhj international , or perhaps even keep the business for itself .
retaining control the head of a pro-business group in chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union , kurt lauk , said gm is unlikely to sell opel to magna because detroit did n't want to pass valuable intellectual property on to magna 's russian partner sberbank .

" while the days of marking official documents with an " x " are long past for the vast majority of germans , not being able to read or write remains a problem that is growing more acute as jobs requiring few skills dry up , according to peter hubertus , the head of germany 's federal literacy association . " there are still people with limited reading and writing skills , and for a long time that has not been a large problem - even for the people who could not read or write at all , " he told deutsche welle .
" but the shift toward a knowledge-based society makes greater educational demands .
it 's clear that a person in germany in 2009 ca n't get by reading and writing at a first or second-grade level . " most functional illiterates attended school bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some students can write only at the most basic of levels hubertus estimated that there are 4 million illiterate people in germany with the reading and writing skills of a primary school student .
the majority of these people attended german schools , which he said posed a major problem for germany as students leave school frustrated and without sufficient basic skills . while numerous courses exist to teach young people how to read and write , it 's difficult to convince many of them how important these skills are . " there are a lot of courses , but we 're unable to reach many young adults , " hubertus said .
" young people tend to be so happy to be finished with school and no longer have to deal with writing .
when they leave school it 's hard to get them involved in a new learning process . " motivating kids to learn but in order for germany to maintain its position as an economic power , schools have to try to keep students from leaving without being able to read or write , according to michael huether , the director of a german economic research institute in cologne . the key to reaching young people is to disguise the learning process with issues they are already involved in , hubertus said , adding that fashion and music have proven to be areas where many illiterate or functionally illiterate teenagers want to make their opinions known . ideally , schools would identify learning deficiencies before kids reach their teens , hubertus said . " we have to strengthen kindergartens , provide better training for teachers and improve primary schools , " he said .
" there needs to be more individualized learning so students are supported step by step .
all this has to happen with topics that are interesting for each of the various age groups . " klaus gehrke -lrb- sms / dpa / ap -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumann 's death sentence became a prison sentence germany 's major political parties had first declined to support the current legislation because it was brought before parliament by the left party .
many of the party 's leading figures were once members of the communist party of former east germany .
the parties finally agreed to sponsor the bill when the left party removed itself from the list of backers .
arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .
but a justice ministry review headed by hans hugo klein , a former judge at the constitutional court , established that the nazis ' treason law was a merciless instrument of repression , and was so vague that it gave room to arbitrary rulings .
rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .
since then he has fought an uphill battle against prejudice and bureaucracy to see the records wiped clean .
he is the sole survivor of the group who initiated the association 20 years ago .
" i did n't want to be part of it any longer " baumann was an infantryman in occupied france when he deserted his regiment in 1942 .
he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .
his sentence was converted to 12 years imprisonment , and he was sent to the army prison in torgau , germany .
he survived , but when he returned to germany after the war , he found that the stigma of treason clung to him .
" i received many death threats .
we were treated like as cowards , scumbags and traitors .
no one was on our side . "
one group left to fight for it took years before opinion started to turn .
finally , in 1998 and 2002 , laws were passed that rehabilitated conscientious objectors , those found guilty of undermining the war effort , spies and deserters – among them baumann himself .
that left the small group of those charged with military treason - and baumann continued his battle on their behalf , despite the fact that his own honor had been restored .
according to baumann , 68 death sentences were handed down for wartime treason , and they were all executed but for one .
general walther von seydlitz-kurzbach survived because he was by that time a russian prisoner of war .
baumann is pleased that parliament is about to close one of the last chapter 's of nazi military arbitrariness .

the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "

the accord is designed to streamline operations for the further integration of the european union . the vote was necessary after the country 's highest court in june ruled that an existing german law intended to allow lawmakers to ratify the treaty had to be amended to give parliament more decision-making powers in brussels .
the lisbon treaty must be ratified by all 27 member states of the european union before it can take effect .
aside from germany , the ratification process must still be completed in ireland , the czech republic and poland .
the legislation , passed on tuesday , now goes to the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , where representatives of germany 's 16 states are scheduled to vote on it on sept .
18 .
if it passes there , as expected , the law then goes to president horst koehler , whose signature would make germany 's ratification of the lisbon treaty official. gb / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 08.09.2009 german analyst plays down trans-atlantic rift over airstrike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of germans in afghanistan is a bone of contention a nato airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan 's kunduz province may have sparked a rift between berlin and washington .
one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .
i do n't see that as a big problem .

one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .
i do n't see that as a big problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.09.2009 ruettgers ' romania slur meant to placate the far right , author says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers relies on inflammatory rhetoric , according to georgescu romanian-born writer vlad georgescu has filed charges of sedition and defamation against the premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia .
he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .

he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 08.09.2009 corrupt political elites block development in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's corrupt political elites are leaving their people to suffer african leaders are responsible for the problems in their countries , and not former colonial powers .
development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "
his advice is that , " we should support independent african solutions only . "
exception to the rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benin 's president , thomas yayi boni , has tried to crack down on corruption that is exactly what hubi and vinciane , a small belgian aid organisation , does in the republic of benin .
talking to deutsche welle chairman piet van assche confirms that their approach is different : " in almost 30 years in benin we never took any initiative of our own .
we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .
but the author distinguishes between rich and poor .
" i do n't condemn the policeman , who collects a bribe on the side of the road .
i do n't condemn the poor , who are often desperate to survive .
i condemn the political elites , who do n't give a damn about the people . "
paul banoba from transparency international in berlin , which studies and fights corruption worldwide , disagrees .
" you can not just blame the top , " he says in an interview with deutsche welle .
" in comparing corrupt policemen with corrupt politicians volker seitz may want to make a distinction between petty corruption and large-scale corruption .
but we define corruption as an evil in itself , at whatever level it occurs .
there is corruption at every level , it is widespread . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money makes the world go round especially for africa 's political elites it 's not easy to talk about corruption .
doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , which is represented in nearly all african countries , turned down deutsche welle 's interview request , arguing that , " msf is not involved in corruption , never deals with officials who expect a personal benefit and therefore hardly can answer the questions .
msf is neutral and does not officially blame others without being involved itself . "
piet van assche from hubi and vinciane says his company has managed to stay clear of any allegations of corruption : " to my knowledge we 've never had anything to do with corruption . "
democracy and its many faces van assche says that the transition of power in benin has gone smoothly since he started working there in the mid-eighties .
but volker seitz warns that european democracy does n't always fit into an african environment : " it 's difficult to transfer our western parliamentarian system to africa .
what counts is the political will to improve the standard of living .
education is important .
human rights must be respected .
those things , i believe , are not negotiable , but it does n't have to be parliamentarian democracy as we know it . "

so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

" every innocent person who is killed in afghanistan is one too many , " merkel told parliamentarians in berlin .
while promising a thorough investigation and a full report on the raid , which is believed to have left dozens of taliban militants as well as civilians dead , merkel slammed critics for drawing premature conclusions .
" i will ensure that we will not put a gloss on anything .
i will also ensure that we will not accept any premature judgments .
and having experienced what i have in recent days , i say very clearly : i will not take this from anyone , either here in germany or from abroad , " she said .
on saturday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner had called the airstrike a " big mistake . "
afghan president hamid karzai had told french daily le figaro in an interview published on monday that the attack was an " error of judgment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike targeted two fuel trucks that were hijacked by taliban militants " militarily necessary and correct " the german defense ministry on monday described the airstrike as " militarily necessary and correct " because it prevented the taliban from using the two hijacked fuel trucks as mobile bombs .
germany defense minister franz josef jung of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- has faced criticism over his information policy as well as calls for him to step down .
his ministry had initially said that the airstrike had only killed taliban militants .
however , on monday jung was forced to acknowledge that he could no longer rule out any civilian casualties , and on tuesday the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan indicated for the first time that civilians were probably killed in the attack , however , without providing any exact casualty figures .
" believing civilians were not in the area , the local isaf commander authorized an airstrike , which destroyed the two fuel trucks , " isaf said in a statement .
" subsequent review has led isaf to believe that along with insurgents , civilians also were killed and injured in the strike . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defence minister jung says the airstrike was necessary not an election campaign with all but one german political party supporting the government 's stance on the afghanistan mission , parliamentarians were quick to affirm on tuesday that the tragic incident would not be exploited as a campaign issue ahead of the sept .
27 national election .
the only party in the bundestag calling for the immediate withdrawal of germany 's 4,200 troops is the left party .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " oskar lafontaine , the co-leader of the opposition left told parliament on tuesday .
however , the left party and its leaders have a reputation in germany for demanding what is currently popular rather than politically expedient .
even before the airstrike controversy , a poll in july showed that up to 69 percent of germans wanted their soldiers to pull out of afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine , co-leader of the left party , wants germany out of afghanistan government remains committed despite the german public 's reservations over the afghanistan mission , the chancellor has refrained from giving any pullout date for german forces , and she also sidestepped the issue during her speech on tuesday .
instead , merkel drew attention to what had brought international forces to the war-torn country in the first place .
" it was afghanistan , controlled by the taliban and al qaeda , that was the breeding ground for the terror of september 11 , " merkel said .
" the september 11 attacks were followed by dreadful attacks in europe - in madrid and in london .
we know too that germany is in their sights ...
the engagement in afghanistan is our reaction to terror .
that 's where it came from , not the other way around . "
merkel also referred to a joint german-british-franco proposal for an international conference this year to pressure the afghan government to take on more responsibilities , enabling the withdrawal of coalition forces .
" for germany , britain and france , this conference is about creating the conditions for developing an internationally agreed handover strategy , " merkel said on tuesday .
" our overriding political goal is and remains an afghanistan that can handle its own security . "
it was unclear where and when the conference would be held , but the united nations , which is to host the event , has proposed kabul as the venue. nk / reuters / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they hope that the central authorities will deal with their complaints caused or overlooked by the authorities in their home towns .
now , with the 60th anniversary of the founding of the people ’ s republic just weeks away , the communist party has ordered local officials to meet more regularly with people complaining of injustices . every weekday a curious scene unfolds outside a non-descript government building in one of beijing ’ s southern districts .
from early morning onwards hundreds of petitioners from all over china start queuing at the office for “ letters and visits ” .
many carry dog-eared documents and tattered photos .
security is tight with police patrolling the street and the entrance to the office .
that does not deter people like 40-year old shan from the north-eastern province of heilongjiang .
she lost her job at a coal mine after trying to expose corruption .
“ originally i had filed a complaint locally about my bosses who illegally took over some company flats and embezzled social security funds .
when i didn ’ t get any answers , i appealed to the provincial authorities , but they didn ’ t do anything either . i didn ’ t know what to do and decided to come to beijing . ”
less trust on local officials millions of petitions are received by the so-called xinfang-offices every year , but only a very small percentage gets resolved .
that does not prevent more and more people from placing their faith in a system that has its roots in china ’ s imperial past .
they cling to the belief that they will get justice from a benign central government .
“ i think those high up there , they are ok .
the central government is fair and just .
so when the lower ranking officials make mistakes , i have to come here to beijing to get them to enforce the rules . ”
experts say the petitioning system exposes the flaws of china ’ s legal system which is still under the control of the communist party .
fundamental political reform the rule of law is still a work in progress and few citizens trust the often corrupt local courts .
human rights lawyer li fangping says the only solution is fundamental political reform .
“ firstly we need an independent judiciary .
secondly we need democratic oversight at the local level .
local -lrb- and regional -rrb- governments have to be chosen in democratic elections not by those higher up . ”
at the petitioning office in beijing the line of waiting people stretches back some 200 metres .
the pavement opposite is lined with cars and minivans from other provinces .
local officials often send hired thugs to beijing to stop petitioners from raising the alarm .
mrs shan was once caught by thugs and thrown into a so-called “ black jail ” , an unofficial detention facility on the outskirts of beijing .
“ when we arrived there they tried to take my bag from me .
i resisted and a scuffle broke out .
then a young man approached me from behind , beat me severely with an electric baton and injured me . ”
growing awareness human rights groups say growing numbers of petitioners end up in these unofficial jails .
last month the case of a young woman who said she was raped by a guard caused a stir .
but the central government denies these black jails exist .
and yet , there ’ s growing awareness among the chinese about their rights .
mrs shan , for instance , who suffered severe injuries from the beatings in the black jail , has launched a second case – this time against the police who failed to help and protect her .
she ’ s still waiting for an answer . author : ruth kirchner -lrb- beijing -rrb- editor : grahame lucas 08/09/09 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 asian development bank the adb is planning to rope in the private sector to cater to primary development needs by 2020 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.09.2009 ruettgers ' romania slur meant to placate the far right , author says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers relies on inflammatory rhetoric , according to georgescu romanian-born writer vlad georgescu has filed charges of sedition and defamation against the premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia .
he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 08.09.2009 brazil to boost its military standing with strategic french partnership deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil hopes to profit from its strategic partnership with france french president nicolas sarkozy has signed a deal deepening military ties with brazil .
the strategic partnership between both countries was first launched last year and gives brazil more clout in latin america . the partnership covers the production of 50 helicopters , four conventional submarines and the development of the first brazilian nuclear submarine , even though the contract explicitly excludes the transfer of french nuclear know-how .
there are also investments planned in industrial and harbour facilities .
the project will cost the brazilian government around 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.4 billion -rrb- and will be financed by a consortium made up of six european banks .
the military cooperation includes the purchase of 36 french fighter planes , a deal that will give brazil one of the most advanced combat aircraft in latin america .
a valuable investment ?
however , german defence experts are sceptical about the military cooperation .
they believe the billion-euro treaty , which will boost brazil 's military capacity , could trigger an arms race on the continent , without bringing the advantages , which the brazilian government expects .
" right now it is hard to say whether this project will be successful indeed from a technological perspective and whether it will give brazil military advantages compared to other countries .
an ambitious project like this can also turn out to be a failure , " says ottfried nassauer , who is the head of the berlin information center for transatlantic security .
according to nassauer the cooperation with france should not cause any concern for the neighboring countries , as the understanding among the governments on the continent is good .
but he thinks that the money could be invested better elsewhere .
" the question which luiz inacio lula da silva 's government should ask is whether the investments are not too high and whether it is worth it , to spend such large amounts of money for its own political and military status .
there are many other social and economical fields , where the same kind of money most likely would create many more jobs and possibly lead to more transfer of technology .
military technology always costs more than civil technology , " says nassauer .
regional predominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bilateral deal could anger some of brazil 's regional neighbors political scientist daniel flemes , who is an expert for defence politics with the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg , fears that the cooperation with france can cause problems for the cooperation with latin american neighbors and lead to a regional arms race .
" the fact that brazil gains technological know-how out of partnerships outside of latin america , could trigger an arms race on the continent and hinder defence cooperation with the neighbouring countries , " flemes says .
he believes that brazil not only wants to secure its regional predominance with the contract , but is also striving to become a super power . " the country is trying to stabilise its regional predominance , not only on an economical and political , but on a military level as well .
simultaneously it wishes to expand its influence as an emerging country internationally , " flemes says .
but he also thinks brazil 's ambitions are a natural development , as some of its neighbors are expanding their military strength as well .
" some neighboring countries are modernising their military infrastructure .
venezuela spent four billion euros in the last four or five years on arms imports from russia .
also chile has increased its defence budget over the past years .
so brazil does n't stand alone with its military investments .
over the past five years time the total amount of defence expenditure in south america has more than doubled , " say flemes .

the country has to make sure students are literate , one expert told dw . as the world observes world literacy day , there are estimated to be 776 million people who are unable to read or write , according to the united nations .
that statistic led un secretary-general ban ki-moon to call for increased effort in the fight to end illiteracy . " in a world of enormous wealth and in a world where education and knowledge are the keys to a better life , the extent of global illiteracy is shocking , " he said .
" education gives people the tools they need to improve their living situation and take part in public decision making . " while the days of marking official documents with an " x " are long past for the vast majority of germans , not being able to read or write remains a problem that is growing more acute as jobs requiring few skills dry up , according to peter hubertus , the head of germany 's federal literacy association . " there are still people with limited reading and writing skills , and for a long time that has not been a large problem - even for the people who could not read or write at all , " he told deutsche welle .
" but the shift toward a knowledge-based society makes greater educational demands .
it 's clear that a person in germany in 2009 ca n't get by reading and writing at a first or second-grade level . " most functional illiterates attended school bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some students can write only at the most basic of levels hubertus estimated that there are 4 million illiterate people in germany with the reading and writing skills of a primary school student .
the majority of these people attended german schools , which he said posed a major problem for germany as students leave school frustrated and without sufficient basic skills . while numerous courses exist to teach young people how to read and write , it 's difficult to convince many of them how important these skills are . " there are a lot of courses , but we 're unable to reach many young adults , " hubertus said .
" young people tend to be so happy to be finished with school and no longer have to deal with writing .
when they leave school it 's hard to get them involved in a new learning process . " motivating kids to learn but in order for germany to maintain its position as an economic power , schools have to try to keep students from leaving without being able to read or write , according to michael huether , the director of a german economic research institute in cologne . the key to reaching young people is to disguise the learning process with issues they are already involved in , hubertus said , adding that fashion and music have proven to be areas where many illiterate or functionally illiterate teenagers want to make their opinions known . ideally , schools would identify learning deficiencies before kids reach their teens , hubertus said . " we have to strengthen kindergartens , provide better training for teachers and improve primary schools , " he said .
" there needs to be more individualized learning so students are supported step by step .
all this has to happen with topics that are interesting for each of the various age groups . " klaus gehrke -lrb- sms / dpa / ap -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" every innocent person who is killed in afghanistan is one too many , " merkel told parliamentarians in berlin .
while promising a thorough investigation and a full report on the raid , which is believed to have left dozens of taliban militants as well as civilians dead , merkel slammed critics for drawing premature conclusions .
" i will ensure that we will not put a gloss on anything .
i will also ensure that we will not accept any premature judgments .
and having experienced what i have in recent days , i say very clearly : i will not take this from anyone , either here in germany or from abroad , " she said .
on saturday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner had called the airstrike a " big mistake . "
afghan president hamid karzai had told french daily le figaro in an interview published on monday that the attack was an " error of judgment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike targeted two fuel trucks that were hijacked by taliban militants " militarily necessary and correct " the german defense ministry on monday described the airstrike as " militarily necessary and correct " because it prevented the taliban from using the two hijacked fuel trucks as mobile bombs .
germany defense minister franz josef jung of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- has faced criticism over his information policy as well as calls for him to step down .
his ministry had initially said that the airstrike had only killed taliban militants .
however , on monday jung was forced to acknowledge that he could no longer rule out any civilian casualties , and on tuesday the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan indicated for the first time that civilians were probably killed in the attack , however , without providing any exact casualty figures .
" believing civilians were not in the area , the local isaf commander authorized an airstrike , which destroyed the two fuel trucks , " isaf said in a statement .
" subsequent review has led isaf to believe that along with insurgents , civilians also were killed and injured in the strike . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defence minister jung says the airstrike was necessary not an election campaign with all but one german political party supporting the government 's stance on the afghanistan mission , parliamentarians were quick to affirm on tuesday that the tragic incident would not be exploited as a campaign issue ahead of the sept .
27 national election .
the only party in the bundestag calling for the immediate withdrawal of germany 's 4,200 troops is the left party .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " oskar lafontaine , the co-leader of the opposition left told parliament on tuesday .
however , the left party and its leaders have a reputation in germany for demanding what is currently popular rather than politically expedient .
even before the airstrike controversy , a poll in july showed that up to 69 percent of germans wanted their soldiers to pull out of afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine , co-leader of the left party , wants germany out of afghanistan government remains committed despite the german public 's reservations over the afghanistan mission , the chancellor has refrained from giving any pullout date for german forces , and she also sidestepped the issue during her speech on tuesday .
instead , merkel drew attention to what had brought international forces to the war-torn country in the first place .
" it was afghanistan , controlled by the taliban and al qaeda , that was the breeding ground for the terror of september 11 , " merkel said .
" the september 11 attacks were followed by dreadful attacks in europe - in madrid and in london .
we know too that germany is in their sights ...
the engagement in afghanistan is our reaction to terror .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 08.09.2009 europe slams us plans for new tourist levy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility european travelers entering the us may be faced with a new levy in the future .
the plans by us lawmakers could trigger a trans-atlantic tit-for-tat response with travelers on both sides footing the bill . the european union has raised objections over us plans to introduce a $ 10 charge for travelers entering the us .
if the planned levy is deemed equivalent to a visa , eu lawmakers might decide to retaliate , by forcing entry-visas on us visitors to the 27-member bloc .
currently , 29 european countries are part of the us visa waiver program -lrb- among 35 countries worldwide -rrb- , permitting european tourists to enter the united states without a visa .
however , the us introduced an online registration process earlier this year , requiring european visitors to confirm their visa-free status , three days before their departure - a move that irritated eu officials in brussels at the time .
the european commission signaled that if the us changed the requirements of its electronic system for travel authorization -lrb- esta -rrb- , the eu might be forced to review its own position .
" the introduction of a fee by the us , would require a new assessment of the european commission ... to evaluate whether the esta system , is tantamount to a visa or not , " said commission spokesman michele cercone .
scanning for terrorists eu officials believe a fee would also discourage european visitors from registering online , which - as cercone argued - would undermine the security objectives of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe may retaliate if the us introduces its $ 10 levy " the introduction of such a fee would constitute a step backward in our joint endeavor to ease transatlantic mobility , " cercone said .
that argument resonates with european civil liberties groups , which see the electronic registration process - with or without a fee - as an invasion of privacy rights .
they say the us has no right to the personal information of eu citizens .
the us argues that information is crucial in the fight against terrorism .
washington says the system gives us intelligence officials a 72 hours ' heads-up ' if unwanted visitors -lrb- or would-be terrorists -rrb- are planning to travel to the us .
officials in brussels are reluctant to comment further , stressing the plan to introduce a $ 10 charge is still being debated in washington .
but other eu representatives have been less cautious .
" only in ' alice in wonderland ' could a penalty be seen as promoting the activity on which it is imposed , " the european commission 's ambassador to the united states , john bruton , said . other eu objections , especially in countries where credit cards are less widely used , include the question of how any levy would be paid .
there is a growing sense in brussels , that forcing europeans to pay $ 10 to enter the united states by credit card and online only discriminates against those visitors who neither use the internet nor possess a credit card .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility the $ 10 registration fee , which would last two years before having to be renewed , has been described by us lawmakers as ' nominal . '
they say the money generated by the registration fee , would go towards teaching visitors how to use the electronic registration process as well as other programs to promote travel to the us .
the weakest link another source of tension between the eu and us over the visa waiver program , involves the way the deal is negotiated .
eu officials argue washington should stop negotiating with individual eu countries bilaterally , and instead , work with the european union has a whole .
but washington insiders accuse the eu of hypocrisy , arguing that if eu unity is so important to the europeans , then individual countries benefiting from the visa waiver program should be prepared to give it up in solidarity with those eu member states that continue to be excluded .
us administration officials also insist there are live security threats in europe .
washington clearly views greece as problematic .
it is the only ' old ' eu member state which has been denied the visa waiver program .
us intelligence does not trust greek passport security and is unconvinced by athens ' commitment to fighting terrorism and extremists .
but brussels argues , no eu member state should be left in limbo - and negotiating with one eu country , should mean , negotiating with all .

" every innocent person who is killed in afghanistan is one too many , " merkel told parliamentarians in berlin .
while promising a thorough investigation and a full report on the raid , which is believed to have left dozens of taliban militants as well as civilians dead , merkel slammed critics for drawing premature conclusions .
" i will ensure that we will not put a gloss on anything .
i will also ensure that we will not accept any premature judgments .
and having experienced what i have in recent days , i say very clearly : i will not take this from anyone , either here in germany or from abroad , " she said .
on saturday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner had called the airstrike a " big mistake . "
afghan president hamid karzai had told french daily le figaro in an interview published on monday that the attack was an " error of judgment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike targeted two fuel trucks that were hijacked by taliban militants " militarily necessary and correct " the german defense ministry on monday described the airstrike as " militarily necessary and correct " because it prevented the taliban from using the two hijacked fuel trucks as mobile bombs .
germany defense minister franz josef jung of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- has faced criticism over his information policy as well as calls for him to step down .
his ministry had initially said that the airstrike had only killed taliban militants .
however , on monday jung was forced to acknowledge that he could no longer rule out any civilian casualties , and on tuesday the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan indicated for the first time that civilians were probably killed in the attack , however , without providing any exact casualty figures .
" believing civilians were not in the area , the local isaf commander authorized an airstrike , which destroyed the two fuel trucks , " isaf said in a statement .
" subsequent review has led isaf to believe that along with insurgents , civilians also were killed and injured in the strike . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defence minister jung says the airstrike was necessary not an election campaign with all but one german political party supporting the government 's stance on the afghanistan mission , parliamentarians were quick to affirm on tuesday that the tragic incident would not be exploited as a campaign issue ahead of the sept .
27 national election .
the only party in the bundestag calling for the immediate withdrawal of germany 's 4,200 troops is the left party .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " oskar lafontaine , the co-leader of the opposition left told parliament on tuesday .
however , the left party and its leaders have a reputation in germany for demanding what is currently popular rather than politically expedient .
even before the airstrike controversy , a poll in july showed that up to 69 percent of germans wanted their soldiers to pull out of afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine , co-leader of the left party , wants germany out of afghanistan government remains committed despite the german public 's reservations over the afghanistan mission , the chancellor has refrained from giving any pullout date for german forces , and she also sidestepped the issue during her speech on tuesday .
instead , merkel drew attention to what had brought international forces to the war-torn country in the first place .
" it was afghanistan , controlled by the taliban and al qaeda , that was the breeding ground for the terror of september 11 , " merkel said .
" the september 11 attacks were followed by dreadful attacks in europe - in madrid and in london .
we know too that germany is in their sights ...
the engagement in afghanistan is our reaction to terror .
that 's where it came from , not the other way around . "
merkel also referred to a joint german-british-franco proposal for an international conference this year to pressure the afghan government to take on more responsibilities , enabling the withdrawal of coalition forces .
" for germany , britain and france , this conference is about creating the conditions for developing an internationally agreed handover strategy , " merkel said on tuesday .

the accord is designed to streamline operations for the further integration of the european union . the vote was necessary after the country 's highest court in june ruled that an existing german law intended to allow lawmakers to ratify the treaty had to be amended to give parliament more decision-making powers in brussels .
the lisbon treaty must be ratified by all 27 member states of the european union before it can take effect .
aside from germany , the ratification process must still be completed in ireland , the czech republic and poland .
the legislation , passed on tuesday , now goes to the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , where representatives of germany 's 16 states are scheduled to vote on it on sept .

chancellor angela merkel and the german states think the company 's experience in the car industry puts it in a better position to save more of the 25,000 opel jobs based in germany .

retaining control the head of a pro-business group in chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union , kurt lauk , said gm is unlikely to sell opel to magna because detroit did n't want to pass valuable intellectual property on to magna 's russian partner sberbank .
“ should the russians become co-owners of opel , they 'll get much quicker access to gm 's small-car technology , ” lauk told bloomberg news agency on tuesday .
“ i 'm convinced that would pose a fundamental problem to the new board . ”
lauk , who is also a former board member of daimlerchrysler and audi , said it would be “ commercially wise ” for gm to dismiss both bids and keep opel for itself , using a “ restructuring plan ” to secure the us giant 's presence in the european and russian markets .

german deputy economy minister jochen homann said tuesday that gm would need to present a robust business strategy if it wanted to keep opel .
" ' we are keeping opel ' is not a strategy yet , " he said on the sidelines of an energy conference .

the strategic partnership between both countries was first launched last year and gives brazil more clout in latin america . the partnership covers the production of 50 helicopters , four conventional submarines and the development of the first brazilian nuclear submarine , even though the contract explicitly excludes the transfer of french nuclear know-how .
there are also investments planned in industrial and harbour facilities .
the project will cost the brazilian government around 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.4 billion -rrb- and will be financed by a consortium made up of six european banks .
the military cooperation includes the purchase of 36 french fighter planes , a deal that will give brazil one of the most advanced combat aircraft in latin america .
a valuable investment ?
however , german defence experts are sceptical about the military cooperation .
they believe the billion-euro treaty , which will boost brazil 's military capacity , could trigger an arms race on the continent , without bringing the advantages , which the brazilian government expects .
" right now it is hard to say whether this project will be successful indeed from a technological perspective and whether it will give brazil military advantages compared to other countries .
an ambitious project like this can also turn out to be a failure , " says ottfried nassauer , who is the head of the berlin information center for transatlantic security .
according to nassauer the cooperation with france should not cause any concern for the neighboring countries , as the understanding among the governments on the continent is good .
but he thinks that the money could be invested better elsewhere .
" the question which luiz inacio lula da silva 's government should ask is whether the investments are not too high and whether it is worth it , to spend such large amounts of money for its own political and military status .
there are many other social and economical fields , where the same kind of money most likely would create many more jobs and possibly lead to more transfer of technology .
military technology always costs more than civil technology , " says nassauer .
regional predominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bilateral deal could anger some of brazil 's regional neighbors political scientist daniel flemes , who is an expert for defence politics with the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg , fears that the cooperation with france can cause problems for the cooperation with latin american neighbors and lead to a regional arms race .
" the fact that brazil gains technological know-how out of partnerships outside of latin america , could trigger an arms race on the continent and hinder defence cooperation with the neighbouring countries , " flemes says .
he believes that brazil not only wants to secure its regional predominance with the contract , but is also striving to become a super power . " the country is trying to stabilise its regional predominance , not only on an economical and political , but on a military level as well .
simultaneously it wishes to expand its influence as an emerging country internationally , " flemes says .
but he also thinks brazil 's ambitions are a natural development , as some of its neighbors are expanding their military strength as well .
" some neighboring countries are modernising their military infrastructure .
venezuela spent four billion euros in the last four or five years on arms imports from russia .
also chile has increased its defence budget over the past years .
so brazil does n't stand alone with its military investments .
over the past five years time the total amount of defence expenditure in south america has more than doubled , " say flemes .

the strategic partnership between both countries was first launched last year and gives brazil more clout in latin america . the partnership covers the production of 50 helicopters , four conventional submarines and the development of the first brazilian nuclear submarine , even though the contract explicitly excludes the transfer of french nuclear know-how .
there are also investments planned in industrial and harbour facilities .
the project will cost the brazilian government around 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.4 billion -rrb- and will be financed by a consortium made up of six european banks .
the military cooperation includes the purchase of 36 french fighter planes , a deal that will give brazil one of the most advanced combat aircraft in latin america .
a valuable investment ?
however , german defence experts are sceptical about the military cooperation .
they believe the billion-euro treaty , which will boost brazil 's military capacity , could trigger an arms race on the continent , without bringing the advantages , which the brazilian government expects .
" right now it is hard to say whether this project will be successful indeed from a technological perspective and whether it will give brazil military advantages compared to other countries .
an ambitious project like this can also turn out to be a failure , " says ottfried nassauer , who is the head of the berlin information center for transatlantic security .
according to nassauer the cooperation with france should not cause any concern for the neighboring countries , as the understanding among the governments on the continent is good .
but he thinks that the money could be invested better elsewhere .
" the question which luiz inacio lula da silva 's government should ask is whether the investments are not too high and whether it is worth it , to spend such large amounts of money for its own political and military status .
there are many other social and economical fields , where the same kind of money most likely would create many more jobs and possibly lead to more transfer of technology .
military technology always costs more than civil technology , " says nassauer .
regional predominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bilateral deal could anger some of brazil 's regional neighbors political scientist daniel flemes , who is an expert for defence politics with the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg , fears that the cooperation with france can cause problems for the cooperation with latin american neighbors and lead to a regional arms race .
" the fact that brazil gains technological know-how out of partnerships outside of latin america , could trigger an arms race on the continent and hinder defence cooperation with the neighbouring countries , " flemes says .
he believes that brazil not only wants to secure its regional predominance with the contract , but is also striving to become a super power . " the country is trying to stabilise its regional predominance , not only on an economical and political , but on a military level as well .
simultaneously it wishes to expand its influence as an emerging country internationally , " flemes says .
but he also thinks brazil 's ambitions are a natural development , as some of its neighbors are expanding their military strength as well .
" some neighboring countries are modernising their military infrastructure .
venezuela spent four billion euros in the last four or five years on arms imports from russia .

so brazil does n't stand alone with its military investments .
over the past five years time the total amount of defence expenditure in south america has more than doubled , " say flemes .

but decisions over details of the new monument in berlin have caused some controversy . the monument , which bears the inscription " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom , " is located near the headquarters of the defense ministry in berlin .
some critics have said it should be located closer to germany 's parliament building - in a different part of the city - as the german army is officially the parliament 's army .
" the soldiers would have picked out another place for their monument .
they would have wanted it to be in a more prominent place , such as near the reichstag building , " said reinhold robbe , the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces .
" in the end , only the parliament decides when and where soldiers are going to be sent to serve . "
the german army , or bundeswehr , was founded in 1955 , and to date , around 3,100 service members have died while in active duty .
manner of death an issue although the monument 's opening comes at a time when a growing number of german soldiers are being killed in afghanistan , the monument does not differentiate between soldiers and civilian employees of the army who lost their lives due to accidents or suicide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meck and a model of his memorial reinhard fuerher is the president of the german war graves commission and thinks a distinction should be made .
" there 's a big difference between someone in the bundeswehr who is killed because of a careless accident and someone who was sent by the german parliament into a war-like situation , " fuerher said .
" accidents , suicide - it 's all a part of this , " counters robbe .
" for the loved ones of a dead soldier it 's still a bad thing when someone loses their life . "
a modern memorial the plans for a monument for german soldiers killed in service has been around for some time .
the idea came to defense minister franz-josef jung during a visit to afghanistan in 2005 .
there , german soldiers had erected their own monument to their fallen comrades .
despite criticism from members of parliament , jung has always been adamant that the memorial be placed near the headquarters of the bundeswehr .
while the location and the exact meaning of the monument have led to debate , the monument itself has been widely accepted .
munich-based architect andreas meck is the architect of the memorial and presented his plan in 2007 .
construction officially began with a groundbreaking ceremony last november .
the final structure is about 40 meters -lrb- 131 feet -rrb- long and is supported by columns .
a computer screen cycles through the names of dead soldiers , briefly displaying each one before blending in the next .

german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung on tuesday that he hoped gm would lay out a clear course of action before the iaa international motor show opens in frankfurt on sept .
17 .
but the handelsblatt financial daily quoted sources close to the opel talks as saying gm is likely to postpone its decision again and wait until after the german federal election on sept .
27 before making any announcement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg wants gm to announce its plans by sept .
17 negotiations on opel have already gone on for months , with issues of state funding and potential job losses turning the sale into a political hot potato ahead of the election .
berlin 's favored bidder is canadian auto parts maker magna .
chancellor angela merkel and the german states think the company 's experience in the car industry puts it in a better position to save more of the 25,000 opel jobs based in germany .
but gm has signaled it would prefer to sell its european unit to belgian-based investment group rhj international , or perhaps even keep the business for itself .
retaining control the head of a pro-business group in chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union , kurt lauk , said gm is unlikely to sell opel to magna because detroit did n't want to pass valuable intellectual property on to magna 's russian partner sberbank .
“ should the russians become co-owners of opel , they 'll get much quicker access to gm 's small-car technology , ” lauk told bloomberg news agency on tuesday .
“ i 'm convinced that would pose a fundamental problem to the new board . ”
lauk , who is also a former board member of daimlerchrysler and audi , said it would be “ commercially wise ” for gm to dismiss both bids and keep opel for itself , using a “ restructuring plan ” to secure the us giant 's presence in the european and russian markets .
softening stance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm is unhappy with magna 's ties to russian bank sberbank recent media reports suggest the german government may have softened its stance on the prospect of gm retaining control of opel .
last week an unnamed german government source told dow jones newswires that berlin would be open to gm keeping opel , as long as it invests its own capital in the company .
german deputy economy minister jochen homann said tuesday that gm would need to present a robust business strategy if it wanted to keep opel .
" ' we are keeping opel ' is not a strategy yet , " he said on the sidelines of an energy conference .
" we have laid the groundwork in the direction of magna , " homann said , reiterating the german government 's support for a deal with magna. sje / afp / dpa / reuters editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de experts see five possible solutions to the opel drama like a soap opera entering its 15th season , the opel saga took a twist this week when it was revealed that general motors had turned down magna 's offer for the firm .

development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "
his advice is that , " we should support independent african solutions only . "
exception to the rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benin 's president , thomas yayi boni , has tried to crack down on corruption that is exactly what hubi and vinciane , a small belgian aid organisation , does in the republic of benin .
talking to deutsche welle chairman piet van assche confirms that their approach is different : " in almost 30 years in benin we never took any initiative of our own .
we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .
but the author distinguishes between rich and poor .
" i do n't condemn the policeman , who collects a bribe on the side of the road .
i do n't condemn the poor , who are often desperate to survive .
i condemn the political elites , who do n't give a damn about the people . "
paul banoba from transparency international in berlin , which studies and fights corruption worldwide , disagrees .
" you can not just blame the top , " he says in an interview with deutsche welle .
" in comparing corrupt policemen with corrupt politicians volker seitz may want to make a distinction between petty corruption and large-scale corruption .
but we define corruption as an evil in itself , at whatever level it occurs .
there is corruption at every level , it is widespread . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money makes the world go round especially for africa 's political elites it 's not easy to talk about corruption .
doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , which is represented in nearly all african countries , turned down deutsche welle 's interview request , arguing that , " msf is not involved in corruption , never deals with officials who expect a personal benefit and therefore hardly can answer the questions .
msf is neutral and does not officially blame others without being involved itself . "
piet van assche from hubi and vinciane says his company has managed to stay clear of any allegations of corruption : " to my knowledge we 've never had anything to do with corruption . "
democracy and its many faces van assche says that the transition of power in benin has gone smoothly since he started working there in the mid-eighties .
but volker seitz warns that european democracy does n't always fit into an african environment : " it 's difficult to transfer our western parliamentarian system to africa .
what counts is the political will to improve the standard of living .
education is important .
human rights must be respected .
those things , i believe , are not negotiable , but it does n't have to be parliamentarian democracy as we know it . "

the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .

well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "

with 91.6 percent of votes counted , president hamid karzai has an absolute majority of 54.1 percent . this is the first time that the figures show that president hamid karzai has enough votes to win in a single round and avoid a runoff poll .
figures released by afghanistan 's independent electoral commission -lrb- iec -rrb- give karzai a commanding lead with 54.1 percent , with 91.6 percent of all votes counted so far .
karzai 's nearest rival , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , is well behind with 28.3 percent .
nearly 5.5 million valid votes have been counted so far , the iec said .
karzai has 2,959,093 votes against abdullah 's 1,546,490 , the electoral commission announced at a news conference on tuesday .
the electoral commission announced on sunday that it had discarded around 200,000 ballots from 447 polling sites nationally where it had found vote fraud .
partial recount ordered on tuesday , the un-backed independent election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- said it too had clear evidence of fraud in the election . the body said it received more than 2,000 complaints , about a third of which could impact the final result .
" in the course of its investigations , the election complaints commission has found clear and convincing evidence of fraud in a number of polling stations , " the ecc said in a statement .
it did not say which candidate gained from the fraud , or where the suspicious ballots had been cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans voted amid taliban threats of violence the ecc has ordered the electoral commission to review votes from 600 more polling stations .
these include stations where a single candidate received more than 95 percent of the votes and those where more than 600 votes were cast , the most that could be cast a single station .
polling stations with suspiciously high voter participation , given a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , are also to be reviewed .
the low turnout , accredited to taliban voter intimidation and violence , is also threatening to cast doubt on the credibility of the process and the legitimacy of the winner .
preliminary results from 100 percent of votes cast across the country are expected to be announced on thursday .
karzai must have 50 percent of all ballots cast , plus one extra ballot , to be declared the winner .
final official results are not due before sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 08.09.2009 corrupt political elites block development in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's corrupt political elites are leaving their people to suffer african leaders are responsible for the problems in their countries , and not former colonial powers .
development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "
his advice is that , " we should support independent african solutions only . "
exception to the rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benin 's president , thomas yayi boni , has tried to crack down on corruption that is exactly what hubi and vinciane , a small belgian aid organisation , does in the republic of benin .
talking to deutsche welle chairman piet van assche confirms that their approach is different : " in almost 30 years in benin we never took any initiative of our own .
we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .
but the author distinguishes between rich and poor .
" i do n't condemn the policeman , who collects a bribe on the side of the road .
i do n't condemn the poor , who are often desperate to survive .
i condemn the political elites , who do n't give a damn about the people . "
paul banoba from transparency international in berlin , which studies and fights corruption worldwide , disagrees .
" you can not just blame the top , " he says in an interview with deutsche welle .
" in comparing corrupt policemen with corrupt politicians volker seitz may want to make a distinction between petty corruption and large-scale corruption .
but we define corruption as an evil in itself , at whatever level it occurs .
there is corruption at every level , it is widespread . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money makes the world go round especially for africa 's political elites it 's not easy to talk about corruption .
doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , which is represented in nearly all african countries , turned down deutsche welle 's interview request , arguing that , " msf is not involved in corruption , never deals with officials who expect a personal benefit and therefore hardly can answer the questions .
msf is neutral and does not officially blame others without being involved itself . "
piet van assche from hubi and vinciane says his company has managed to stay clear of any allegations of corruption : " to my knowledge we 've never had anything to do with corruption . "
democracy and its many faces van assche says that the transition of power in benin has gone smoothly since he started working there in the mid-eighties .
but volker seitz warns that european democracy does n't always fit into an african environment : " it 's difficult to transfer our western parliamentarian system to africa .
what counts is the political will to improve the standard of living .
education is important .
human rights must be respected .
those things , i believe , are not negotiable , but it does n't have to be parliamentarian democracy as we know it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 08.09.2009 europe slams us plans for new tourist levy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility european travelers entering the us may be faced with a new levy in the future .
the plans by us lawmakers could trigger a trans-atlantic tit-for-tat response with travelers on both sides footing the bill . the european union has raised objections over us plans to introduce a $ 10 charge for travelers entering the us .
if the planned levy is deemed equivalent to a visa , eu lawmakers might decide to retaliate , by forcing entry-visas on us visitors to the 27-member bloc .
currently , 29 european countries are part of the us visa waiver program -lrb- among 35 countries worldwide -rrb- , permitting european tourists to enter the united states without a visa .
however , the us introduced an online registration process earlier this year , requiring european visitors to confirm their visa-free status , three days before their departure - a move that irritated eu officials in brussels at the time .
the european commission signaled that if the us changed the requirements of its electronic system for travel authorization -lrb- esta -rrb- , the eu might be forced to review its own position .
" the introduction of a fee by the us , would require a new assessment of the european commission ... to evaluate whether the esta system , is tantamount to a visa or not , " said commission spokesman michele cercone .
scanning for terrorists eu officials believe a fee would also discourage european visitors from registering online , which - as cercone argued - would undermine the security objectives of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe may retaliate if the us introduces its $ 10 levy " the introduction of such a fee would constitute a step backward in our joint endeavor to ease transatlantic mobility , " cercone said .
that argument resonates with european civil liberties groups , which see the electronic registration process - with or without a fee - as an invasion of privacy rights .
they say the us has no right to the personal information of eu citizens .
the us argues that information is crucial in the fight against terrorism .
washington says the system gives us intelligence officials a 72 hours ' heads-up ' if unwanted visitors -lrb- or would-be terrorists -rrb- are planning to travel to the us .
officials in brussels are reluctant to comment further , stressing the plan to introduce a $ 10 charge is still being debated in washington .
but other eu representatives have been less cautious .
" only in ' alice in wonderland ' could a penalty be seen as promoting the activity on which it is imposed , " the european commission 's ambassador to the united states , john bruton , said . other eu objections , especially in countries where credit cards are less widely used , include the question of how any levy would be paid .
there is a growing sense in brussels , that forcing europeans to pay $ 10 to enter the united states by credit card and online only discriminates against those visitors who neither use the internet nor possess a credit card .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility the $ 10 registration fee , which would last two years before having to be renewed , has been described by us lawmakers as ' nominal . '
they say the money generated by the registration fee , would go towards teaching visitors how to use the electronic registration process as well as other programs to promote travel to the us .
the weakest link another source of tension between the eu and us over the visa waiver program , involves the way the deal is negotiated .
eu officials argue washington should stop negotiating with individual eu countries bilaterally , and instead , work with the european union has a whole .
but washington insiders accuse the eu of hypocrisy , arguing that if eu unity is so important to the europeans , then individual countries benefiting from the visa waiver program should be prepared to give it up in solidarity with those eu member states that continue to be excluded .
us administration officials also insist there are live security threats in europe .
washington clearly views greece as problematic .
it is the only ' old ' eu member state which has been denied the visa waiver program .
us intelligence does not trust greek passport security and is unconvinced by athens ' commitment to fighting terrorism and extremists .
but brussels argues , no eu member state should be left in limbo - and negotiating with one eu country , should mean , negotiating with all .

with 91.6 percent of votes counted , president hamid karzai has an absolute majority of 54.1 percent . this is the first time that the figures show that president hamid karzai has enough votes to win in a single round and avoid a runoff poll .
figures released by afghanistan 's independent electoral commission -lrb- iec -rrb- give karzai a commanding lead with 54.1 percent , with 91.6 percent of all votes counted so far .
karzai 's nearest rival , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , is well behind with 28.3 percent .
nearly 5.5 million valid votes have been counted so far , the iec said .
karzai has 2,959,093 votes against abdullah 's 1,546,490 , the electoral commission announced at a news conference on tuesday .
the electoral commission announced on sunday that it had discarded around 200,000 ballots from 447 polling sites nationally where it had found vote fraud .
partial recount ordered on tuesday , the un-backed independent election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- said it too had clear evidence of fraud in the election . the body said it received more than 2,000 complaints , about a third of which could impact the final result .
" in the course of its investigations , the election complaints commission has found clear and convincing evidence of fraud in a number of polling stations , " the ecc said in a statement .
it did not say which candidate gained from the fraud , or where the suspicious ballots had been cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans voted amid taliban threats of violence the ecc has ordered the electoral commission to review votes from 600 more polling stations .
these include stations where a single candidate received more than 95 percent of the votes and those where more than 600 votes were cast , the most that could be cast a single station .
polling stations with suspiciously high voter participation , given a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , are also to be reviewed .
the low turnout , accredited to taliban voter intimidation and violence , is also threatening to cast doubt on the credibility of the process and the legitimacy of the winner .
preliminary results from 100 percent of votes cast across the country are expected to be announced on thursday .
karzai must have 50 percent of all ballots cast , plus one extra ballot , to be declared the winner .
final official results are not due before sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.09.2009 ruettgers ' romania slur meant to placate the far right , author says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers relies on inflammatory rhetoric , according to georgescu romanian-born writer vlad georgescu has filed charges of sedition and defamation against the premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia .
he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

the country has to make sure students are literate , one expert told dw . as the world observes world literacy day , there are estimated to be 776 million people who are unable to read or write , according to the united nations .
that statistic led un secretary-general ban ki-moon to call for increased effort in the fight to end illiteracy . " in a world of enormous wealth and in a world where education and knowledge are the keys to a better life , the extent of global illiteracy is shocking , " he said .
" education gives people the tools they need to improve their living situation and take part in public decision making . " while the days of marking official documents with an " x " are long past for the vast majority of germans , not being able to read or write remains a problem that is growing more acute as jobs requiring few skills dry up , according to peter hubertus , the head of germany 's federal literacy association . " there are still people with limited reading and writing skills , and for a long time that has not been a large problem - even for the people who could not read or write at all , " he told deutsche welle .
" but the shift toward a knowledge-based society makes greater educational demands .
it 's clear that a person in germany in 2009 ca n't get by reading and writing at a first or second-grade level . " most functional illiterates attended school bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some students can write only at the most basic of levels hubertus estimated that there are 4 million illiterate people in germany with the reading and writing skills of a primary school student .
the majority of these people attended german schools , which he said posed a major problem for germany as students leave school frustrated and without sufficient basic skills . while numerous courses exist to teach young people how to read and write , it 's difficult to convince many of them how important these skills are . " there are a lot of courses , but we 're unable to reach many young adults , " hubertus said .
" young people tend to be so happy to be finished with school and no longer have to deal with writing .
when they leave school it 's hard to get them involved in a new learning process . " motivating kids to learn but in order for germany to maintain its position as an economic power , schools have to try to keep students from leaving without being able to read or write , according to michael huether , the director of a german economic research institute in cologne . the key to reaching young people is to disguise the learning process with issues they are already involved in , hubertus said , adding that fashion and music have proven to be areas where many illiterate or functionally illiterate teenagers want to make their opinions known . ideally , schools would identify learning deficiencies before kids reach their teens , hubertus said . " we have to strengthen kindergartens , provide better training for teachers and improve primary schools , " he said .
" there needs to be more individualized learning so students are supported step by step .
all this has to happen with topics that are interesting for each of the various age groups . " klaus gehrke -lrb- sms / dpa / ap -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 08.09.2009 europe slams us plans for new tourist levy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility european travelers entering the us may be faced with a new levy in the future .
the plans by us lawmakers could trigger a trans-atlantic tit-for-tat response with travelers on both sides footing the bill . the european union has raised objections over us plans to introduce a $ 10 charge for travelers entering the us .
if the planned levy is deemed equivalent to a visa , eu lawmakers might decide to retaliate , by forcing entry-visas on us visitors to the 27-member bloc .
currently , 29 european countries are part of the us visa waiver program -lrb- among 35 countries worldwide -rrb- , permitting european tourists to enter the united states without a visa .
however , the us introduced an online registration process earlier this year , requiring european visitors to confirm their visa-free status , three days before their departure - a move that irritated eu officials in brussels at the time .
the european commission signaled that if the us changed the requirements of its electronic system for travel authorization -lrb- esta -rrb- , the eu might be forced to review its own position .
" the introduction of a fee by the us , would require a new assessment of the european commission ... to evaluate whether the esta system , is tantamount to a visa or not , " said commission spokesman michele cercone .
scanning for terrorists eu officials believe a fee would also discourage european visitors from registering online , which - as cercone argued - would undermine the security objectives of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe may retaliate if the us introduces its $ 10 levy " the introduction of such a fee would constitute a step backward in our joint endeavor to ease transatlantic mobility , " cercone said .
that argument resonates with european civil liberties groups , which see the electronic registration process - with or without a fee - as an invasion of privacy rights .
they say the us has no right to the personal information of eu citizens .
the us argues that information is crucial in the fight against terrorism .
washington says the system gives us intelligence officials a 72 hours ' heads-up ' if unwanted visitors -lrb- or would-be terrorists -rrb- are planning to travel to the us .
officials in brussels are reluctant to comment further , stressing the plan to introduce a $ 10 charge is still being debated in washington .
but other eu representatives have been less cautious .
" only in ' alice in wonderland ' could a penalty be seen as promoting the activity on which it is imposed , " the european commission 's ambassador to the united states , john bruton , said . other eu objections , especially in countries where credit cards are less widely used , include the question of how any levy would be paid .
there is a growing sense in brussels , that forcing europeans to pay $ 10 to enter the united states by credit card and online only discriminates against those visitors who neither use the internet nor possess a credit card .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility the $ 10 registration fee , which would last two years before having to be renewed , has been described by us lawmakers as ' nominal . '
they say the money generated by the registration fee , would go towards teaching visitors how to use the electronic registration process as well as other programs to promote travel to the us .
the weakest link another source of tension between the eu and us over the visa waiver program , involves the way the deal is negotiated .
eu officials argue washington should stop negotiating with individual eu countries bilaterally , and instead , work with the european union has a whole .
but washington insiders accuse the eu of hypocrisy , arguing that if eu unity is so important to the europeans , then individual countries benefiting from the visa waiver program should be prepared to give it up in solidarity with those eu member states that continue to be excluded .
us administration officials also insist there are live security threats in europe .
washington clearly views greece as problematic .
it is the only ' old ' eu member state which has been denied the visa waiver program .
us intelligence does not trust greek passport security and is unconvinced by athens ' commitment to fighting terrorism and extremists .
but brussels argues , no eu member state should be left in limbo - and negotiating with one eu country , should mean , negotiating with all .

" every innocent person who is killed in afghanistan is one too many , " merkel told parliamentarians in berlin .
while promising a thorough investigation and a full report on the raid , which is believed to have left dozens of taliban militants as well as civilians dead , merkel slammed critics for drawing premature conclusions .
" i will ensure that we will not put a gloss on anything .
i will also ensure that we will not accept any premature judgments .
and having experienced what i have in recent days , i say very clearly : i will not take this from anyone , either here in germany or from abroad , " she said .
on saturday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner had called the airstrike a " big mistake . "
afghan president hamid karzai had told french daily le figaro in an interview published on monday that the attack was an " error of judgment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike targeted two fuel trucks that were hijacked by taliban militants " militarily necessary and correct " the german defense ministry on monday described the airstrike as " militarily necessary and correct " because it prevented the taliban from using the two hijacked fuel trucks as mobile bombs .
germany defense minister franz josef jung of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- has faced criticism over his information policy as well as calls for him to step down .
his ministry had initially said that the airstrike had only killed taliban militants .
however , on monday jung was forced to acknowledge that he could no longer rule out any civilian casualties , and on tuesday the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan indicated for the first time that civilians were probably killed in the attack , however , without providing any exact casualty figures .
" believing civilians were not in the area , the local isaf commander authorized an airstrike , which destroyed the two fuel trucks , " isaf said in a statement .
" subsequent review has led isaf to believe that along with insurgents , civilians also were killed and injured in the strike . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defence minister jung says the airstrike was necessary not an election campaign with all but one german political party supporting the government 's stance on the afghanistan mission , parliamentarians were quick to affirm on tuesday that the tragic incident would not be exploited as a campaign issue ahead of the sept .
27 national election .
the only party in the bundestag calling for the immediate withdrawal of germany 's 4,200 troops is the left party .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " oskar lafontaine , the co-leader of the opposition left told parliament on tuesday .
however , the left party and its leaders have a reputation in germany for demanding what is currently popular rather than politically expedient .
even before the airstrike controversy , a poll in july showed that up to 69 percent of germans wanted their soldiers to pull out of afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine , co-leader of the left party , wants germany out of afghanistan government remains committed despite the german public 's reservations over the afghanistan mission , the chancellor has refrained from giving any pullout date for german forces , and she also sidestepped the issue during her speech on tuesday .
instead , merkel drew attention to what had brought international forces to the war-torn country in the first place .
" it was afghanistan , controlled by the taliban and al qaeda , that was the breeding ground for the terror of september 11 , " merkel said .
" the september 11 attacks were followed by dreadful attacks in europe - in madrid and in london .
we know too that germany is in their sights ...
the engagement in afghanistan is our reaction to terror .
that 's where it came from , not the other way around . "
merkel also referred to a joint german-british-franco proposal for an international conference this year to pressure the afghan government to take on more responsibilities , enabling the withdrawal of coalition forces .
" for germany , britain and france , this conference is about creating the conditions for developing an internationally agreed handover strategy , " merkel said on tuesday .
" our overriding political goal is and remains an afghanistan that can handle its own security . "
it was unclear where and when the conference would be held , but the united nations , which is to host the event , has proposed kabul as the venue. nk / reuters / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .
i do n't see that as a big problem .

one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .
i do n't see that as a big problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 08.09.2009 germany gets its first monument for fallen soldiers since wwii großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monument has been in the works since 2007 no one is debating the gesture to honor dead service members of germany 's armed forces .
but decisions over details of the new monument in berlin have caused some controversy . the monument , which bears the inscription " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom , " is located near the headquarters of the defense ministry in berlin .
some critics have said it should be located closer to germany 's parliament building - in a different part of the city - as the german army is officially the parliament 's army .
" the soldiers would have picked out another place for their monument .
they would have wanted it to be in a more prominent place , such as near the reichstag building , " said reinhold robbe , the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces .
" in the end , only the parliament decides when and where soldiers are going to be sent to serve . "
the german army , or bundeswehr , was founded in 1955 , and to date , around 3,100 service members have died while in active duty .
manner of death an issue although the monument 's opening comes at a time when a growing number of german soldiers are being killed in afghanistan , the monument does not differentiate between soldiers and civilian employees of the army who lost their lives due to accidents or suicide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meck and a model of his memorial reinhard fuerher is the president of the german war graves commission and thinks a distinction should be made .
" there 's a big difference between someone in the bundeswehr who is killed because of a careless accident and someone who was sent by the german parliament into a war-like situation , " fuerher said .
" accidents , suicide - it 's all a part of this , " counters robbe .
" for the loved ones of a dead soldier it 's still a bad thing when someone loses their life . "
a modern memorial the plans for a monument for german soldiers killed in service has been around for some time .
the idea came to defense minister franz-josef jung during a visit to afghanistan in 2005 .
there , german soldiers had erected their own monument to their fallen comrades .
despite criticism from members of parliament , jung has always been adamant that the memorial be placed near the headquarters of the bundeswehr .
while the location and the exact meaning of the monument have led to debate , the monument itself has been widely accepted .
munich-based architect andreas meck is the architect of the memorial and presented his plan in 2007 .
construction officially began with a groundbreaking ceremony last november .
the final structure is about 40 meters -lrb- 131 feet -rrb- long and is supported by columns .
a computer screen cycles through the names of dead soldiers , briefly displaying each one before blending in the next .

the plans by us lawmakers could trigger a trans-atlantic tit-for-tat response with travelers on both sides footing the bill . the european union has raised objections over us plans to introduce a $ 10 charge for travelers entering the us .
if the planned levy is deemed equivalent to a visa , eu lawmakers might decide to retaliate , by forcing entry-visas on us visitors to the 27-member bloc .
currently , 29 european countries are part of the us visa waiver program -lrb- among 35 countries worldwide -rrb- , permitting european tourists to enter the united states without a visa .
however , the us introduced an online registration process earlier this year , requiring european visitors to confirm their visa-free status , three days before their departure - a move that irritated eu officials in brussels at the time .
the european commission signaled that if the us changed the requirements of its electronic system for travel authorization -lrb- esta -rrb- , the eu might be forced to review its own position .
" the introduction of a fee by the us , would require a new assessment of the european commission ... to evaluate whether the esta system , is tantamount to a visa or not , " said commission spokesman michele cercone .
scanning for terrorists eu officials believe a fee would also discourage european visitors from registering online , which - as cercone argued - would undermine the security objectives of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe may retaliate if the us introduces its $ 10 levy " the introduction of such a fee would constitute a step backward in our joint endeavor to ease transatlantic mobility , " cercone said .
that argument resonates with european civil liberties groups , which see the electronic registration process - with or without a fee - as an invasion of privacy rights .
they say the us has no right to the personal information of eu citizens .
the us argues that information is crucial in the fight against terrorism .
washington says the system gives us intelligence officials a 72 hours ' heads-up ' if unwanted visitors -lrb- or would-be terrorists -rrb- are planning to travel to the us .
officials in brussels are reluctant to comment further , stressing the plan to introduce a $ 10 charge is still being debated in washington .
but other eu representatives have been less cautious .
" only in ' alice in wonderland ' could a penalty be seen as promoting the activity on which it is imposed , " the european commission 's ambassador to the united states , john bruton , said . other eu objections , especially in countries where credit cards are less widely used , include the question of how any levy would be paid .
there is a growing sense in brussels , that forcing europeans to pay $ 10 to enter the united states by credit card and online only discriminates against those visitors who neither use the internet nor possess a credit card .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility the $ 10 registration fee , which would last two years before having to be renewed , has been described by us lawmakers as ' nominal . '
they say the money generated by the registration fee , would go towards teaching visitors how to use the electronic registration process as well as other programs to promote travel to the us .
the weakest link another source of tension between the eu and us over the visa waiver program , involves the way the deal is negotiated .
eu officials argue washington should stop negotiating with individual eu countries bilaterally , and instead , work with the european union has a whole .
but washington insiders accuse the eu of hypocrisy , arguing that if eu unity is so important to the europeans , then individual countries benefiting from the visa waiver program should be prepared to give it up in solidarity with those eu member states that continue to be excluded .
us administration officials also insist there are live security threats in europe .
washington clearly views greece as problematic .
it is the only ' old ' eu member state which has been denied the visa waiver program .
us intelligence does not trust greek passport security and is unconvinced by athens ' commitment to fighting terrorism and extremists .
but brussels argues , no eu member state should be left in limbo - and negotiating with one eu country , should mean , negotiating with all .

" every innocent person who is killed in afghanistan is one too many , " merkel told parliamentarians in berlin .
while promising a thorough investigation and a full report on the raid , which is believed to have left dozens of taliban militants as well as civilians dead , merkel slammed critics for drawing premature conclusions .
" i will ensure that we will not put a gloss on anything .
i will also ensure that we will not accept any premature judgments .

on saturday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner had called the airstrike a " big mistake . "
afghan president hamid karzai had told french daily le figaro in an interview published on monday that the attack was an " error of judgment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike targeted two fuel trucks that were hijacked by taliban militants " militarily necessary and correct " the german defense ministry on monday described the airstrike as " militarily necessary and correct " because it prevented the taliban from using the two hijacked fuel trucks as mobile bombs .
germany defense minister franz josef jung of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- has faced criticism over his information policy as well as calls for him to step down .
his ministry had initially said that the airstrike had only killed taliban militants .
however , on monday jung was forced to acknowledge that he could no longer rule out any civilian casualties , and on tuesday the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan indicated for the first time that civilians were probably killed in the attack , however , without providing any exact casualty figures .
" believing civilians were not in the area , the local isaf commander authorized an airstrike , which destroyed the two fuel trucks , " isaf said in a statement .
" subsequent review has led isaf to believe that along with insurgents , civilians also were killed and injured in the strike . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defence minister jung says the airstrike was necessary not an election campaign with all but one german political party supporting the government 's stance on the afghanistan mission , parliamentarians were quick to affirm on tuesday that the tragic incident would not be exploited as a campaign issue ahead of the sept .

" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " oskar lafontaine , the co-leader of the opposition left told parliament on tuesday .
however , the left party and its leaders have a reputation in germany for demanding what is currently popular rather than politically expedient .
even before the airstrike controversy , a poll in july showed that up to 69 percent of germans wanted their soldiers to pull out of afghanistan .

instead , merkel drew attention to what had brought international forces to the war-torn country in the first place .
" it was afghanistan , controlled by the taliban and al qaeda , that was the breeding ground for the terror of september 11 , " merkel said .
" the september 11 attacks were followed by dreadful attacks in europe - in madrid and in london .

merkel also referred to a joint german-british-franco proposal for an international conference this year to pressure the afghan government to take on more responsibilities , enabling the withdrawal of coalition forces .

but decisions over details of the new monument in berlin have caused some controversy . the monument , which bears the inscription " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom , " is located near the headquarters of the defense ministry in berlin .
some critics have said it should be located closer to germany 's parliament building - in a different part of the city - as the german army is officially the parliament 's army .
" the soldiers would have picked out another place for their monument .
they would have wanted it to be in a more prominent place , such as near the reichstag building , " said reinhold robbe , the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces .
" in the end , only the parliament decides when and where soldiers are going to be sent to serve . "
the german army , or bundeswehr , was founded in 1955 , and to date , around 3,100 service members have died while in active duty .
manner of death an issue although the monument 's opening comes at a time when a growing number of german soldiers are being killed in afghanistan , the monument does not differentiate between soldiers and civilian employees of the army who lost their lives due to accidents or suicide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meck and a model of his memorial reinhard fuerher is the president of the german war graves commission and thinks a distinction should be made .
" there 's a big difference between someone in the bundeswehr who is killed because of a careless accident and someone who was sent by the german parliament into a war-like situation , " fuerher said .
" accidents , suicide - it 's all a part of this , " counters robbe .
" for the loved ones of a dead soldier it 's still a bad thing when someone loses their life . "
a modern memorial the plans for a monument for german soldiers killed in service has been around for some time .
the idea came to defense minister franz-josef jung during a visit to afghanistan in 2005 .
there , german soldiers had erected their own monument to their fallen comrades .
despite criticism from members of parliament , jung has always been adamant that the memorial be placed near the headquarters of the bundeswehr .
while the location and the exact meaning of the monument have led to debate , the monument itself has been widely accepted .
munich-based architect andreas meck is the architect of the memorial and presented his plan in 2007 .
construction officially began with a groundbreaking ceremony last november .
the final structure is about 40 meters -lrb- 131 feet -rrb- long and is supported by columns .
a computer screen cycles through the names of dead soldiers , briefly displaying each one before blending in the next .

but decisions over details of the new monument in berlin have caused some controversy . the monument , which bears the inscription " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom , " is located near the headquarters of the defense ministry in berlin .
some critics have said it should be located closer to germany 's parliament building - in a different part of the city - as the german army is officially the parliament 's army .
" the soldiers would have picked out another place for their monument .
they would have wanted it to be in a more prominent place , such as near the reichstag building , " said reinhold robbe , the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces .
" in the end , only the parliament decides when and where soldiers are going to be sent to serve . "
the german army , or bundeswehr , was founded in 1955 , and to date , around 3,100 service members have died while in active duty .
manner of death an issue although the monument 's opening comes at a time when a growing number of german soldiers are being killed in afghanistan , the monument does not differentiate between soldiers and civilian employees of the army who lost their lives due to accidents or suicide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meck and a model of his memorial reinhard fuerher is the president of the german war graves commission and thinks a distinction should be made .
" there 's a big difference between someone in the bundeswehr who is killed because of a careless accident and someone who was sent by the german parliament into a war-like situation , " fuerher said .
" accidents , suicide - it 's all a part of this , " counters robbe .
" for the loved ones of a dead soldier it 's still a bad thing when someone loses their life . "
a modern memorial the plans for a monument for german soldiers killed in service has been around for some time .
the idea came to defense minister franz-josef jung during a visit to afghanistan in 2005 .
there , german soldiers had erected their own monument to their fallen comrades .
despite criticism from members of parliament , jung has always been adamant that the memorial be placed near the headquarters of the bundeswehr .
while the location and the exact meaning of the monument have led to debate , the monument itself has been widely accepted .
munich-based architect andreas meck is the architect of the memorial and presented his plan in 2007 .
construction officially began with a groundbreaking ceremony last november .
the final structure is about 40 meters -lrb- 131 feet -rrb- long and is supported by columns .
a computer screen cycles through the names of dead soldiers , briefly displaying each one before blending in the next .

the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumann 's death sentence became a prison sentence germany 's major political parties had first declined to support the current legislation because it was brought before parliament by the left party .
many of the party 's leading figures were once members of the communist party of former east germany .
the parties finally agreed to sponsor the bill when the left party removed itself from the list of backers .
arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .
but a justice ministry review headed by hans hugo klein , a former judge at the constitutional court , established that the nazis ' treason law was a merciless instrument of repression , and was so vague that it gave room to arbitrary rulings .
rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .
since then he has fought an uphill battle against prejudice and bureaucracy to see the records wiped clean .
he is the sole survivor of the group who initiated the association 20 years ago .
" i did n't want to be part of it any longer " baumann was an infantryman in occupied france when he deserted his regiment in 1942 .
he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .
his sentence was converted to 12 years imprisonment , and he was sent to the army prison in torgau , germany .
he survived , but when he returned to germany after the war , he found that the stigma of treason clung to him .
" i received many death threats .
we were treated like as cowards , scumbags and traitors .
no one was on our side . "
one group left to fight for it took years before opinion started to turn .
finally , in 1998 and 2002 , laws were passed that rehabilitated conscientious objectors , those found guilty of undermining the war effort , spies and deserters – among them baumann himself .
that left the small group of those charged with military treason - and baumann continued his battle on their behalf , despite the fact that his own honor had been restored .
according to baumann , 68 death sentences were handed down for wartime treason , and they were all executed but for one .
general walther von seydlitz-kurzbach survived because he was by that time a russian prisoner of war .
baumann is pleased that parliament is about to close one of the last chapter 's of nazi military arbitrariness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 08.09.2009 german analyst plays down trans-atlantic rift over airstrike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of germans in afghanistan is a bone of contention a nato airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan 's kunduz province may have sparked a rift between berlin and washington .
one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 08.09.2009 german analyst plays down trans-atlantic rift over airstrike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of germans in afghanistan is a bone of contention a nato airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan 's kunduz province may have sparked a rift between berlin and washington .
one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .

the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .

arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .

rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .
since then he has fought an uphill battle against prejudice and bureaucracy to see the records wiped clean .
he is the sole survivor of the group who initiated the association 20 years ago .
" i did n't want to be part of it any longer " baumann was an infantryman in occupied france when he deserted his regiment in 1942 .
he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .

the country has to make sure students are literate , one expert told dw . as the world observes world literacy day , there are estimated to be 776 million people who are unable to read or write , according to the united nations .
that statistic led un secretary-general ban ki-moon to call for increased effort in the fight to end illiteracy . " in a world of enormous wealth and in a world where education and knowledge are the keys to a better life , the extent of global illiteracy is shocking , " he said .
" education gives people the tools they need to improve their living situation and take part in public decision making . " while the days of marking official documents with an " x " are long past for the vast majority of germans , not being able to read or write remains a problem that is growing more acute as jobs requiring few skills dry up , according to peter hubertus , the head of germany 's federal literacy association . " there are still people with limited reading and writing skills , and for a long time that has not been a large problem - even for the people who could not read or write at all , " he told deutsche welle .
" but the shift toward a knowledge-based society makes greater educational demands .
it 's clear that a person in germany in 2009 ca n't get by reading and writing at a first or second-grade level . " most functional illiterates attended school bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some students can write only at the most basic of levels hubertus estimated that there are 4 million illiterate people in germany with the reading and writing skills of a primary school student .
the majority of these people attended german schools , which he said posed a major problem for germany as students leave school frustrated and without sufficient basic skills . while numerous courses exist to teach young people how to read and write , it 's difficult to convince many of them how important these skills are . " there are a lot of courses , but we 're unable to reach many young adults , " hubertus said .
" young people tend to be so happy to be finished with school and no longer have to deal with writing .
when they leave school it 's hard to get them involved in a new learning process . " motivating kids to learn but in order for germany to maintain its position as an economic power , schools have to try to keep students from leaving without being able to read or write , according to michael huether , the director of a german economic research institute in cologne . the key to reaching young people is to disguise the learning process with issues they are already involved in , hubertus said , adding that fashion and music have proven to be areas where many illiterate or functionally illiterate teenagers want to make their opinions known . ideally , schools would identify learning deficiencies before kids reach their teens , hubertus said . " we have to strengthen kindergartens , provide better training for teachers and improve primary schools , " he said .
" there needs to be more individualized learning so students are supported step by step .
all this has to happen with topics that are interesting for each of the various age groups . " klaus gehrke -lrb- sms / dpa / ap -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with 91.6 percent of votes counted , president hamid karzai has an absolute majority of 54.1 percent . this is the first time that the figures show that president hamid karzai has enough votes to win in a single round and avoid a runoff poll .
figures released by afghanistan 's independent electoral commission -lrb- iec -rrb- give karzai a commanding lead with 54.1 percent , with 91.6 percent of all votes counted so far .
karzai 's nearest rival , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , is well behind with 28.3 percent .
nearly 5.5 million valid votes have been counted so far , the iec said .
karzai has 2,959,093 votes against abdullah 's 1,546,490 , the electoral commission announced at a news conference on tuesday .
the electoral commission announced on sunday that it had discarded around 200,000 ballots from 447 polling sites nationally where it had found vote fraud .
partial recount ordered on tuesday , the un-backed independent election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- said it too had clear evidence of fraud in the election . the body said it received more than 2,000 complaints , about a third of which could impact the final result .
" in the course of its investigations , the election complaints commission has found clear and convincing evidence of fraud in a number of polling stations , " the ecc said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 08.09.2009 schools should improve teaching to reduce illiteracy , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy is n't a game people can afford to play , experts say illiteracy is n't only a problem in the developing world ; in germany , there are some 4 million people who are unable to read or write .
the country has to make sure students are literate , one expert told dw . as the world observes world literacy day , there are estimated to be 776 million people who are unable to read or write , according to the united nations .
that statistic led un secretary-general ban ki-moon to call for increased effort in the fight to end illiteracy . " in a world of enormous wealth and in a world where education and knowledge are the keys to a better life , the extent of global illiteracy is shocking , " he said .
" education gives people the tools they need to improve their living situation and take part in public decision making . " while the days of marking official documents with an " x " are long past for the vast majority of germans , not being able to read or write remains a problem that is growing more acute as jobs requiring few skills dry up , according to peter hubertus , the head of germany 's federal literacy association . " there are still people with limited reading and writing skills , and for a long time that has not been a large problem - even for the people who could not read or write at all , " he told deutsche welle .
" but the shift toward a knowledge-based society makes greater educational demands .
it 's clear that a person in germany in 2009 ca n't get by reading and writing at a first or second-grade level . " most functional illiterates attended school bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some students can write only at the most basic of levels hubertus estimated that there are 4 million illiterate people in germany with the reading and writing skills of a primary school student .
the majority of these people attended german schools , which he said posed a major problem for germany as students leave school frustrated and without sufficient basic skills . while numerous courses exist to teach young people how to read and write , it 's difficult to convince many of them how important these skills are . " there are a lot of courses , but we 're unable to reach many young adults , " hubertus said .
" young people tend to be so happy to be finished with school and no longer have to deal with writing .
when they leave school it 's hard to get them involved in a new learning process . " motivating kids to learn but in order for germany to maintain its position as an economic power , schools have to try to keep students from leaving without being able to read or write , according to michael huether , the director of a german economic research institute in cologne . the key to reaching young people is to disguise the learning process with issues they are already involved in , hubertus said , adding that fashion and music have proven to be areas where many illiterate or functionally illiterate teenagers want to make their opinions known . ideally , schools would identify learning deficiencies before kids reach their teens , hubertus said . " we have to strengthen kindergartens , provide better training for teachers and improve primary schools , " he said .
" there needs to be more individualized learning so students are supported step by step .
all this has to happen with topics that are interesting for each of the various age groups . " klaus gehrke -lrb- sms / dpa / ap -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" every innocent person who is killed in afghanistan is one too many , " merkel told parliamentarians in berlin .
while promising a thorough investigation and a full report on the raid , which is believed to have left dozens of taliban militants as well as civilians dead , merkel slammed critics for drawing premature conclusions .
" i will ensure that we will not put a gloss on anything .
i will also ensure that we will not accept any premature judgments .
and having experienced what i have in recent days , i say very clearly : i will not take this from anyone , either here in germany or from abroad , " she said .
on saturday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner had called the airstrike a " big mistake . "
afghan president hamid karzai had told french daily le figaro in an interview published on monday that the attack was an " error of judgment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike targeted two fuel trucks that were hijacked by taliban militants " militarily necessary and correct " the german defense ministry on monday described the airstrike as " militarily necessary and correct " because it prevented the taliban from using the two hijacked fuel trucks as mobile bombs .
germany defense minister franz josef jung of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- has faced criticism over his information policy as well as calls for him to step down .
his ministry had initially said that the airstrike had only killed taliban militants .
however , on monday jung was forced to acknowledge that he could no longer rule out any civilian casualties , and on tuesday the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan indicated for the first time that civilians were probably killed in the attack , however , without providing any exact casualty figures .
" believing civilians were not in the area , the local isaf commander authorized an airstrike , which destroyed the two fuel trucks , " isaf said in a statement .
" subsequent review has led isaf to believe that along with insurgents , civilians also were killed and injured in the strike . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defence minister jung says the airstrike was necessary not an election campaign with all but one german political party supporting the government 's stance on the afghanistan mission , parliamentarians were quick to affirm on tuesday that the tragic incident would not be exploited as a campaign issue ahead of the sept .
27 national election .
the only party in the bundestag calling for the immediate withdrawal of germany 's 4,200 troops is the left party .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " oskar lafontaine , the co-leader of the opposition left told parliament on tuesday .
however , the left party and its leaders have a reputation in germany for demanding what is currently popular rather than politically expedient .
even before the airstrike controversy , a poll in july showed that up to 69 percent of germans wanted their soldiers to pull out of afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine , co-leader of the left party , wants germany out of afghanistan government remains committed despite the german public 's reservations over the afghanistan mission , the chancellor has refrained from giving any pullout date for german forces , and she also sidestepped the issue during her speech on tuesday .
instead , merkel drew attention to what had brought international forces to the war-torn country in the first place .
" it was afghanistan , controlled by the taliban and al qaeda , that was the breeding ground for the terror of september 11 , " merkel said .
" the september 11 attacks were followed by dreadful attacks in europe - in madrid and in london .
we know too that germany is in their sights ...
the engagement in afghanistan is our reaction to terror .
that 's where it came from , not the other way around . "
merkel also referred to a joint german-british-franco proposal for an international conference this year to pressure the afghan government to take on more responsibilities , enabling the withdrawal of coalition forces .
" for germany , britain and france , this conference is about creating the conditions for developing an internationally agreed handover strategy , " merkel said on tuesday .
" our overriding political goal is and remains an afghanistan that can handle its own security . "
it was unclear where and when the conference would be held , but the united nations , which is to host the event , has proposed kabul as the venue. nk / reuters / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

" every innocent person who is killed in afghanistan is one too many , " merkel told parliamentarians in berlin .
while promising a thorough investigation and a full report on the raid , which is believed to have left dozens of taliban militants as well as civilians dead , merkel slammed critics for drawing premature conclusions .
" i will ensure that we will not put a gloss on anything .
i will also ensure that we will not accept any premature judgments .
and having experienced what i have in recent days , i say very clearly : i will not take this from anyone , either here in germany or from abroad , " she said .
on saturday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner had called the airstrike a " big mistake . "
afghan president hamid karzai had told french daily le figaro in an interview published on monday that the attack was an " error of judgment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike targeted two fuel trucks that were hijacked by taliban militants " militarily necessary and correct " the german defense ministry on monday described the airstrike as " militarily necessary and correct " because it prevented the taliban from using the two hijacked fuel trucks as mobile bombs .
germany defense minister franz josef jung of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- has faced criticism over his information policy as well as calls for him to step down .
his ministry had initially said that the airstrike had only killed taliban militants .
however , on monday jung was forced to acknowledge that he could no longer rule out any civilian casualties , and on tuesday the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan indicated for the first time that civilians were probably killed in the attack , however , without providing any exact casualty figures .
" believing civilians were not in the area , the local isaf commander authorized an airstrike , which destroyed the two fuel trucks , " isaf said in a statement .
" subsequent review has led isaf to believe that along with insurgents , civilians also were killed and injured in the strike . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defence minister jung says the airstrike was necessary not an election campaign with all but one german political party supporting the government 's stance on the afghanistan mission , parliamentarians were quick to affirm on tuesday that the tragic incident would not be exploited as a campaign issue ahead of the sept .
27 national election .
the only party in the bundestag calling for the immediate withdrawal of germany 's 4,200 troops is the left party .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " oskar lafontaine , the co-leader of the opposition left told parliament on tuesday .
however , the left party and its leaders have a reputation in germany for demanding what is currently popular rather than politically expedient .
even before the airstrike controversy , a poll in july showed that up to 69 percent of germans wanted their soldiers to pull out of afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine , co-leader of the left party , wants germany out of afghanistan government remains committed despite the german public 's reservations over the afghanistan mission , the chancellor has refrained from giving any pullout date for german forces , and she also sidestepped the issue during her speech on tuesday .
instead , merkel drew attention to what had brought international forces to the war-torn country in the first place .
" it was afghanistan , controlled by the taliban and al qaeda , that was the breeding ground for the terror of september 11 , " merkel said .
" the september 11 attacks were followed by dreadful attacks in europe - in madrid and in london .
we know too that germany is in their sights ...
the engagement in afghanistan is our reaction to terror .
that 's where it came from , not the other way around . "
merkel also referred to a joint german-british-franco proposal for an international conference this year to pressure the afghan government to take on more responsibilities , enabling the withdrawal of coalition forces .
" for germany , britain and france , this conference is about creating the conditions for developing an internationally agreed handover strategy , " merkel said on tuesday .
" our overriding political goal is and remains an afghanistan that can handle its own security . "
it was unclear where and when the conference would be held , but the united nations , which is to host the event , has proposed kabul as the venue. nk / reuters / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the accord is designed to streamline operations for the further integration of the european union . the vote was necessary after the country 's highest court in june ruled that an existing german law intended to allow lawmakers to ratify the treaty had to be amended to give parliament more decision-making powers in brussels .
the lisbon treaty must be ratified by all 27 member states of the european union before it can take effect .
aside from germany , the ratification process must still be completed in ireland , the czech republic and poland .
the legislation , passed on tuesday , now goes to the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , where representatives of germany 's 16 states are scheduled to vote on it on sept .
18 .
if it passes there , as expected , the law then goes to president horst koehler , whose signature would make germany 's ratification of the lisbon treaty official. gb / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plans by us lawmakers could trigger a trans-atlantic tit-for-tat response with travelers on both sides footing the bill . the european union has raised objections over us plans to introduce a $ 10 charge for travelers entering the us .
if the planned levy is deemed equivalent to a visa , eu lawmakers might decide to retaliate , by forcing entry-visas on us visitors to the 27-member bloc .
currently , 29 european countries are part of the us visa waiver program -lrb- among 35 countries worldwide -rrb- , permitting european tourists to enter the united states without a visa .
however , the us introduced an online registration process earlier this year , requiring european visitors to confirm their visa-free status , three days before their departure - a move that irritated eu officials in brussels at the time .
the european commission signaled that if the us changed the requirements of its electronic system for travel authorization -lrb- esta -rrb- , the eu might be forced to review its own position .
" the introduction of a fee by the us , would require a new assessment of the european commission ... to evaluate whether the esta system , is tantamount to a visa or not , " said commission spokesman michele cercone .
scanning for terrorists eu officials believe a fee would also discourage european visitors from registering online , which - as cercone argued - would undermine the security objectives of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe may retaliate if the us introduces its $ 10 levy " the introduction of such a fee would constitute a step backward in our joint endeavor to ease transatlantic mobility , " cercone said .
that argument resonates with european civil liberties groups , which see the electronic registration process - with or without a fee - as an invasion of privacy rights .
they say the us has no right to the personal information of eu citizens .
the us argues that information is crucial in the fight against terrorism .
washington says the system gives us intelligence officials a 72 hours ' heads-up ' if unwanted visitors -lrb- or would-be terrorists -rrb- are planning to travel to the us .
officials in brussels are reluctant to comment further , stressing the plan to introduce a $ 10 charge is still being debated in washington .
but other eu representatives have been less cautious .
" only in ' alice in wonderland ' could a penalty be seen as promoting the activity on which it is imposed , " the european commission 's ambassador to the united states , john bruton , said . other eu objections , especially in countries where credit cards are less widely used , include the question of how any levy would be paid .
there is a growing sense in brussels , that forcing europeans to pay $ 10 to enter the united states by credit card and online only discriminates against those visitors who neither use the internet nor possess a credit card .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility the $ 10 registration fee , which would last two years before having to be renewed , has been described by us lawmakers as ' nominal . '
they say the money generated by the registration fee , would go towards teaching visitors how to use the electronic registration process as well as other programs to promote travel to the us .
the weakest link another source of tension between the eu and us over the visa waiver program , involves the way the deal is negotiated .
eu officials argue washington should stop negotiating with individual eu countries bilaterally , and instead , work with the european union has a whole .
but washington insiders accuse the eu of hypocrisy , arguing that if eu unity is so important to the europeans , then individual countries benefiting from the visa waiver program should be prepared to give it up in solidarity with those eu member states that continue to be excluded .
us administration officials also insist there are live security threats in europe .
washington clearly views greece as problematic .
it is the only ' old ' eu member state which has been denied the visa waiver program .
us intelligence does not trust greek passport security and is unconvinced by athens ' commitment to fighting terrorism and extremists .
but brussels argues , no eu member state should be left in limbo - and negotiating with one eu country , should mean , negotiating with all .

" every innocent person who is killed in afghanistan is one too many , " merkel told parliamentarians in berlin .
while promising a thorough investigation and a full report on the raid , which is believed to have left dozens of taliban militants as well as civilians dead , merkel slammed critics for drawing premature conclusions .
" i will ensure that we will not put a gloss on anything .
i will also ensure that we will not accept any premature judgments .
and having experienced what i have in recent days , i say very clearly : i will not take this from anyone , either here in germany or from abroad , " she said .
on saturday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner had called the airstrike a " big mistake . "
afghan president hamid karzai had told french daily le figaro in an interview published on monday that the attack was an " error of judgment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike targeted two fuel trucks that were hijacked by taliban militants " militarily necessary and correct " the german defense ministry on monday described the airstrike as " militarily necessary and correct " because it prevented the taliban from using the two hijacked fuel trucks as mobile bombs .
germany defense minister franz josef jung of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- has faced criticism over his information policy as well as calls for him to step down .
his ministry had initially said that the airstrike had only killed taliban militants .
however , on monday jung was forced to acknowledge that he could no longer rule out any civilian casualties , and on tuesday the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan indicated for the first time that civilians were probably killed in the attack , however , without providing any exact casualty figures .
" believing civilians were not in the area , the local isaf commander authorized an airstrike , which destroyed the two fuel trucks , " isaf said in a statement .
" subsequent review has led isaf to believe that along with insurgents , civilians also were killed and injured in the strike . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defence minister jung says the airstrike was necessary not an election campaign with all but one german political party supporting the government 's stance on the afghanistan mission , parliamentarians were quick to affirm on tuesday that the tragic incident would not be exploited as a campaign issue ahead of the sept .
27 national election .
the only party in the bundestag calling for the immediate withdrawal of germany 's 4,200 troops is the left party .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " oskar lafontaine , the co-leader of the opposition left told parliament on tuesday .
however , the left party and its leaders have a reputation in germany for demanding what is currently popular rather than politically expedient .
even before the airstrike controversy , a poll in july showed that up to 69 percent of germans wanted their soldiers to pull out of afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine , co-leader of the left party , wants germany out of afghanistan government remains committed despite the german public 's reservations over the afghanistan mission , the chancellor has refrained from giving any pullout date for german forces , and she also sidestepped the issue during her speech on tuesday .
instead , merkel drew attention to what had brought international forces to the war-torn country in the first place .
" it was afghanistan , controlled by the taliban and al qaeda , that was the breeding ground for the terror of september 11 , " merkel said .
" the september 11 attacks were followed by dreadful attacks in europe - in madrid and in london .
we know too that germany is in their sights ...
the engagement in afghanistan is our reaction to terror .
that 's where it came from , not the other way around . "
merkel also referred to a joint german-british-franco proposal for an international conference this year to pressure the afghan government to take on more responsibilities , enabling the withdrawal of coalition forces .
" for germany , britain and france , this conference is about creating the conditions for developing an internationally agreed handover strategy , " merkel said on tuesday .
" our overriding political goal is and remains an afghanistan that can handle its own security . "
it was unclear where and when the conference would be held , but the united nations , which is to host the event , has proposed kabul as the venue. nk / reuters / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with 91.6 percent of votes counted , president hamid karzai has an absolute majority of 54.1 percent . this is the first time that the figures show that president hamid karzai has enough votes to win in a single round and avoid a runoff poll .
figures released by afghanistan 's independent electoral commission -lrb- iec -rrb- give karzai a commanding lead with 54.1 percent , with 91.6 percent of all votes counted so far .
karzai 's nearest rival , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , is well behind with 28.3 percent .
nearly 5.5 million valid votes have been counted so far , the iec said .
karzai has 2,959,093 votes against abdullah 's 1,546,490 , the electoral commission announced at a news conference on tuesday .
the electoral commission announced on sunday that it had discarded around 200,000 ballots from 447 polling sites nationally where it had found vote fraud .
partial recount ordered on tuesday , the un-backed independent election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- said it too had clear evidence of fraud in the election . the body said it received more than 2,000 complaints , about a third of which could impact the final result .
" in the course of its investigations , the election complaints commission has found clear and convincing evidence of fraud in a number of polling stations , " the ecc said in a statement .
it did not say which candidate gained from the fraud , or where the suspicious ballots had been cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans voted amid taliban threats of violence the ecc has ordered the electoral commission to review votes from 600 more polling stations .
these include stations where a single candidate received more than 95 percent of the votes and those where more than 600 votes were cast , the most that could be cast a single station .
polling stations with suspiciously high voter participation , given a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , are also to be reviewed .
the low turnout , accredited to taliban voter intimidation and violence , is also threatening to cast doubt on the credibility of the process and the legitimacy of the winner .
preliminary results from 100 percent of votes cast across the country are expected to be announced on thursday .
karzai must have 50 percent of all ballots cast , plus one extra ballot , to be declared the winner .
final official results are not due before sept .

with 91.6 percent of votes counted , president hamid karzai has an absolute majority of 54.1 percent . this is the first time that the figures show that president hamid karzai has enough votes to win in a single round and avoid a runoff poll .
figures released by afghanistan 's independent electoral commission -lrb- iec -rrb- give karzai a commanding lead with 54.1 percent , with 91.6 percent of all votes counted so far .
karzai 's nearest rival , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , is well behind with 28.3 percent .
nearly 5.5 million valid votes have been counted so far , the iec said .
karzai has 2,959,093 votes against abdullah 's 1,546,490 , the electoral commission announced at a news conference on tuesday .
the electoral commission announced on sunday that it had discarded around 200,000 ballots from 447 polling sites nationally where it had found vote fraud .
partial recount ordered on tuesday , the un-backed independent election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- said it too had clear evidence of fraud in the election . the body said it received more than 2,000 complaints , about a third of which could impact the final result .
" in the course of its investigations , the election complaints commission has found clear and convincing evidence of fraud in a number of polling stations , " the ecc said in a statement .
it did not say which candidate gained from the fraud , or where the suspicious ballots had been cast .

these include stations where a single candidate received more than 95 percent of the votes and those where more than 600 votes were cast , the most that could be cast a single station .
polling stations with suspiciously high voter participation , given a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , are also to be reviewed .
the low turnout , accredited to taliban voter intimidation and violence , is also threatening to cast doubt on the credibility of the process and the legitimacy of the winner .
preliminary results from 100 percent of votes cast across the country are expected to be announced on thursday .
karzai must have 50 percent of all ballots cast , plus one extra ballot , to be declared the winner .
final official results are not due before sept .

" every innocent person who is killed in afghanistan is one too many , " merkel told parliamentarians in berlin .
while promising a thorough investigation and a full report on the raid , which is believed to have left dozens of taliban militants as well as civilians dead , merkel slammed critics for drawing premature conclusions .
" i will ensure that we will not put a gloss on anything .
i will also ensure that we will not accept any premature judgments .
and having experienced what i have in recent days , i say very clearly : i will not take this from anyone , either here in germany or from abroad , " she said .
on saturday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner had called the airstrike a " big mistake . "
afghan president hamid karzai had told french daily le figaro in an interview published on monday that the attack was an " error of judgment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike targeted two fuel trucks that were hijacked by taliban militants " militarily necessary and correct " the german defense ministry on monday described the airstrike as " militarily necessary and correct " because it prevented the taliban from using the two hijacked fuel trucks as mobile bombs .
germany defense minister franz josef jung of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- has faced criticism over his information policy as well as calls for him to step down .
his ministry had initially said that the airstrike had only killed taliban militants .
however , on monday jung was forced to acknowledge that he could no longer rule out any civilian casualties , and on tuesday the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan indicated for the first time that civilians were probably killed in the attack , however , without providing any exact casualty figures .
" believing civilians were not in the area , the local isaf commander authorized an airstrike , which destroyed the two fuel trucks , " isaf said in a statement .
" subsequent review has led isaf to believe that along with insurgents , civilians also were killed and injured in the strike . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defence minister jung says the airstrike was necessary not an election campaign with all but one german political party supporting the government 's stance on the afghanistan mission , parliamentarians were quick to affirm on tuesday that the tragic incident would not be exploited as a campaign issue ahead of the sept .

the only party in the bundestag calling for the immediate withdrawal of germany 's 4,200 troops is the left party .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " oskar lafontaine , the co-leader of the opposition left told parliament on tuesday .
however , the left party and its leaders have a reputation in germany for demanding what is currently popular rather than politically expedient .
even before the airstrike controversy , a poll in july showed that up to 69 percent of germans wanted their soldiers to pull out of afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine , co-leader of the left party , wants germany out of afghanistan government remains committed despite the german public 's reservations over the afghanistan mission , the chancellor has refrained from giving any pullout date for german forces , and she also sidestepped the issue during her speech on tuesday .
instead , merkel drew attention to what had brought international forces to the war-torn country in the first place .
" it was afghanistan , controlled by the taliban and al qaeda , that was the breeding ground for the terror of september 11 , " merkel said .
" the september 11 attacks were followed by dreadful attacks in europe - in madrid and in london .
we know too that germany is in their sights ...
the engagement in afghanistan is our reaction to terror .
that 's where it came from , not the other way around . "
merkel also referred to a joint german-british-franco proposal for an international conference this year to pressure the afghan government to take on more responsibilities , enabling the withdrawal of coalition forces .
" for germany , britain and france , this conference is about creating the conditions for developing an internationally agreed handover strategy , " merkel said on tuesday .
" our overriding political goal is and remains an afghanistan that can handle its own security . "
it was unclear where and when the conference would be held , but the united nations , which is to host the event , has proposed kabul as the venue. nk / reuters / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the lisbon treaty must be ratified by all 27 member states of the european union before it can take effect .
aside from germany , the ratification process must still be completed in ireland , the czech republic and poland .
the legislation , passed on tuesday , now goes to the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , where representatives of germany 's 16 states are scheduled to vote on it on sept .
18 .
if it passes there , as expected , the law then goes to president horst koehler , whose signature would make germany 's ratification of the lisbon treaty official. gb / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" every innocent person who is killed in afghanistan is one too many , " merkel told parliamentarians in berlin .
while promising a thorough investigation and a full report on the raid , which is believed to have left dozens of taliban militants as well as civilians dead , merkel slammed critics for drawing premature conclusions .
" i will ensure that we will not put a gloss on anything .
i will also ensure that we will not accept any premature judgments .
and having experienced what i have in recent days , i say very clearly : i will not take this from anyone , either here in germany or from abroad , " she said .
on saturday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner had called the airstrike a " big mistake . "
afghan president hamid karzai had told french daily le figaro in an interview published on monday that the attack was an " error of judgment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike targeted two fuel trucks that were hijacked by taliban militants " militarily necessary and correct " the german defense ministry on monday described the airstrike as " militarily necessary and correct " because it prevented the taliban from using the two hijacked fuel trucks as mobile bombs .
germany defense minister franz josef jung of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- has faced criticism over his information policy as well as calls for him to step down .
his ministry had initially said that the airstrike had only killed taliban militants .
however , on monday jung was forced to acknowledge that he could no longer rule out any civilian casualties , and on tuesday the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan indicated for the first time that civilians were probably killed in the attack , however , without providing any exact casualty figures .
" believing civilians were not in the area , the local isaf commander authorized an airstrike , which destroyed the two fuel trucks , " isaf said in a statement .
" subsequent review has led isaf to believe that along with insurgents , civilians also were killed and injured in the strike . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defence minister jung says the airstrike was necessary not an election campaign with all but one german political party supporting the government 's stance on the afghanistan mission , parliamentarians were quick to affirm on tuesday that the tragic incident would not be exploited as a campaign issue ahead of the sept .
27 national election .
the only party in the bundestag calling for the immediate withdrawal of germany 's 4,200 troops is the left party .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " oskar lafontaine , the co-leader of the opposition left told parliament on tuesday .
however , the left party and its leaders have a reputation in germany for demanding what is currently popular rather than politically expedient .
even before the airstrike controversy , a poll in july showed that up to 69 percent of germans wanted their soldiers to pull out of afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine , co-leader of the left party , wants germany out of afghanistan government remains committed despite the german public 's reservations over the afghanistan mission , the chancellor has refrained from giving any pullout date for german forces , and she also sidestepped the issue during her speech on tuesday .
instead , merkel drew attention to what had brought international forces to the war-torn country in the first place .
" it was afghanistan , controlled by the taliban and al qaeda , that was the breeding ground for the terror of september 11 , " merkel said .
" the september 11 attacks were followed by dreadful attacks in europe - in madrid and in london .
we know too that germany is in their sights ...
the engagement in afghanistan is our reaction to terror .
that 's where it came from , not the other way around . "
merkel also referred to a joint german-british-franco proposal for an international conference this year to pressure the afghan government to take on more responsibilities , enabling the withdrawal of coalition forces .
" for germany , britain and france , this conference is about creating the conditions for developing an internationally agreed handover strategy , " merkel said on tuesday .
" our overriding political goal is and remains an afghanistan that can handle its own security . "
it was unclear where and when the conference would be held , but the united nations , which is to host the event , has proposed kabul as the venue. nk / reuters / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the course of its investigations , the election complaints commission has found clear and convincing evidence of fraud in a number of polling stations , " the ecc said in a statement .
it did not say which candidate gained from the fraud , or where the suspicious ballots had been cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans voted amid taliban threats of violence the ecc has ordered the electoral commission to review votes from 600 more polling stations .
these include stations where a single candidate received more than 95 percent of the votes and those where more than 600 votes were cast , the most that could be cast a single station .
polling stations with suspiciously high voter participation , given a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , are also to be reviewed .
the low turnout , accredited to taliban voter intimidation and violence , is also threatening to cast doubt on the credibility of the process and the legitimacy of the winner .
preliminary results from 100 percent of votes cast across the country are expected to be announced on thursday .
karzai must have 50 percent of all ballots cast , plus one extra ballot , to be declared the winner .
final official results are not due before sept .

the plans by us lawmakers could trigger a trans-atlantic tit-for-tat response with travelers on both sides footing the bill . the european union has raised objections over us plans to introduce a $ 10 charge for travelers entering the us .
if the planned levy is deemed equivalent to a visa , eu lawmakers might decide to retaliate , by forcing entry-visas on us visitors to the 27-member bloc .
currently , 29 european countries are part of the us visa waiver program -lrb- among 35 countries worldwide -rrb- , permitting european tourists to enter the united states without a visa .
however , the us introduced an online registration process earlier this year , requiring european visitors to confirm their visa-free status , three days before their departure - a move that irritated eu officials in brussels at the time .
the european commission signaled that if the us changed the requirements of its electronic system for travel authorization -lrb- esta -rrb- , the eu might be forced to review its own position .
" the introduction of a fee by the us , would require a new assessment of the european commission ... to evaluate whether the esta system , is tantamount to a visa or not , " said commission spokesman michele cercone .
scanning for terrorists eu officials believe a fee would also discourage european visitors from registering online , which - as cercone argued - would undermine the security objectives of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe may retaliate if the us introduces its $ 10 levy " the introduction of such a fee would constitute a step backward in our joint endeavor to ease transatlantic mobility , " cercone said .
that argument resonates with european civil liberties groups , which see the electronic registration process - with or without a fee - as an invasion of privacy rights .
they say the us has no right to the personal information of eu citizens .
the us argues that information is crucial in the fight against terrorism .
washington says the system gives us intelligence officials a 72 hours ' heads-up ' if unwanted visitors -lrb- or would-be terrorists -rrb- are planning to travel to the us .
officials in brussels are reluctant to comment further , stressing the plan to introduce a $ 10 charge is still being debated in washington .
but other eu representatives have been less cautious .
" only in ' alice in wonderland ' could a penalty be seen as promoting the activity on which it is imposed , " the european commission 's ambassador to the united states , john bruton , said . other eu objections , especially in countries where credit cards are less widely used , include the question of how any levy would be paid .
there is a growing sense in brussels , that forcing europeans to pay $ 10 to enter the united states by credit card and online only discriminates against those visitors who neither use the internet nor possess a credit card .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility the $ 10 registration fee , which would last two years before having to be renewed , has been described by us lawmakers as ' nominal . '
they say the money generated by the registration fee , would go towards teaching visitors how to use the electronic registration process as well as other programs to promote travel to the us .
the weakest link another source of tension between the eu and us over the visa waiver program , involves the way the deal is negotiated .
eu officials argue washington should stop negotiating with individual eu countries bilaterally , and instead , work with the european union has a whole .
but washington insiders accuse the eu of hypocrisy , arguing that if eu unity is so important to the europeans , then individual countries benefiting from the visa waiver program should be prepared to give it up in solidarity with those eu member states that continue to be excluded .
us administration officials also insist there are live security threats in europe .
washington clearly views greece as problematic .
it is the only ' old ' eu member state which has been denied the visa waiver program .
us intelligence does not trust greek passport security and is unconvinced by athens ' commitment to fighting terrorism and extremists .

the plans by us lawmakers could trigger a trans-atlantic tit-for-tat response with travelers on both sides footing the bill . the european union has raised objections over us plans to introduce a $ 10 charge for travelers entering the us .
if the planned levy is deemed equivalent to a visa , eu lawmakers might decide to retaliate , by forcing entry-visas on us visitors to the 27-member bloc .
currently , 29 european countries are part of the us visa waiver program -lrb- among 35 countries worldwide -rrb- , permitting european tourists to enter the united states without a visa .
however , the us introduced an online registration process earlier this year , requiring european visitors to confirm their visa-free status , three days before their departure - a move that irritated eu officials in brussels at the time .
the european commission signaled that if the us changed the requirements of its electronic system for travel authorization -lrb- esta -rrb- , the eu might be forced to review its own position .
" the introduction of a fee by the us , would require a new assessment of the european commission ... to evaluate whether the esta system , is tantamount to a visa or not , " said commission spokesman michele cercone .
scanning for terrorists eu officials believe a fee would also discourage european visitors from registering online , which - as cercone argued - would undermine the security objectives of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe may retaliate if the us introduces its $ 10 levy " the introduction of such a fee would constitute a step backward in our joint endeavor to ease transatlantic mobility , " cercone said .
that argument resonates with european civil liberties groups , which see the electronic registration process - with or without a fee - as an invasion of privacy rights .
they say the us has no right to the personal information of eu citizens .
the us argues that information is crucial in the fight against terrorism .
washington says the system gives us intelligence officials a 72 hours ' heads-up ' if unwanted visitors -lrb- or would-be terrorists -rrb- are planning to travel to the us .
officials in brussels are reluctant to comment further , stressing the plan to introduce a $ 10 charge is still being debated in washington .
but other eu representatives have been less cautious .
" only in ' alice in wonderland ' could a penalty be seen as promoting the activity on which it is imposed , " the european commission 's ambassador to the united states , john bruton , said . other eu objections , especially in countries where credit cards are less widely used , include the question of how any levy would be paid .
there is a growing sense in brussels , that forcing europeans to pay $ 10 to enter the united states by credit card and online only discriminates against those visitors who neither use the internet nor possess a credit card .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility the $ 10 registration fee , which would last two years before having to be renewed , has been described by us lawmakers as ' nominal . '
they say the money generated by the registration fee , would go towards teaching visitors how to use the electronic registration process as well as other programs to promote travel to the us .
the weakest link another source of tension between the eu and us over the visa waiver program , involves the way the deal is negotiated .
eu officials argue washington should stop negotiating with individual eu countries bilaterally , and instead , work with the european union has a whole .
but washington insiders accuse the eu of hypocrisy , arguing that if eu unity is so important to the europeans , then individual countries benefiting from the visa waiver program should be prepared to give it up in solidarity with those eu member states that continue to be excluded .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 08.09.2009 corrupt political elites block development in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa 's corrupt political elites are leaving their people to suffer african leaders are responsible for the problems in their countries , and not former colonial powers .
development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "
his advice is that , " we should support independent african solutions only . "
exception to the rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benin 's president , thomas yayi boni , has tried to crack down on corruption that is exactly what hubi and vinciane , a small belgian aid organisation , does in the republic of benin .
talking to deutsche welle chairman piet van assche confirms that their approach is different : " in almost 30 years in benin we never took any initiative of our own .
we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .
but the author distinguishes between rich and poor .
" i do n't condemn the policeman , who collects a bribe on the side of the road .
i do n't condemn the poor , who are often desperate to survive .
i condemn the political elites , who do n't give a damn about the people . "
paul banoba from transparency international in berlin , which studies and fights corruption worldwide , disagrees .
" you can not just blame the top , " he says in an interview with deutsche welle .
" in comparing corrupt policemen with corrupt politicians volker seitz may want to make a distinction between petty corruption and large-scale corruption .
but we define corruption as an evil in itself , at whatever level it occurs .
there is corruption at every level , it is widespread . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money makes the world go round especially for africa 's political elites it 's not easy to talk about corruption .
doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , which is represented in nearly all african countries , turned down deutsche welle 's interview request , arguing that , " msf is not involved in corruption , never deals with officials who expect a personal benefit and therefore hardly can answer the questions .
msf is neutral and does not officially blame others without being involved itself . "
piet van assche from hubi and vinciane says his company has managed to stay clear of any allegations of corruption : " to my knowledge we 've never had anything to do with corruption . "
democracy and its many faces van assche says that the transition of power in benin has gone smoothly since he started working there in the mid-eighties .
but volker seitz warns that european democracy does n't always fit into an african environment : " it 's difficult to transfer our western parliamentarian system to africa .
what counts is the political will to improve the standard of living .
education is important .
human rights must be respected .
those things , i believe , are not negotiable , but it does n't have to be parliamentarian democracy as we know it . "

seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "
his advice is that , " we should support independent african solutions only . "

talking to deutsche welle chairman piet van assche confirms that their approach is different : " in almost 30 years in benin we never took any initiative of our own .
we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .
but the author distinguishes between rich and poor .
" i do n't condemn the policeman , who collects a bribe on the side of the road .
i do n't condemn the poor , who are often desperate to survive .
i condemn the political elites , who do n't give a damn about the people . "
paul banoba from transparency international in berlin , which studies and fights corruption worldwide , disagrees .
" you can not just blame the top , " he says in an interview with deutsche welle .
" in comparing corrupt policemen with corrupt politicians volker seitz may want to make a distinction between petty corruption and large-scale corruption .
but we define corruption as an evil in itself , at whatever level it occurs .
there is corruption at every level , it is widespread . "

doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , which is represented in nearly all african countries , turned down deutsche welle 's interview request , arguing that , " msf is not involved in corruption , never deals with officials who expect a personal benefit and therefore hardly can answer the questions .

what counts is the political will to improve the standard of living .
education is important .
human rights must be respected .
those things , i believe , are not negotiable , but it does n't have to be parliamentarian democracy as we know it . "

he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .

he told deutsche welle why he did it and what he hopes will come of it . christian democrat juergen ruettgers has said in several speeches during the recent local election campaign in north rhine-westphalia that romanian workers were not punctual , did what they liked and did n't know what they were doing .
his remarks were made against a controversial background : many workers had lost their jobs when a factory in the state had been moved to romania . vlad georgescu has said that chancellor merkel , who is also chairman of the christian democrats , should sack ruettgers as her deputy .
he has also called on german citizens with foreign origins to boycott the christian democrats in the forthcoming general election . dw : mr. georgescu , is n't this just campaign rhetoric ?
why are you taking it so seriously ?
vlad georgescu : we think that article 1 of the german constitution describes human dignity as the most valuable thing we have in germany and in our democracy .
this is not a matter of the electoral campaign , but rather is a question of why the premier of north rhine westphalia does n't know this article .
if he does n't know the articles , then i think he should resign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers : ' not someone with nothing to say ' to merkel well i 'm sure he does know the article .
do you really think he 's a racist ?
juergen ruettgers uses racist phrases to reach the far right voters , i suppose .
as a german citizen born in romania , i really would like to say that i do n't think we need such speeches .
what we really need are real visions to solve the problems of the country in the future – the economic problems , the ethical problems .
i do n't know if mr. ruettgers privately believes what he is talking about in public , but this is not an excuse .
what he said was recorded and there are a lot of people who could see the speech , and this is the reason why we think there is a need to boycott the christian democratic party , the cdu , as long as mr. ruettgers is premier in north rhine westphalia .
but he has apologized .
he has admitted that it was a mistake and he should n't have said it .
from a judicial point of view , i think this is a solution that does n't work .
in germany you ca n't just insult people and then say , " okay , folks , i 'm sorry about it . "
i think this is a politically strategic act by mr. ruettgers .
he knows that by saying that romanian , chinese and other foreigners are the people who take away the jobs in germany , he is able to really reach those people who are leaning towards voting for the npd or other far right parties .
after having said this , he is now trying to give the impression that he 's sorry about it , but he 's not sorry .
this is n't the first time he has used such phrases and i think it 's a strategy being used by the cdu in north rhine westphalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has also felt the crisis , georgescu says you 've actually called on chancellor merkel to sack him as one of the deputy leaders of the christian democrats .
what has she got to do with it ?
chancellor merkel is responsible for the top leaders in her party and mr. ruettgers is not someone who has nothing to say in the party .
he tries to give the impression that he 's fighting for workers ' rights .
he is someone who has a lot of power as premier and who has a lot of power within the cdu at the top levels .
so mrs. merkel needs to decide if she wants to keep such people and such racist phrases in her party or not .
i think that as long as chancellor merkel decides to stay with ruettgers , many people coming from the outside – migrants like me – will really have a right to boycott this party and say that as long as they hold such speeches then we will not vote for them .
but the fact is that foreigners do n't vote for the cdu anyway , do they ?
my parents did .
there are a lot of foreigners – i 'm speaking now about foreigners coming from romania – who have a socialist background .
there are many people coming from the former soviet union bloc who have this background .
many of them , the older people , are afraid of the politics of the left or the socialists .
so these people really did vote for the cdu , i think .
for example , i have spoken to my mother and she was very upset .
she told me i ca n't blame the whole party for what mr. ruettgers said .
and i explained to her that yes , that really is what i want to do because i can assure everyone that the romanian workers are working just as hard as the german workers .
there is , in fact , no difference .
we 're living in the european union and the times are hard here and they 're hard in romania .
i think the cdu underestimates the danger of such speeches .

development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "
his advice is that , " we should support independent african solutions only . "
exception to the rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benin 's president , thomas yayi boni , has tried to crack down on corruption that is exactly what hubi and vinciane , a small belgian aid organisation , does in the republic of benin .
talking to deutsche welle chairman piet van assche confirms that their approach is different : " in almost 30 years in benin we never took any initiative of our own .
we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .
but the author distinguishes between rich and poor .
" i do n't condemn the policeman , who collects a bribe on the side of the road .
i do n't condemn the poor , who are often desperate to survive .
i condemn the political elites , who do n't give a damn about the people . "
paul banoba from transparency international in berlin , which studies and fights corruption worldwide , disagrees .
" you can not just blame the top , " he says in an interview with deutsche welle .
" in comparing corrupt policemen with corrupt politicians volker seitz may want to make a distinction between petty corruption and large-scale corruption .
but we define corruption as an evil in itself , at whatever level it occurs .
there is corruption at every level , it is widespread . "

piet van assche from hubi and vinciane says his company has managed to stay clear of any allegations of corruption : " to my knowledge we 've never had anything to do with corruption . "
democracy and its many faces van assche says that the transition of power in benin has gone smoothly since he started working there in the mid-eighties .
but volker seitz warns that european democracy does n't always fit into an african environment : " it 's difficult to transfer our western parliamentarian system to africa .
what counts is the political will to improve the standard of living .
education is important .
human rights must be respected .
those things , i believe , are not negotiable , but it does n't have to be parliamentarian democracy as we know it . "

development aid often makes things worse .
that 's the message of a new book by former german ambassador volker seitz . " african politics , " volker seitz writes , " lead to poverty . "
the continent has a wealth of natural and human resources , but lacks responsible leaders .
" the political elites i 've met , " the author said in an interview with deutsche welle , " have europe or the united states on their mind , not their own population . "
seitz spent 17 years of his diplomatic career between 1965 and 2008 in africa , the last four years as german ambassador in cameroon .
he observed throughout the post-colonial era how things did not improve for common people in most african countries , and how simultaneously political elites became richer all the time .
the former diplomat says there is no link between former colonial times and today 's poverty in africa , where the masses still survive on less than one euro per day .
" you can not blame colonialism for the fact that tax money is abused today , " seitz argues .
well-meant development aid only contributes to the problems , he believes , because that way politicians have more money to keep for themselves : " let me call it an aid fiasco : we feel responsible for africa 's development , while actually the african elites should be responsible . "
his advice is that , " we should support independent african solutions only . "
exception to the rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benin 's president , thomas yayi boni , has tried to crack down on corruption that is exactly what hubi and vinciane , a small belgian aid organisation , does in the republic of benin .
talking to deutsche welle chairman piet van assche confirms that their approach is different : " in almost 30 years in benin we never took any initiative of our own .
we are busy enough with the requests we receive .
we listen first , find out what the people need , and then try to give it to them .
most other organisations are specialised .
they may offer drinking water for example , where there is plenty of it already . "
benin , volker seitz says , is in more aspects than one the positive exception to the rule : " the new president travels through the country , looks at the projects of his ministers and that can occasionally lead to the dismissal of a cabinet member . "
dr. thomas yayi boni became the president of benin in april 2006 .
" he focuses on education and that way offers the people perspectives , " says volker seitz .
" of course he 's got his problems with the old political elites .
his predecessor at least was not corrupt .
but he did n't do enough . "
corruption - the good and the bad corruption is a big issue in africa and in seitz 's book as well .
but the author distinguishes between rich and poor .
" i do n't condemn the policeman , who collects a bribe on the side of the road .
i do n't condemn the poor , who are often desperate to survive .
i condemn the political elites , who do n't give a damn about the people . "
paul banoba from transparency international in berlin , which studies and fights corruption worldwide , disagrees .
" you can not just blame the top , " he says in an interview with deutsche welle .
" in comparing corrupt policemen with corrupt politicians volker seitz may want to make a distinction between petty corruption and large-scale corruption .
but we define corruption as an evil in itself , at whatever level it occurs .
there is corruption at every level , it is widespread . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money makes the world go round especially for africa 's political elites it 's not easy to talk about corruption .
doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- , which is represented in nearly all african countries , turned down deutsche welle 's interview request , arguing that , " msf is not involved in corruption , never deals with officials who expect a personal benefit and therefore hardly can answer the questions .
msf is neutral and does not officially blame others without being involved itself . "
piet van assche from hubi and vinciane says his company has managed to stay clear of any allegations of corruption : " to my knowledge we 've never had anything to do with corruption . "
democracy and its many faces van assche says that the transition of power in benin has gone smoothly since he started working there in the mid-eighties .
but volker seitz warns that european democracy does n't always fit into an african environment : " it 's difficult to transfer our western parliamentarian system to africa .
what counts is the political will to improve the standard of living .
education is important .
human rights must be respected .
those things , i believe , are not negotiable , but it does n't have to be parliamentarian democracy as we know it . "

one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .
i do n't see that as a big problem .

one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .
i do n't see that as a big problem .

one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .
i do n't see that as a big problem .

with 91.6 percent of votes counted , president hamid karzai has an absolute majority of 54.1 percent . this is the first time that the figures show that president hamid karzai has enough votes to win in a single round and avoid a runoff poll .
figures released by afghanistan 's independent electoral commission -lrb- iec -rrb- give karzai a commanding lead with 54.1 percent , with 91.6 percent of all votes counted so far .
karzai 's nearest rival , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , is well behind with 28.3 percent .
nearly 5.5 million valid votes have been counted so far , the iec said .
karzai has 2,959,093 votes against abdullah 's 1,546,490 , the electoral commission announced at a news conference on tuesday .
the electoral commission announced on sunday that it had discarded around 200,000 ballots from 447 polling sites nationally where it had found vote fraud .
partial recount ordered on tuesday , the un-backed independent election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- said it too had clear evidence of fraud in the election . the body said it received more than 2,000 complaints , about a third of which could impact the final result .
" in the course of its investigations , the election complaints commission has found clear and convincing evidence of fraud in a number of polling stations , " the ecc said in a statement .
it did not say which candidate gained from the fraud , or where the suspicious ballots had been cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans voted amid taliban threats of violence the ecc has ordered the electoral commission to review votes from 600 more polling stations .
these include stations where a single candidate received more than 95 percent of the votes and those where more than 600 votes were cast , the most that could be cast a single station .
polling stations with suspiciously high voter participation , given a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , are also to be reviewed .
the low turnout , accredited to taliban voter intimidation and violence , is also threatening to cast doubt on the credibility of the process and the legitimacy of the winner .
preliminary results from 100 percent of votes cast across the country are expected to be announced on thursday .
karzai must have 50 percent of all ballots cast , plus one extra ballot , to be declared the winner .
final official results are not due before sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 08.09.2009 brazil to boost its military standing with strategic french partnership deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil hopes to profit from its strategic partnership with france french president nicolas sarkozy has signed a deal deepening military ties with brazil .
the strategic partnership between both countries was first launched last year and gives brazil more clout in latin america . the partnership covers the production of 50 helicopters , four conventional submarines and the development of the first brazilian nuclear submarine , even though the contract explicitly excludes the transfer of french nuclear know-how .
there are also investments planned in industrial and harbour facilities .
the project will cost the brazilian government around 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.4 billion -rrb- and will be financed by a consortium made up of six european banks .
the military cooperation includes the purchase of 36 french fighter planes , a deal that will give brazil one of the most advanced combat aircraft in latin america .
a valuable investment ?
however , german defence experts are sceptical about the military cooperation .
they believe the billion-euro treaty , which will boost brazil 's military capacity , could trigger an arms race on the continent , without bringing the advantages , which the brazilian government expects .
" right now it is hard to say whether this project will be successful indeed from a technological perspective and whether it will give brazil military advantages compared to other countries .
an ambitious project like this can also turn out to be a failure , " says ottfried nassauer , who is the head of the berlin information center for transatlantic security .
according to nassauer the cooperation with france should not cause any concern for the neighboring countries , as the understanding among the governments on the continent is good .
but he thinks that the money could be invested better elsewhere .
" the question which luiz inacio lula da silva 's government should ask is whether the investments are not too high and whether it is worth it , to spend such large amounts of money for its own political and military status .
there are many other social and economical fields , where the same kind of money most likely would create many more jobs and possibly lead to more transfer of technology .
military technology always costs more than civil technology , " says nassauer .
regional predominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bilateral deal could anger some of brazil 's regional neighbors political scientist daniel flemes , who is an expert for defence politics with the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg , fears that the cooperation with france can cause problems for the cooperation with latin american neighbors and lead to a regional arms race .
" the fact that brazil gains technological know-how out of partnerships outside of latin america , could trigger an arms race on the continent and hinder defence cooperation with the neighbouring countries , " flemes says .
he believes that brazil not only wants to secure its regional predominance with the contract , but is also striving to become a super power . " the country is trying to stabilise its regional predominance , not only on an economical and political , but on a military level as well .
simultaneously it wishes to expand its influence as an emerging country internationally , " flemes says .
but he also thinks brazil 's ambitions are a natural development , as some of its neighbors are expanding their military strength as well .
" some neighboring countries are modernising their military infrastructure .
venezuela spent four billion euros in the last four or five years on arms imports from russia .
also chile has increased its defence budget over the past years .
so brazil does n't stand alone with its military investments .
over the past five years time the total amount of defence expenditure in south america has more than doubled , " say flemes .

the integration of the two telecoms would create an entity with an estimated net value in excess of 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.74 billion -rrb- .
the firm would command a dominating 37 percent market share with around 28.4 million clients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orange aimes to build up its uk position in the venture any merger would first need approval by both groups ' supervisory boards and competition authorities .
a deal is expected to be signed by october .
deutsche telekom has been looking at improving the situation of its troubled british mobile unit for some time , but did not want to incur the costs of restructuring alone .
for france telecom , the deal is seen as a way its subsidiary can increase its market share without paying cash or taking on more debt .
deutsche telekom said tuesday in a statement the tie-up would give british clients " expanded network coverage and enhanced indoor and outdoor network quality for 2g and 3g services . "
orange uk chief executive officer tom alexander was to take on the same post at the new company , and be seconded by t-mobile uk ceo richard moat , it added. dfm / afp / reuters / ap editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumann 's death sentence became a prison sentence germany 's major political parties had first declined to support the current legislation because it was brought before parliament by the left party .
many of the party 's leading figures were once members of the communist party of former east germany .
the parties finally agreed to sponsor the bill when the left party removed itself from the list of backers .
arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .
but a justice ministry review headed by hans hugo klein , a former judge at the constitutional court , established that the nazis ' treason law was a merciless instrument of repression , and was so vague that it gave room to arbitrary rulings .
rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .
since then he has fought an uphill battle against prejudice and bureaucracy to see the records wiped clean .
he is the sole survivor of the group who initiated the association 20 years ago .
" i did n't want to be part of it any longer " baumann was an infantryman in occupied france when he deserted his regiment in 1942 .
he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .
his sentence was converted to 12 years imprisonment , and he was sent to the army prison in torgau , germany .
he survived , but when he returned to germany after the war , he found that the stigma of treason clung to him .
" i received many death threats .
we were treated like as cowards , scumbags and traitors .
no one was on our side . "
one group left to fight for it took years before opinion started to turn .
finally , in 1998 and 2002 , laws were passed that rehabilitated conscientious objectors , those found guilty of undermining the war effort , spies and deserters – among them baumann himself .
that left the small group of those charged with military treason - and baumann continued his battle on their behalf , despite the fact that his own honor had been restored .
according to baumann , 68 death sentences were handed down for wartime treason , and they were all executed but for one .
general walther von seydlitz-kurzbach survived because he was by that time a russian prisoner of war .
baumann is pleased that parliament is about to close one of the last chapter 's of nazi military arbitrariness .

the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumann 's death sentence became a prison sentence germany 's major political parties had first declined to support the current legislation because it was brought before parliament by the left party .
many of the party 's leading figures were once members of the communist party of former east germany .
the parties finally agreed to sponsor the bill when the left party removed itself from the list of backers .
arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .
but a justice ministry review headed by hans hugo klein , a former judge at the constitutional court , established that the nazis ' treason law was a merciless instrument of repression , and was so vague that it gave room to arbitrary rulings .
rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .
since then he has fought an uphill battle against prejudice and bureaucracy to see the records wiped clean .
he is the sole survivor of the group who initiated the association 20 years ago .
" i did n't want to be part of it any longer " baumann was an infantryman in occupied france when he deserted his regiment in 1942 .
he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .
his sentence was converted to 12 years imprisonment , and he was sent to the army prison in torgau , germany .
he survived , but when he returned to germany after the war , he found that the stigma of treason clung to him .
" i received many death threats .
we were treated like as cowards , scumbags and traitors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 08.09.2009 brazil to boost its military standing with strategic french partnership deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil hopes to profit from its strategic partnership with france french president nicolas sarkozy has signed a deal deepening military ties with brazil .
the strategic partnership between both countries was first launched last year and gives brazil more clout in latin america . the partnership covers the production of 50 helicopters , four conventional submarines and the development of the first brazilian nuclear submarine , even though the contract explicitly excludes the transfer of french nuclear know-how .
there are also investments planned in industrial and harbour facilities .
the project will cost the brazilian government around 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.4 billion -rrb- and will be financed by a consortium made up of six european banks .
the military cooperation includes the purchase of 36 french fighter planes , a deal that will give brazil one of the most advanced combat aircraft in latin america .
a valuable investment ?
however , german defence experts are sceptical about the military cooperation .
they believe the billion-euro treaty , which will boost brazil 's military capacity , could trigger an arms race on the continent , without bringing the advantages , which the brazilian government expects .
" right now it is hard to say whether this project will be successful indeed from a technological perspective and whether it will give brazil military advantages compared to other countries .
an ambitious project like this can also turn out to be a failure , " says ottfried nassauer , who is the head of the berlin information center for transatlantic security .
according to nassauer the cooperation with france should not cause any concern for the neighboring countries , as the understanding among the governments on the continent is good .
but he thinks that the money could be invested better elsewhere .
" the question which luiz inacio lula da silva 's government should ask is whether the investments are not too high and whether it is worth it , to spend such large amounts of money for its own political and military status .
there are many other social and economical fields , where the same kind of money most likely would create many more jobs and possibly lead to more transfer of technology .
military technology always costs more than civil technology , " says nassauer .
regional predominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bilateral deal could anger some of brazil 's regional neighbors political scientist daniel flemes , who is an expert for defence politics with the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg , fears that the cooperation with france can cause problems for the cooperation with latin american neighbors and lead to a regional arms race .
" the fact that brazil gains technological know-how out of partnerships outside of latin america , could trigger an arms race on the continent and hinder defence cooperation with the neighbouring countries , " flemes says .
he believes that brazil not only wants to secure its regional predominance with the contract , but is also striving to become a super power . " the country is trying to stabilise its regional predominance , not only on an economical and political , but on a military level as well .
simultaneously it wishes to expand its influence as an emerging country internationally , " flemes says .
but he also thinks brazil 's ambitions are a natural development , as some of its neighbors are expanding their military strength as well .
" some neighboring countries are modernising their military infrastructure .
venezuela spent four billion euros in the last four or five years on arms imports from russia .
also chile has increased its defence budget over the past years .
so brazil does n't stand alone with its military investments .
over the past five years time the total amount of defence expenditure in south america has more than doubled , " say flemes .

the country has to make sure students are literate , one expert told dw . as the world observes world literacy day , there are estimated to be 776 million people who are unable to read or write , according to the united nations .
that statistic led un secretary-general ban ki-moon to call for increased effort in the fight to end illiteracy . " in a world of enormous wealth and in a world where education and knowledge are the keys to a better life , the extent of global illiteracy is shocking , " he said .
" education gives people the tools they need to improve their living situation and take part in public decision making . " while the days of marking official documents with an " x " are long past for the vast majority of germans , not being able to read or write remains a problem that is growing more acute as jobs requiring few skills dry up , according to peter hubertus , the head of germany 's federal literacy association .

the young artist who organized the market is collecting her customers ' private tales for a radio play . for a modest polka-dotted dress in green and white you 'll have to spend 10 minutes talking about morals and chastity .
a necklace is worth five minutes about a dirty little secret .
and for three books , you 'll have to tell something you 've never told anyone before . " of course , i am curious , " said 26-year-old alexandra mueller , the instigator and organizer of the berlin 's so-called " intimate flea market . " each conversation is recorded and will later be woven together dramaturgically into a radio play .
the moments she enjoys the most are when her conversation partners forget she is there and just keep talking to themselves . give and take " i do n't think i 'll ever manage to have functioning relationships , " said a girl who wanted to be called sonja .
the price tag on the green cap she was " paying for " called for six minutes about a breakup .
" in my last relationship everything broke down and we fought every day . -lrb- … -rrb- it was a slow and painful breakup . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would you confess for a pair of green shoes ?
nils , 24 , was willing to share a secret he 'd never told anyone before - in return for three second-hand books . " in seventh grade , it was really important how much experience you had with girls , " he told mueller .
" i told my friends i 'd slept with a girl , but i had n't .
i invented the story about a girl i 'd met at camp .
that 's really embarrassing for me . " anther woman talked about her life on the street as a drug addict , said mueller .
" and then there was a french lady who wouldn ’ t stop talking .
she talked to me about her ' inner garden ' for 20 minutes , without me asking any questions - that was really weird . ' mueller is prepared to listen - at least for 5 to 20 minutes , depending on the item she 's selling .
but she 's also ready to talk - not only does she collect secrets , she also accepts items to sell in exchange for personal stories of her own . for a pair of shoes mueller talks about where she sees herself in 30 years . " to me , performance art has always been a way to express myself , " she said .
" performance art does not have to be subtle and abstract ; it can mean talking to normal people and involving them . " rethinking data protection the flea market-based radio play is n't mueller ’ s first artistic project .
in april 2007 she created a performance called " do n't cry .
work ! " for one week , she did any job she was asked to do - except soliciting .
she was surprised about how much people told her about their lives and personal details while she was working for them . " i had the feeling that people bought my time , " she said . according to mueller 's experience , the information age has made people more willing to share personal information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexandra mueller says people are willing to talk " i want people to think about how they give their data to other people , " said mueller .
" when they have to tell me stories about their sex life or stuff like that , they get a feeling for this situation of giving data away . " maybe in their real life they will think about it too . " one show , two stages mueller 's two-way secret-telling performances began in august in an art gallery in the prenzlauer berg neighborhood of berlin .
in early september , she moved into an old post office in the neukoelln district , where she intends to stay through sept .
27 . the old post office is particularly suited to mueller 's concept : in the past , people wrote their secrets down on paper and brought them to the post office to buy a stamp and send them to far-away friend .
today , they meet müller in the post office and tell their secrets without sealing them . i wanted to perform in two very different parts of berlin , she explained : " prenzlauer berg is more the manhattan of berlin ; it 's very flashy and there are a lot of young people .
neukoelln is more the bronx of berlin ; there are a lot of foreigners here . " and the more varied the intimate stories are , the more interesting mueller 's radio play will become .

" every innocent person who is killed in afghanistan is one too many , " merkel told parliamentarians in berlin .
while promising a thorough investigation and a full report on the raid , which is believed to have left dozens of taliban militants as well as civilians dead , merkel slammed critics for drawing premature conclusions .
" i will ensure that we will not put a gloss on anything .
i will also ensure that we will not accept any premature judgments .
and having experienced what i have in recent days , i say very clearly : i will not take this from anyone , either here in germany or from abroad , " she said .
on saturday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner had called the airstrike a " big mistake . "
afghan president hamid karzai had told french daily le figaro in an interview published on monday that the attack was an " error of judgment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike targeted two fuel trucks that were hijacked by taliban militants " militarily necessary and correct " the german defense ministry on monday described the airstrike as " militarily necessary and correct " because it prevented the taliban from using the two hijacked fuel trucks as mobile bombs .

with 91.6 percent of votes counted , president hamid karzai has an absolute majority of 54.1 percent . this is the first time that the figures show that president hamid karzai has enough votes to win in a single round and avoid a runoff poll .
figures released by afghanistan 's independent electoral commission -lrb- iec -rrb- give karzai a commanding lead with 54.1 percent , with 91.6 percent of all votes counted so far .
karzai 's nearest rival , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , is well behind with 28.3 percent .
nearly 5.5 million valid votes have been counted so far , the iec said .
karzai has 2,959,093 votes against abdullah 's 1,546,490 , the electoral commission announced at a news conference on tuesday .
the electoral commission announced on sunday that it had discarded around 200,000 ballots from 447 polling sites nationally where it had found vote fraud .
partial recount ordered on tuesday , the un-backed independent election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- said it too had clear evidence of fraud in the election . the body said it received more than 2,000 complaints , about a third of which could impact the final result .
" in the course of its investigations , the election complaints commission has found clear and convincing evidence of fraud in a number of polling stations , " the ecc said in a statement .
it did not say which candidate gained from the fraud , or where the suspicious ballots had been cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans voted amid taliban threats of violence the ecc has ordered the electoral commission to review votes from 600 more polling stations .
these include stations where a single candidate received more than 95 percent of the votes and those where more than 600 votes were cast , the most that could be cast a single station .
polling stations with suspiciously high voter participation , given a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , are also to be reviewed .
the low turnout , accredited to taliban voter intimidation and violence , is also threatening to cast doubt on the credibility of the process and the legitimacy of the winner .
preliminary results from 100 percent of votes cast across the country are expected to be announced on thursday .
karzai must have 50 percent of all ballots cast , plus one extra ballot , to be declared the winner .
final official results are not due before sept .

" every innocent person who is killed in afghanistan is one too many , " merkel told parliamentarians in berlin .
while promising a thorough investigation and a full report on the raid , which is believed to have left dozens of taliban militants as well as civilians dead , merkel slammed critics for drawing premature conclusions .
" i will ensure that we will not put a gloss on anything .
i will also ensure that we will not accept any premature judgments .
and having experienced what i have in recent days , i say very clearly : i will not take this from anyone , either here in germany or from abroad , " she said .
on saturday , french foreign minister bernard kouchner had called the airstrike a " big mistake . "
afghan president hamid karzai had told french daily le figaro in an interview published on monday that the attack was an " error of judgment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airstrike targeted two fuel trucks that were hijacked by taliban militants " militarily necessary and correct " the german defense ministry on monday described the airstrike as " militarily necessary and correct " because it prevented the taliban from using the two hijacked fuel trucks as mobile bombs .
germany defense minister franz josef jung of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- has faced criticism over his information policy as well as calls for him to step down .
his ministry had initially said that the airstrike had only killed taliban militants .
however , on monday jung was forced to acknowledge that he could no longer rule out any civilian casualties , and on tuesday the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan indicated for the first time that civilians were probably killed in the attack , however , without providing any exact casualty figures .
" believing civilians were not in the area , the local isaf commander authorized an airstrike , which destroyed the two fuel trucks , " isaf said in a statement .
" subsequent review has led isaf to believe that along with insurgents , civilians also were killed and injured in the strike . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defence minister jung says the airstrike was necessary not an election campaign with all but one german political party supporting the government 's stance on the afghanistan mission , parliamentarians were quick to affirm on tuesday that the tragic incident would not be exploited as a campaign issue ahead of the sept .
27 national election .
the only party in the bundestag calling for the immediate withdrawal of germany 's 4,200 troops is the left party .
" we want german troops out of afghanistan because we are firmly convinced that the mission does nothing for international security , nothing for peace and is not the way to counter international terrorism , " oskar lafontaine , the co-leader of the opposition left told parliament on tuesday .
however , the left party and its leaders have a reputation in germany for demanding what is currently popular rather than politically expedient .
even before the airstrike controversy , a poll in july showed that up to 69 percent of germans wanted their soldiers to pull out of afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine , co-leader of the left party , wants germany out of afghanistan government remains committed despite the german public 's reservations over the afghanistan mission , the chancellor has refrained from giving any pullout date for german forces , and she also sidestepped the issue during her speech on tuesday .
instead , merkel drew attention to what had brought international forces to the war-torn country in the first place .
" it was afghanistan , controlled by the taliban and al qaeda , that was the breeding ground for the terror of september 11 , " merkel said .
" the september 11 attacks were followed by dreadful attacks in europe - in madrid and in london .
we know too that germany is in their sights ...
the engagement in afghanistan is our reaction to terror .
that 's where it came from , not the other way around . "
merkel also referred to a joint german-british-franco proposal for an international conference this year to pressure the afghan government to take on more responsibilities , enabling the withdrawal of coalition forces .
" for germany , britain and france , this conference is about creating the conditions for developing an internationally agreed handover strategy , " merkel said on tuesday .
" our overriding political goal is and remains an afghanistan that can handle its own security . "
it was unclear where and when the conference would be held , but the united nations , which is to host the event , has proposed kabul as the venue. nk / reuters / afp / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 08.09.2009 europe slams us plans for new tourist levy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility european travelers entering the us may be faced with a new levy in the future .
the plans by us lawmakers could trigger a trans-atlantic tit-for-tat response with travelers on both sides footing the bill . the european union has raised objections over us plans to introduce a $ 10 charge for travelers entering the us .
if the planned levy is deemed equivalent to a visa , eu lawmakers might decide to retaliate , by forcing entry-visas on us visitors to the 27-member bloc .
currently , 29 european countries are part of the us visa waiver program -lrb- among 35 countries worldwide -rrb- , permitting european tourists to enter the united states without a visa .
however , the us introduced an online registration process earlier this year , requiring european visitors to confirm their visa-free status , three days before their departure - a move that irritated eu officials in brussels at the time .
the european commission signaled that if the us changed the requirements of its electronic system for travel authorization -lrb- esta -rrb- , the eu might be forced to review its own position .
" the introduction of a fee by the us , would require a new assessment of the european commission ... to evaluate whether the esta system , is tantamount to a visa or not , " said commission spokesman michele cercone .
scanning for terrorists eu officials believe a fee would also discourage european visitors from registering online , which - as cercone argued - would undermine the security objectives of the system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe may retaliate if the us introduces its $ 10 levy " the introduction of such a fee would constitute a step backward in our joint endeavor to ease transatlantic mobility , " cercone said .
that argument resonates with european civil liberties groups , which see the electronic registration process - with or without a fee - as an invasion of privacy rights .
they say the us has no right to the personal information of eu citizens .
the us argues that information is crucial in the fight against terrorism .
washington says the system gives us intelligence officials a 72 hours ' heads-up ' if unwanted visitors -lrb- or would-be terrorists -rrb- are planning to travel to the us .
officials in brussels are reluctant to comment further , stressing the plan to introduce a $ 10 charge is still being debated in washington .
but other eu representatives have been less cautious .
" only in ' alice in wonderland ' could a penalty be seen as promoting the activity on which it is imposed , " the european commission 's ambassador to the united states , john bruton , said . other eu objections , especially in countries where credit cards are less widely used , include the question of how any levy would be paid .
there is a growing sense in brussels , that forcing europeans to pay $ 10 to enter the united states by credit card and online only discriminates against those visitors who neither use the internet nor possess a credit card .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe fears the us levy plans could impede trans-atlantic mobility the $ 10 registration fee , which would last two years before having to be renewed , has been described by us lawmakers as ' nominal . '
they say the money generated by the registration fee , would go towards teaching visitors how to use the electronic registration process as well as other programs to promote travel to the us .
the weakest link another source of tension between the eu and us over the visa waiver program , involves the way the deal is negotiated .
eu officials argue washington should stop negotiating with individual eu countries bilaterally , and instead , work with the european union has a whole .
but washington insiders accuse the eu of hypocrisy , arguing that if eu unity is so important to the europeans , then individual countries benefiting from the visa waiver program should be prepared to give it up in solidarity with those eu member states that continue to be excluded .
us administration officials also insist there are live security threats in europe .
washington clearly views greece as problematic .
it is the only ' old ' eu member state which has been denied the visa waiver program .
us intelligence does not trust greek passport security and is unconvinced by athens ' commitment to fighting terrorism and extremists .
but brussels argues , no eu member state should be left in limbo - and negotiating with one eu country , should mean , negotiating with all .

the legislation is the culmination of a decades-long battle for justice on behalf of those who turned their backs on hitler 's forces .
' war treason ' was a vague judicial term from the pre-nazi period .
the nazis applied it to soldiers , and finally even civilians , in various situations : for desecrating an image of adolf hitler , for having the wrong political attitude , for conversing with prisoners of war , for warning or helping persecuted jews , or for dealing on the black market , to name a few .
difficult legislation historians estimate that nazi military tribunals sentenced about 30,000 people to death for desertion or treason during the war ; 20,000 were executed .
an estimated 100,000 people received prison sentences .
if they survived , it was with a criminal record .
finding work became a problem , and they were branded for their " betrayal of the fatherland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumann 's death sentence became a prison sentence germany 's major political parties had first declined to support the current legislation because it was brought before parliament by the left party .
many of the party 's leading figures were once members of the communist party of former east germany .
the parties finally agreed to sponsor the bill when the left party removed itself from the list of backers .
arbitrary rulings under the treason law conservative politicians had opposed collective rehabilitation , calling instead for a case-by-case review to determine whether there had been any " legitimate " convictions .
but a justice ministry review headed by hans hugo klein , a former judge at the constitutional court , established that the nazis ' treason law was a merciless instrument of repression , and was so vague that it gave room to arbitrary rulings .
rehabilitation of the ' war-time traitors ' will be a long-delayed victory for one man in particular : ludwig baumann , 87 , who in 1990 founded the federal association of victims of nazi military justice .
since then he has fought an uphill battle against prejudice and bureaucracy to see the records wiped clean .
he is the sole survivor of the group who initiated the association 20 years ago .
" i did n't want to be part of it any longer " baumann was an infantryman in occupied france when he deserted his regiment in 1942 .
he was caught and tortured and spent 10 months in a death cell .
his sentence was converted to 12 years imprisonment , and he was sent to the army prison in torgau , germany .
he survived , but when he returned to germany after the war , he found that the stigma of treason clung to him .
" i received many death threats .
we were treated like as cowards , scumbags and traitors .
no one was on our side . "
one group left to fight for it took years before opinion started to turn .
finally , in 1998 and 2002 , laws were passed that rehabilitated conscientious objectors , those found guilty of undermining the war effort , spies and deserters – among them baumann himself .
that left the small group of those charged with military treason - and baumann continued his battle on their behalf , despite the fact that his own honor had been restored .
according to baumann , 68 death sentences were handed down for wartime treason , and they were all executed but for one .
general walther von seydlitz-kurzbach survived because he was by that time a russian prisoner of war .
baumann is pleased that parliament is about to close one of the last chapter 's of nazi military arbitrariness .
but that does not mean he has forgotten the past : “ it was such a horror , it hounds me to this very day . ” db / afp / dpa / epd editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 08.09.2009 german analyst plays down trans-atlantic rift over airstrike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the role of germans in afghanistan is a bone of contention a nato airstrike ordered by a german commander in afghanistan 's kunduz province may have sparked a rift between berlin and washington .
one observer gave dw his view on the debate over germany 's isaf mission . the german government has defended friday 's airstrike , in which at least 54 people were killed , saying that german troops were at immediate risk .
berlin said there are no confirmed reports that civilians were killed at all in the airstrike near kunduz , although the us commander in afghanistan says he believes some of the dead probably were non-combatants . dw spoke to henning rieke , is a senior member of the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
dw : is there a rift between the us and germany developing ?
i do n't believe there is a rift or that there are profound differences between the us and germany , that were not there before the air attack on the two tankers .
the americans are expecting the germans to do more in afghanistan , to be more flexible , to send more troops , to be available for combat in the south and the germans refuse to do that .
this has been a constant problem .
both sides have now come closer together in many other aspects of the afghanistan strategy , especially under the obama administration .
but what we have today is a kind of bickering between american nato sources and german sources on how many people died in the air attacks .
so , what we have is probably a lashing at the germans , maybe at the working level , but i do n't see this as a tactical move by the american government .
dw : could this be a type of payback for the germans because they have n't been involved in southern afghanistan ?
i do n't believe that .
if the american government had wanted the germans to be more open to combat missions in afghanistan , then they should have done the exact opposite .
they should have played down the civilian losses in the wake of the bombing .
they should argue that this is normal warfare , and not point to the specifics of the situation , not leak information that seems to be , in my opinion , exaggerated .
they should rather try to calm the situation , because now the german public is aroused and might be more opposed to a more forceful role in afghanistan .
so i believe it was officers on the working level that decided to take revenge on the germans - but this is not american policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is jung 's responsibility to support his officer , rieke says dw : now there are still conflicting reports and isaf has launched an official investigation but defense minister franz josef jung remains certain that his commanding officer on the ground did the right thing under the circumstances .
why is he doing that ?
first of all i think it is his responsibility to support the officer .
but he has also said it is absolutely necessary to have an in-depth scrutiny of what happened that night .
i believe that according to the data and information that jung had , it was obvious that the decision taken was appropriate . if further information comes available he might change his mind .
dw : what are consequences for the isaf mission in the future ?
it could mean on the one hand that the afghans become more and more frustrated with the forceful profile of the isaf forces and it might also cause additonal civilian killings out of combat .
but it could also mean that there is more resolve on the side of all isaf partners to avoid exactly these civilians killings and to take more care that only the taliban are hit during combat .
this is a difficult task , but i think the germans and the americans have come to a consensus on this point , that you can not win a war against terror if you alienate the afghan people at the same time .
dw : it 's hard to imagine a soldier having to face a civilian court over a decision taken while in uniform .
but that 's the situation that every german commander faces today .
is that a realistic scenario ?
there is no military prosecution for wrongdoings in the military .
in the us if something like this happened there would be a jag -lrb- judge advocate general - eds . -rrb- procedure and you would keep this inside the military .
we do n't have a military judiciary and there are historical reasons for this . i do n't believe that this will change .
now what has been changed , and it might sound ridiculous for outside ears , is that the district attorney who is responsible for the area of the peacetime deployment is now responsible for scrutinizing or looking into the affairs in afghanistan .
that 's the attorney in potsdam , near berlin , where the headquarters of the german forces in operation is situated , so there will be a specialized unit of the civilian judiciary looking into these military affairs .
but we wo n't have a military judiciary and i think that 's quite ok .
i do n't see that as a big problem .

lord neuberger fears the new final court of appeal could assert itself in opposition to the government .
he says there is a real risk of " judges arrogating to themselves greater power than they have at the moment " .
the new court president 's lord phillips said such an outcome was " a possibility " , but was " unlikely " .
lord neuberger has stepped down from the law lords and returns to the court of appeal next month as head of its civil division with the title of master of the rolls .
' peril ' in an interview for radio 4 's top dogs : britain 's new supreme court , he suggested that the supreme court had been created " as a result of what appears to have been a last-minute decision over a glass of whisky " .
" the danger is that you muck around with a constitution like the british constitution at your peril because you do not know what the consequences of any change will be , " he said .

" it has been alleged that this was all thought up on the back of a fag packet , " the former cabinet secretary told the programme .

" the supreme court will be bolder in vindicating both the freedoms of individuals and , coupled with that , being willing to take on the executive , " he said .
