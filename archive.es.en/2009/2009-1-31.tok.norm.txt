brown said that climate change would feature prominently at the next g20 meeting in april as it was " essential to recovery of the world economy . "
" the main obstacle during 2009 on the road to copenhagen may be the financial crisis , " said danish prime minister anders rasmussen .
in december , representatives of most countries will gather in copenhagen , denmark and attempt to knock out a new climate deal , but some environmentalists have expressed concern that not enough will be done before then to enable the nations to reach an agreement .
" we have to get it right in copenhagen , there is no second chance here , " said yvo de boer , head of the un 's framework convention on climate change .
" we must decide to put a price on carbon , " said al gore , the former us vice president , adding that president barack obama would play a positive role in combating climate change .
" he is pushing hard for dramatic and bold moves in the right direction , " said gore , noting that the house of representatives had passed a stimulus bill , " the largest component of which is a green stimulus . "
" we must appreciate the magnitude of change in united state 's leadership , " said gore .
the previous administration in washington , dc , was accused of hindering attempts to reach agreements on climate change .
alternative energy sources as economic benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts at davos say alternative energy can help the economy panelists at sessions in davos said alternative energies , to replace oil , coal and other sources of power which emit carbon dioxide and create pollution , would also have economic advantages and help spur the economy , and could be an essential part of spurring the world out of the downturn .
ban compared advancing green technologies to " killing two birds with one stone . "
reaching the goals in copenhagen , rasmussen said , would require industrialized and developing nations to work together to set reduction targets .
carbon trading seen as a way forward with the issues of climate change and the global economic crisis coming to a head simultaneously , world leaders have focused on tying the two together , and businessmen saturday were trying to find ways to make money from a green economy . europe 's carbon credit trading program , in its second phase , is seen as being on the path to putting a price on pollution and creating a market that would allow for profit making . " pricing and cost will force a lot of adjustment for people , " said pierre lagrange , an alternative energy investor , but added that a trading program " could only work if it were globally accepted . " he said europe 's politicians have expressed interest in setting more aggressive carbon reduction goals , if the rest of the world got on board . with the 192 countries planning to meet in december in copenhagen , in attempt to reach a new global climate deal , engaging with developing nations will be crucial to the outcome of the process . scheme plans to trade carbon like currency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries could trade carbon credits like currency capping carbon emissions would force producers who exceed their permitted output amounts to buy credits from companies who have not , creating new jobs in the new market and also reducing carbon outputs by attaching a price to it . to get people trading across borders , lars josefsson , from the large european power producer vattenfall , suggested treating the credits in each country - which would each likely introduce its own system - like currency exchanges , which let people with one brand of cash do business with someone with another . " this is a pragmatic way to go about globalizing cap and trade markets , " he said , referring to the markets to cap or limit carbon emissions by trading them . ultimately , lagrange said , the caps on emissions will have to be extended to the user , and not only to the energy producer . " the place to start is behavior change , " said us congressman brian baird .
" the goal should be 20 per cent reduction in 20 weeks .
just walk through your daily life and see how much you can reduce . " " energy efficiency is very doable , and 50 per cent of the solution , " said nic frances , who runs a company which focuses on reducing power consumption .
" it 's what we do in our homes , domestic energy efficiency . " fears of greedy exploitation of carbon trading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing electric and hybrid cars would create jobs concerns though have been made that carbon trading would lead to yet another market which could be used for profit without bringing about the needed improvements to the environment , while also it would inhibit the creation of new technologies and instead focusing on cleaning up the old ones . " cap and trade is fine , " said daniel sperling , an author of two billion cars , a book focusing on the growing number of polluting vehicles in the world . " but we need something more technology forcing , which stimulates innovations , " sperling , a transportation expert , told the dpa news agency , adding that the economy would benefit . in his own field , he said , new , cleaner cars would create more jobs . " you can lower costs , create jobs and reduce lethal overheating , " said baird , using his preferred term in place of climate change , " and put money back in the pockets of consumers . " hopes were pinned on the new us administration taking the steps to make it happen . " if we turn climate change into an opportunity , it is the biggest opportunity since world war two , " said josefsson , referring to the economic expansion that was brought about as a result of the war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
pope benedict xvi 's pardon of williamson , along with three other ultra-conservative bishops , has threatened the vatican 's relationship with jewish leaders and led to an outburst of criticism within the catholic church .
two weeks ago , in an interview with swedish state television , williamson said " historical evidence is hugely against 6 million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on jan .

heavy burden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson has apologized to the pope for " distress " caused by his " imprudent " comments the president of germany 's jewish central committee , charlotte knobloch , made it clear on friday that the vatican 's decision weighed heavily on the relationship between jews and catholics .
in light of the pope 's german nationality , knobloch said she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . "
former chief rabbi israel meir lau , a survivor of buchenwald concentration camp , was quoted in spiegel asking , " how can such a liar be granted the protection and pardon of the leader of the catholic church ? "
german catholics protest german catholics have also reacted strongly to benedict 's decision .
in the city of muenster , where the pope once taught as a professor of theology , almost the entire catholic faculty signed a letter of protest , while theologians in the city of tuebingen described the decision as a " heavy burden " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of catholics have been disappointed by the pope swiss theologian hans kueng , speaking on german radio rbb , accused benedict of being out of touch with his " kingdom " .
in kueng 's words , " the pope has no critical people around him . "
in light of this wave of reactions , the vatican has sought to quell the outrage .
during his weekly general audience on wednesday , benedict said the memory of the holocaust can not be cancelled through any form of denial .
the german-born pontiff also recalled his own past pilgrimages to the former nazi death camp of auschwitz .
" the images i collected during my numerous visits to auschwitz bore witness to the innocent victims of a racial hatred , " he said .
questioning the church ?
spiegel reported that some german catholics are questioning their adherence to the church .
helmut reinhard , a catholic living in the city of munich , lost 15 members of his family in auschwitz-birkenau , " all of them gypsies , " he told the magazine , " and all of them catholic . "
as a result of the pope 's pardon , reinhard 's brother markus had left the catholic church , together with his wife and her four sisters , on holocaust memorial day .
now he too has had enough , he told the magazine , and was renouncing his membership .

during his weekly general audience on wednesday , benedict said the memory of the holocaust can not be cancelled through any form of denial .
the german-born pontiff also recalled his own past pilgrimages to the former nazi death camp of auschwitz .
" the images i collected during my numerous visits to auschwitz bore witness to the innocent victims of a racial hatred , " he said .
questioning the church ?
spiegel reported that some german catholics are questioning their adherence to the church .
helmut reinhard , a catholic living in the city of munich , lost 15 members of his family in auschwitz-birkenau , " all of them gypsies , " he told the magazine , " and all of them catholic . "
as a result of the pope 's pardon , reinhard 's brother markus had left the catholic church , together with his wife and her four sisters , on holocaust memorial day .
now he too has had enough , he told the magazine , and was renouncing his membership .
german public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his remarks .

"
pope benedict xvi 's pardon of williamson , along with three other ultra-conservative bishops , has threatened the vatican 's relationship with jewish leaders and led to an outburst of criticism within the catholic church .
two weeks ago , in an interview with swedish state television , williamson said " historical evidence is hugely against 6 million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on jan .

in light of the pope 's german nationality , knobloch said she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . "
former chief rabbi israel meir lau , a survivor of buchenwald concentration camp , was quoted in spiegel asking , " how can such a liar be granted the protection and pardon of the leader of the catholic church ? "
german catholics protest german catholics have also reacted strongly to benedict 's decision .
in the city of muenster , where the pope once taught as a professor of theology , almost the entire catholic faculty signed a letter of protest , while theologians in the city of tuebingen described the decision as a " heavy burden " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 31.01.2009 world leaders at davos call for climate to remain in focus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world faces environmental as well as economic pressures with the economic crisis likely to dominate much of 2009 , world leaders in davos urged climate change issues to remain in focus . prime minister gordon brown , german chancellor angela merkel , the un 's secretary general ban ki-moon and others attending the world economic forum warned against letting the economic worries overshadow the need to solve the climate issues as the two were interconnected .
brown said that climate change would feature prominently at the next g20 meeting in april as it was " essential to recovery of the world economy . "
" the main obstacle during 2009 on the road to copenhagen may be the financial crisis , " said danish prime minister anders rasmussen .
in december , representatives of most countries will gather in copenhagen , denmark and attempt to knock out a new climate deal , but some environmentalists have expressed concern that not enough will be done before then to enable the nations to reach an agreement .
" we have to get it right in copenhagen , there is no second chance here , " said yvo de boer , head of the un 's framework convention on climate change .
" we must decide to put a price on carbon , " said al gore , the former us vice president , adding that president barack obama would play a positive role in combating climate change .
" he is pushing hard for dramatic and bold moves in the right direction , " said gore , noting that the house of representatives had passed a stimulus bill , " the largest component of which is a green stimulus . "
" we must appreciate the magnitude of change in united state 's leadership , " said gore .
the previous administration in washington , dc , was accused of hindering attempts to reach agreements on climate change .
alternative energy sources as economic benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts at davos say alternative energy can help the economy panelists at sessions in davos said alternative energies , to replace oil , coal and other sources of power which emit carbon dioxide and create pollution , would also have economic advantages and help spur the economy , and could be an essential part of spurring the world out of the downturn .
ban compared advancing green technologies to " killing two birds with one stone . "
reaching the goals in copenhagen , rasmussen said , would require industrialized and developing nations to work together to set reduction targets .
carbon trading seen as a way forward with the issues of climate change and the global economic crisis coming to a head simultaneously , world leaders have focused on tying the two together , and businessmen saturday were trying to find ways to make money from a green economy . europe 's carbon credit trading program , in its second phase , is seen as being on the path to putting a price on pollution and creating a market that would allow for profit making . " pricing and cost will force a lot of adjustment for people , " said pierre lagrange , an alternative energy investor , but added that a trading program " could only work if it were globally accepted . " he said europe 's politicians have expressed interest in setting more aggressive carbon reduction goals , if the rest of the world got on board . with the 192 countries planning to meet in december in copenhagen , in attempt to reach a new global climate deal , engaging with developing nations will be crucial to the outcome of the process . scheme plans to trade carbon like currency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries could trade carbon credits like currency capping carbon emissions would force producers who exceed their permitted output amounts to buy credits from companies who have not , creating new jobs in the new market and also reducing carbon outputs by attaching a price to it . to get people trading across borders , lars josefsson , from the large european power producer vattenfall , suggested treating the credits in each country - which would each likely introduce its own system - like currency exchanges , which let people with one brand of cash do business with someone with another . " this is a pragmatic way to go about globalizing cap and trade markets , " he said , referring to the markets to cap or limit carbon emissions by trading them . ultimately , lagrange said , the caps on emissions will have to be extended to the user , and not only to the energy producer . " the place to start is behavior change , " said us congressman brian baird .
" the goal should be 20 per cent reduction in 20 weeks .
just walk through your daily life and see how much you can reduce . " " energy efficiency is very doable , and 50 per cent of the solution , " said nic frances , who runs a company which focuses on reducing power consumption .
" it 's what we do in our homes , domestic energy efficiency . " fears of greedy exploitation of carbon trading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing electric and hybrid cars would create jobs concerns though have been made that carbon trading would lead to yet another market which could be used for profit without bringing about the needed improvements to the environment , while also it would inhibit the creation of new technologies and instead focusing on cleaning up the old ones . " cap and trade is fine , " said daniel sperling , an author of two billion cars , a book focusing on the growing number of polluting vehicles in the world . " but we need something more technology forcing , which stimulates innovations , " sperling , a transportation expert , told the dpa news agency , adding that the economy would benefit . in his own field , he said , new , cleaner cars would create more jobs . " you can lower costs , create jobs and reduce lethal overheating , " said baird , using his preferred term in place of climate change , " and put money back in the pockets of consumers . " hopes were pinned on the new us administration taking the steps to make it happen . " if we turn climate change into an opportunity , it is the biggest opportunity since world war two , " said josefsson , referring to the economic expansion that was brought about as a result of the war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 . piebalgs spoke of unity after german chancellor angela merkel asked the 27-member bloc to support the nord stream pipeline , which would bring russian natural gas under the baltic sea directly to germany . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country chairs the eu until june 30 , said tuesday that nord stream , as a pipeline deepening the eu 's reliance on russian gas , was " a direct threat to the nabucco project " that would skip russia as a supplier . speaking to reporters at an energy security conference in the northeastern czech city of ostrava , piebalgs said that the eu has backed nord stream as " one of the alternative routes . " " there is an agreement on this pipeline .

president barack obama stands for change , but one white house practice endures : appointing non-career diplomats to plum postings abroad . within his first two days in office , president barack obama named richard holbrooke and george mitchell as special envoys to the world 's hot spots and the senate unanimously confirmed susan rice as us ambassador to the united nations .
now obama will need to fill the top diplomatic posts in prestigious world capitals such as london , paris , moscow and tokyo as well as the sunny caribbean .
although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .
“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .
and now that caroline kennedy , an early obama supporter , has withdrawn from the new york senate race , the british national newspapers are even speculating that jfk 's daughter could follow the steps of her grandfather joseph p. kennedy as us ambassador in london . holbrooke served in newly reunified germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy 's grandfather was us ambassador to britain germany too has had its share of distinguished us ambassadors , who have been heavy hitters in foreign policy arena : walter stoessel had been us ambassador to the soviet union and interim secretary of state in 1982 ; vernon walters , a former un ambassador and deputy cia chief , was renowned for his linguistic prowess ; john kornblum , a career diplomat , had played a key role in the east-west détente that led to the end of the cold war , and richard holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan .
such an illustrious precedent has made the last two bush appointees — dan coats , an indiana senator and william timken , an ohio industrialist , both who speak no german , look somewhat pale in comparison .
joerg duppler , berlin director of the atlantic treaty association , who knows timken , feels that us-german ties are so close that who the american ambassador is has little impact on bilateral relations anyway .
“ timken did his job well .
he represented his president .
his job was n't to be popular with germans , ” said duppler . the devil who wears prada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wintour was the inspiration behind " devil wears prada " one of europe 's most coveted posts is paris , where two recent american ambassadors were hugely popular with the french elite . in a country where benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson once served , british-born pamela churchill harriman was long on pedigree , but short on experience .
linked by marriage to some of the most powerful men of the 20th century , harriman , a big fundraiser for the democratic party , had served during former president bill clinton 's first term .
her successor was felix rohatyn , the lazard freres investment banker , who had rescued new york city from bankruptcy in the 1970s .
“ they could n't have been more different , but were each very effective in their own way .
she was the socialite star ; he was the business intellectual star .
then there was arthur hartman , that rare career diplomat , who was a true professional .
the rest you do n't remember , " said ifri 's moisi . rumor has it that another american with a british accent could become obama 's ambassador to france .
fashion icon anna wintour , the editor of vogue magazine , hosted fundraisers for obama and got some big names behind his campaign .
moisi was amused by the thought that wintour , who reportedly inspired the chick lit novel " the devil wears prada " could be up for paris .
" why not ?

president barack obama stands for change , but one white house practice endures : appointing non-career diplomats to plum postings abroad . within his first two days in office , president barack obama named richard holbrooke and george mitchell as special envoys to the world 's hot spots and the senate unanimously confirmed susan rice as us ambassador to the united nations .
now obama will need to fill the top diplomatic posts in prestigious world capitals such as london , paris , moscow and tokyo as well as the sunny caribbean .
although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .
“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .
and now that caroline kennedy , an early obama supporter , has withdrawn from the new york senate race , the british national newspapers are even speculating that jfk 's daughter could follow the steps of her grandfather joseph p. kennedy as us ambassador in london . holbrooke served in newly reunified germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy 's grandfather was us ambassador to britain germany too has had its share of distinguished us ambassadors , who have been heavy hitters in foreign policy arena : walter stoessel had been us ambassador to the soviet union and interim secretary of state in 1982 ; vernon walters , a former un ambassador and deputy cia chief , was renowned for his linguistic prowess ; john kornblum , a career diplomat , had played a key role in the east-west détente that led to the end of the cold war , and richard holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan .

president barack obama stands for change , but one white house practice endures : appointing non-career diplomats to plum postings abroad . within his first two days in office , president barack obama named richard holbrooke and george mitchell as special envoys to the world 's hot spots and the senate unanimously confirmed susan rice as us ambassador to the united nations .
now obama will need to fill the top diplomatic posts in prestigious world capitals such as london , paris , moscow and tokyo as well as the sunny caribbean .
although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .
“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .
and now that caroline kennedy , an early obama supporter , has withdrawn from the new york senate race , the british national newspapers are even speculating that jfk 's daughter could follow the steps of her grandfather joseph p. kennedy as us ambassador in london . holbrooke served in newly reunified germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy 's grandfather was us ambassador to britain germany too has had its share of distinguished us ambassadors , who have been heavy hitters in foreign policy arena : walter stoessel had been us ambassador to the soviet union and interim secretary of state in 1982 ; vernon walters , a former un ambassador and deputy cia chief , was renowned for his linguistic prowess ; john kornblum , a career diplomat , had played a key role in the east-west détente that led to the end of the cold war , and richard holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan .
such an illustrious precedent has made the last two bush appointees — dan coats , an indiana senator and william timken , an ohio industrialist , both who speak no german , look somewhat pale in comparison .
joerg duppler , berlin director of the atlantic treaty association , who knows timken , feels that us-german ties are so close that who the american ambassador is has little impact on bilateral relations anyway .
“ timken did his job well .
he represented his president .
his job was n't to be popular with germans , ” said duppler . the devil who wears prada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wintour was the inspiration behind " devil wears prada " one of europe 's most coveted posts is paris , where two recent american ambassadors were hugely popular with the french elite . in a country where benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson once served , british-born pamela churchill harriman was long on pedigree , but short on experience .
linked by marriage to some of the most powerful men of the 20th century , harriman , a big fundraiser for the democratic party , had served during former president bill clinton 's first term .
her successor was felix rohatyn , the lazard freres investment banker , who had rescued new york city from bankruptcy in the 1970s .
“ they could n't have been more different , but were each very effective in their own way .
she was the socialite star ; he was the business intellectual star .
then there was arthur hartman , that rare career diplomat , who was a true professional .
the rest you do n't remember , " said ifri 's moisi . rumor has it that another american with a british accent could become obama 's ambassador to france .
fashion icon anna wintour , the editor of vogue magazine , hosted fundraisers for obama and got some big names behind his campaign .
moisi was amused by the thought that wintour , who reportedly inspired the chick lit novel " the devil wears prada " could be up for paris .
" why not ?
that would be fun .

some say its time for action despite the absence of cabinet members of the new us administration at the world economic forum , president obama is all the talk in davos .
can he reverse the ailing economy and restore america 's role in the world ? predictions of the imminent decline of the us as the major global power are nothing new .
back in 1988 , the late samuel huntington wrote a long essay about what he described as the fifth way of declinism since the 1950 's .
then , as now , economic and military factors were the major factors why many perceived the us to be on a slow but steady downward spiral as a great power .
however , there are many stark differences between 1998 and 2008 and 2009 that make it difficult to compare the periods , for example , the demise of the soviet union and the rise of islamic extremism , and most importantly , globalization .
us a constant topic in davos with the world in the midst of the biggest economic crisis since the great depression , what are the chances that the us under its new president barack obama can master the situation , and how will the us and the world be changed through this crisis ?
this is a question that is being discussed almost incessantly at the world economic forum in davos .
of course , the subject is not addressed as such , but it is the theme that runs as an undercurrent through almost any small talk or debate .
and while all the latest economic indicators signal more doom and gloom for the world 's biggest economy - house prices decline by almost 20 percent , durable goods orders decline for the fifth month in a row , unemployment skyrocketing - the amount of respect and hope business and government leaders from around the world place on president barack obama to turn the u.s. economy around and restore the country 's stature in the world is astonishing .
" i am a huge fan of barack obama , " says klaas kersting , ceo of gameforge ag , a german online gaming start-up .
" i think he had a really good start of turning things around to bring the u.s. out of its moral crisis . "
african roots a factor for obama 's popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa , and kenya in particular , have high hopes for obama arthur mutambara , deputy prime minister of zimbabwe for the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , cites a different reason why he believes president obama can bring about the change he promised during his election campaign : " being of african extraction , being a son of a kenyan , yes , he has the potential to do it .
what it requires is the confidence and the courage to do so . "
while president obama won international praise for some of the early decisions he made right after taking office , linda lorimer , vice president of yale university , makes a different argument : " i think the steps they took before the inauguration are even more important than what they have done in the first days of the administration , which is have a sense of prospect and promise .
i think those of us here who are in business or academia know that leadership today is about teamwork .
america needs to assert its leadership by showing it is part of the team of leading countries in the world and no longer is a go-it-alone kind of enterprise . "
listen , do n't patronise the sentiment expressed by lorimer that the us should again engage and cooperate with other nations is also common theme in davos .
" barack obama must make sure that on africa he listens to africans and not to come to africa and patronise africa , " says zimbabwe 's deputy prime minister mutambara .
" we in africa know what is good for ourselves and americans and the international community must listen to us not the other way around . "
even iran 's foreign minister said here in davos that his country was ready to respond if america 's policy change was genuine .
while barack obama and his administration appear to have plenty of goodwill , trust and support from around the world , the question is whether that is enough .
according to all major indicators , the economic situation in the us looks so grim that a quick way out of the misery seems all but impossible . hard struggle ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and his team face huge challenges however , even a self-declared obama fan like gameforge ceo kersting turns pessimistic when being asked about a prediction whether the new administration can reverse the downward trend .
" the economic challenges are dramatic .
the us economy is significantly suffering - finance , automotive and all the suppliers for that matter .
it is really a very big challenge and countries like china or india do n't sleep ; they grow in these times of crisis .
they grow slowly , but they still grow , so i think it is going to be a hard struggle for obama to turn this around . "
at this point , no one here in davos or anywhere else for that matter appears to know how and when america 's economy will come out of the crisis .
so what does that mean for people around the world who are waiting for president obama to fulfill his promise to bring change to the world ? " we ca n't possibly expect one person to solve all the ills that all of us are looking at , " says yale vice president lorimer and adds : " we have to hope that his very able team reaching out to the very able leadership around the world will find the right course of action .

some say its time for action despite the absence of cabinet members of the new us administration at the world economic forum , president obama is all the talk in davos .
can he reverse the ailing economy and restore america 's role in the world ? predictions of the imminent decline of the us as the major global power are nothing new .
back in 1988 , the late samuel huntington wrote a long essay about what he described as the fifth way of declinism since the 1950 's .
then , as now , economic and military factors were the major factors why many perceived the us to be on a slow but steady downward spiral as a great power .
however , there are many stark differences between 1998 and 2008 and 2009 that make it difficult to compare the periods , for example , the demise of the soviet union and the rise of islamic extremism , and most importantly , globalization .
us a constant topic in davos with the world in the midst of the biggest economic crisis since the great depression , what are the chances that the us under its new president barack obama can master the situation , and how will the us and the world be changed through this crisis ?
this is a question that is being discussed almost incessantly at the world economic forum in davos .
of course , the subject is not addressed as such , but it is the theme that runs as an undercurrent through almost any small talk or debate .
and while all the latest economic indicators signal more doom and gloom for the world 's biggest economy - house prices decline by almost 20 percent , durable goods orders decline for the fifth month in a row , unemployment skyrocketing - the amount of respect and hope business and government leaders from around the world place on president barack obama to turn the u.s. economy around and restore the country 's stature in the world is astonishing .
" i am a huge fan of barack obama , " says klaas kersting , ceo of gameforge ag , a german online gaming start-up .
" i think he had a really good start of turning things around to bring the u.s. out of its moral crisis . "
african roots a factor for obama 's popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa , and kenya in particular , have high hopes for obama arthur mutambara , deputy prime minister of zimbabwe for the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , cites a different reason why he believes president obama can bring about the change he promised during his election campaign : " being of african extraction , being a son of a kenyan , yes , he has the potential to do it .
what it requires is the confidence and the courage to do so . "
while president obama won international praise for some of the early decisions he made right after taking office , linda lorimer , vice president of yale university , makes a different argument : " i think the steps they took before the inauguration are even more important than what they have done in the first days of the administration , which is have a sense of prospect and promise .
i think those of us here who are in business or academia know that leadership today is about teamwork .
america needs to assert its leadership by showing it is part of the team of leading countries in the world and no longer is a go-it-alone kind of enterprise . "
listen , do n't patronise the sentiment expressed by lorimer that the us should again engage and cooperate with other nations is also common theme in davos .
" barack obama must make sure that on africa he listens to africans and not to come to africa and patronise africa , " says zimbabwe 's deputy prime minister mutambara .
" we in africa know what is good for ourselves and americans and the international community must listen to us not the other way around . "
even iran 's foreign minister said here in davos that his country was ready to respond if america 's policy change was genuine .
while barack obama and his administration appear to have plenty of goodwill , trust and support from around the world , the question is whether that is enough .
according to all major indicators , the economic situation in the us looks so grim that a quick way out of the misery seems all but impossible . hard struggle ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and his team face huge challenges however , even a self-declared obama fan like gameforge ceo kersting turns pessimistic when being asked about a prediction whether the new administration can reverse the downward trend .
" the economic challenges are dramatic .
the us economy is significantly suffering - finance , automotive and all the suppliers for that matter .
it is really a very big challenge and countries like china or india do n't sleep ; they grow in these times of crisis .
they grow slowly , but they still grow , so i think it is going to be a hard struggle for obama to turn this around . "
at this point , no one here in davos or anywhere else for that matter appears to know how and when america 's economy will come out of the crisis .
so what does that mean for people around the world who are waiting for president obama to fulfill his promise to bring change to the world ? " we ca n't possibly expect one person to solve all the ills that all of us are looking at , " says yale vice president lorimer and adds : " we have to hope that his very able team reaching out to the very able leadership around the world will find the right course of action .

brown said that climate change would feature prominently at the next g20 meeting in april as it was " essential to recovery of the world economy . "
" the main obstacle during 2009 on the road to copenhagen may be the financial crisis , " said danish prime minister anders rasmussen .
in december , representatives of most countries will gather in copenhagen , denmark and attempt to knock out a new climate deal , but some environmentalists have expressed concern that not enough will be done before then to enable the nations to reach an agreement .
" we have to get it right in copenhagen , there is no second chance here , " said yvo de boer , head of the un 's framework convention on climate change .
" we must decide to put a price on carbon , " said al gore , the former us vice president , adding that president barack obama would play a positive role in combating climate change .
" he is pushing hard for dramatic and bold moves in the right direction , " said gore , noting that the house of representatives had passed a stimulus bill , " the largest component of which is a green stimulus . "
" we must appreciate the magnitude of change in united state 's leadership , " said gore .
the previous administration in washington , dc , was accused of hindering attempts to reach agreements on climate change .
alternative energy sources as economic benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts at davos say alternative energy can help the economy panelists at sessions in davos said alternative energies , to replace oil , coal and other sources of power which emit carbon dioxide and create pollution , would also have economic advantages and help spur the economy , and could be an essential part of spurring the world out of the downturn .
ban compared advancing green technologies to " killing two birds with one stone . "
reaching the goals in copenhagen , rasmussen said , would require industrialized and developing nations to work together to set reduction targets .
carbon trading seen as a way forward with the issues of climate change and the global economic crisis coming to a head simultaneously , world leaders have focused on tying the two together , and businessmen saturday were trying to find ways to make money from a green economy . europe 's carbon credit trading program , in its second phase , is seen as being on the path to putting a price on pollution and creating a market that would allow for profit making . " pricing and cost will force a lot of adjustment for people , " said pierre lagrange , an alternative energy investor , but added that a trading program " could only work if it were globally accepted . " he said europe 's politicians have expressed interest in setting more aggressive carbon reduction goals , if the rest of the world got on board . with the 192 countries planning to meet in december in copenhagen , in attempt to reach a new global climate deal , engaging with developing nations will be crucial to the outcome of the process . scheme plans to trade carbon like currency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries could trade carbon credits like currency capping carbon emissions would force producers who exceed their permitted output amounts to buy credits from companies who have not , creating new jobs in the new market and also reducing carbon outputs by attaching a price to it . to get people trading across borders , lars josefsson , from the large european power producer vattenfall , suggested treating the credits in each country - which would each likely introduce its own system - like currency exchanges , which let people with one brand of cash do business with someone with another . " this is a pragmatic way to go about globalizing cap and trade markets , " he said , referring to the markets to cap or limit carbon emissions by trading them . ultimately , lagrange said , the caps on emissions will have to be extended to the user , and not only to the energy producer . " the place to start is behavior change , " said us congressman brian baird .
" the goal should be 20 per cent reduction in 20 weeks .
just walk through your daily life and see how much you can reduce . " " energy efficiency is very doable , and 50 per cent of the solution , " said nic frances , who runs a company which focuses on reducing power consumption .
" it 's what we do in our homes , domestic energy efficiency . " fears of greedy exploitation of carbon trading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing electric and hybrid cars would create jobs concerns though have been made that carbon trading would lead to yet another market which could be used for profit without bringing about the needed improvements to the environment , while also it would inhibit the creation of new technologies and instead focusing on cleaning up the old ones . " cap and trade is fine , " said daniel sperling , an author of two billion cars , a book focusing on the growing number of polluting vehicles in the world . " but we need something more technology forcing , which stimulates innovations , " sperling , a transportation expert , told the dpa news agency , adding that the economy would benefit . in his own field , he said , new , cleaner cars would create more jobs . " you can lower costs , create jobs and reduce lethal overheating , " said baird , using his preferred term in place of climate change , " and put money back in the pockets of consumers . " hopes were pinned on the new us administration taking the steps to make it happen . " if we turn climate change into an opportunity , it is the biggest opportunity since world war two , " said josefsson , referring to the economic expansion that was brought about as a result of the war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us a constant topic in davos with the world in the midst of the biggest economic crisis since the great depression , what are the chances that the us under its new president barack obama can master the situation , and how will the us and the world be changed through this crisis ?
this is a question that is being discussed almost incessantly at the world economic forum in davos .
of course , the subject is not addressed as such , but it is the theme that runs as an undercurrent through almost any small talk or debate .
and while all the latest economic indicators signal more doom and gloom for the world 's biggest economy - house prices decline by almost 20 percent , durable goods orders decline for the fifth month in a row , unemployment skyrocketing - the amount of respect and hope business and government leaders from around the world place on president barack obama to turn the u.s. economy around and restore the country 's stature in the world is astonishing .

what it requires is the confidence and the courage to do so . "
while president obama won international praise for some of the early decisions he made right after taking office , linda lorimer , vice president of yale university , makes a different argument : " i think the steps they took before the inauguration are even more important than what they have done in the first days of the administration , which is have a sense of prospect and promise .
i think those of us here who are in business or academia know that leadership today is about teamwork .
america needs to assert its leadership by showing it is part of the team of leading countries in the world and no longer is a go-it-alone kind of enterprise . "
listen , do n't patronise the sentiment expressed by lorimer that the us should again engage and cooperate with other nations is also common theme in davos .

" we in africa know what is good for ourselves and americans and the international community must listen to us not the other way around . "
even iran 's foreign minister said here in davos that his country was ready to respond if america 's policy change was genuine .
while barack obama and his administration appear to have plenty of goodwill , trust and support from around the world , the question is whether that is enough .
according to all major indicators , the economic situation in the us looks so grim that a quick way out of the misery seems all but impossible . hard struggle ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and his team face huge challenges however , even a self-declared obama fan like gameforge ceo kersting turns pessimistic when being asked about a prediction whether the new administration can reverse the downward trend .

the us economy is significantly suffering - finance , automotive and all the suppliers for that matter .
it is really a very big challenge and countries like china or india do n't sleep ; they grow in these times of crisis .
they grow slowly , but they still grow , so i think it is going to be a hard struggle for obama to turn this around . "
at this point , no one here in davos or anywhere else for that matter appears to know how and when america 's economy will come out of the crisis .

"
pope benedict xvi 's pardon of williamson , along with three other ultra-conservative bishops , has threatened the vatican 's relationship with jewish leaders and led to an outburst of criticism within the catholic church .
two weeks ago , in an interview with swedish state television , williamson said " historical evidence is hugely against 6 million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on jan .

heavy burden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson has apologized to the pope for " distress " caused by his " imprudent " comments the president of germany 's jewish central committee , charlotte knobloch , made it clear on friday that the vatican 's decision weighed heavily on the relationship between jews and catholics .
in light of the pope 's german nationality , knobloch said she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . "
former chief rabbi israel meir lau , a survivor of buchenwald concentration camp , was quoted in spiegel asking , " how can such a liar be granted the protection and pardon of the leader of the catholic church ? "
german catholics protest german catholics have also reacted strongly to benedict 's decision .
in the city of muenster , where the pope once taught as a professor of theology , almost the entire catholic faculty signed a letter of protest , while theologians in the city of tuebingen described the decision as a " heavy burden " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of catholics have been disappointed by the pope swiss theologian hans kueng , speaking on german radio rbb , accused benedict of being out of touch with his " kingdom " .
in kueng 's words , " the pope has no critical people around him . "
in light of this wave of reactions , the vatican has sought to quell the outrage .
during his weekly general audience on wednesday , benedict said the memory of the holocaust can not be cancelled through any form of denial .
the german-born pontiff also recalled his own past pilgrimages to the former nazi death camp of auschwitz .
" the images i collected during my numerous visits to auschwitz bore witness to the innocent victims of a racial hatred , " he said .
questioning the church ?
spiegel reported that some german catholics are questioning their adherence to the church .
helmut reinhard , a catholic living in the city of munich , lost 15 members of his family in auschwitz-birkenau , " all of them gypsies , " he told the magazine , " and all of them catholic . "
as a result of the pope 's pardon , reinhard 's brother markus had left the catholic church , together with his wife and her four sisters , on holocaust memorial day .
now he too has had enough , he told the magazine , and was renouncing his membership .

" the images i collected during my numerous visits to auschwitz bore witness to the innocent victims of a racial hatred , " he said .
questioning the church ?

helmut reinhard , a catholic living in the city of munich , lost 15 members of his family in auschwitz-birkenau , " all of them gypsies , " he told the magazine , " and all of them catholic . "
as a result of the pope 's pardon , reinhard 's brother markus had left the catholic church , together with his wife and her four sisters , on holocaust memorial day .

"
pope benedict xvi 's pardon of williamson , along with three other ultra-conservative bishops , has threatened the vatican 's relationship with jewish leaders and led to an outburst of criticism within the catholic church .
two weeks ago , in an interview with swedish state television , williamson said " historical evidence is hugely against 6 million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on jan .

in light of the pope 's german nationality , knobloch said she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . "
former chief rabbi israel meir lau , a survivor of buchenwald concentration camp , was quoted in spiegel asking , " how can such a liar be granted the protection and pardon of the leader of the catholic church ? "
german catholics protest german catholics have also reacted strongly to benedict 's decision .
in the city of muenster , where the pope once taught as a professor of theology , almost the entire catholic faculty signed a letter of protest , while theologians in the city of tuebingen described the decision as a " heavy burden " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of catholics have been disappointed by the pope swiss theologian hans kueng , speaking on german radio rbb , accused benedict of being out of touch with his " kingdom " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 31.01.2009 mixture of support and skepticism for obama in davos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama entered office with the promise of change .
some say its time for action despite the absence of cabinet members of the new us administration at the world economic forum , president obama is all the talk in davos .
can he reverse the ailing economy and restore america 's role in the world ? predictions of the imminent decline of the us as the major global power are nothing new .
back in 1988 , the late samuel huntington wrote a long essay about what he described as the fifth way of declinism since the 1950 's .
then , as now , economic and military factors were the major factors why many perceived the us to be on a slow but steady downward spiral as a great power .
however , there are many stark differences between 1998 and 2008 and 2009 that make it difficult to compare the periods , for example , the demise of the soviet union and the rise of islamic extremism , and most importantly , globalization .
us a constant topic in davos with the world in the midst of the biggest economic crisis since the great depression , what are the chances that the us under its new president barack obama can master the situation , and how will the us and the world be changed through this crisis ?
this is a question that is being discussed almost incessantly at the world economic forum in davos .
of course , the subject is not addressed as such , but it is the theme that runs as an undercurrent through almost any small talk or debate .
and while all the latest economic indicators signal more doom and gloom for the world 's biggest economy - house prices decline by almost 20 percent , durable goods orders decline for the fifth month in a row , unemployment skyrocketing - the amount of respect and hope business and government leaders from around the world place on president barack obama to turn the u.s. economy around and restore the country 's stature in the world is astonishing .
" i am a huge fan of barack obama , " says klaas kersting , ceo of gameforge ag , a german online gaming start-up .
" i think he had a really good start of turning things around to bring the u.s. out of its moral crisis . "
african roots a factor for obama 's popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa , and kenya in particular , have high hopes for obama arthur mutambara , deputy prime minister of zimbabwe for the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , cites a different reason why he believes president obama can bring about the change he promised during his election campaign : " being of african extraction , being a son of a kenyan , yes , he has the potential to do it .
what it requires is the confidence and the courage to do so . "
while president obama won international praise for some of the early decisions he made right after taking office , linda lorimer , vice president of yale university , makes a different argument : " i think the steps they took before the inauguration are even more important than what they have done in the first days of the administration , which is have a sense of prospect and promise .
i think those of us here who are in business or academia know that leadership today is about teamwork .
america needs to assert its leadership by showing it is part of the team of leading countries in the world and no longer is a go-it-alone kind of enterprise . "
listen , do n't patronise the sentiment expressed by lorimer that the us should again engage and cooperate with other nations is also common theme in davos .
" barack obama must make sure that on africa he listens to africans and not to come to africa and patronise africa , " says zimbabwe 's deputy prime minister mutambara .
" we in africa know what is good for ourselves and americans and the international community must listen to us not the other way around . "
even iran 's foreign minister said here in davos that his country was ready to respond if america 's policy change was genuine .
while barack obama and his administration appear to have plenty of goodwill , trust and support from around the world , the question is whether that is enough .
according to all major indicators , the economic situation in the us looks so grim that a quick way out of the misery seems all but impossible . hard struggle ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and his team face huge challenges however , even a self-declared obama fan like gameforge ceo kersting turns pessimistic when being asked about a prediction whether the new administration can reverse the downward trend .
" the economic challenges are dramatic .
the us economy is significantly suffering - finance , automotive and all the suppliers for that matter .
it is really a very big challenge and countries like china or india do n't sleep ; they grow in these times of crisis .
they grow slowly , but they still grow , so i think it is going to be a hard struggle for obama to turn this around . "
at this point , no one here in davos or anywhere else for that matter appears to know how and when america 's economy will come out of the crisis .
so what does that mean for people around the world who are waiting for president obama to fulfill his promise to bring change to the world ? " we ca n't possibly expect one person to solve all the ills that all of us are looking at , " says yale vice president lorimer and adds : " we have to hope that his very able team reaching out to the very able leadership around the world will find the right course of action .

munich appeared superhuman in a 5-1 cup rout on tuesday at vfb stuttgart , but all their ambitions froze on a cold friday when they were beaten 1-0 by hamburg in the bundesliga restart .
mladen petric 's winner shortly before halftime made sure that hamburg and not munich moved to the top of the standings -lrb- at least until later saturday -rrb- to the delight of the 57,000-strong crowd .
instead of starting a planned winning streak to take the league by storm munich 's inconsistency prevailed in their third season defeat .
" everyone believed that no one could stop them , but then came hamburg , " said the bild daily on saturday .
" petric punishes stupid bayern .
my god , what chances did the record champions waste last night . "
bayern 's expensive stars out of sorts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni had a frustrating time in front of goal friday the reigning champions munich were lethargic in the first half and then unable to find the net , with luca toni even missing from point blank range .
bayern complained that toni 's first half goal should have not been disallowed for an alleged push of bastian reinhardt .
but bayern were also lucky when petric and piotr trochowski were denied by the post .
" we are angry and disappointed because we go home empty-handed .
we wasted too many chances , " said munich coach juergen klinsmann .
chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said : " maybe we thought after the good game -lrb- in stuttgart -rrb- that we would only require a half-hearted effort .
but you ca n't afford that against any team , and definitely not against hamburg . "
while toni was the man to blame up front it took french star franck ribery a long time to show his class as well .
ribery was accused of arrogance when he chipped a penalty right into the arms of goalkeeper jens lehmann in the cup match and on friday former munich great mehmet scholl , speaking on ard television , bluntly told the frenchman to get his own act together instead of calling for the signing of new players .
" he should n't forget where he was two years ago .
he was playing in the middle of nowhere at marseille , " said scholl .

president barack obama stands for change , but one white house practice endures : appointing non-career diplomats to plum postings abroad . within his first two days in office , president barack obama named richard holbrooke and george mitchell as special envoys to the world 's hot spots and the senate unanimously confirmed susan rice as us ambassador to the united nations .
now obama will need to fill the top diplomatic posts in prestigious world capitals such as london , paris , moscow and tokyo as well as the sunny caribbean .
although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .
“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .
and now that caroline kennedy , an early obama supporter , has withdrawn from the new york senate race , the british national newspapers are even speculating that jfk 's daughter could follow the steps of her grandfather joseph p. kennedy as us ambassador in london . holbrooke served in newly reunified germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy 's grandfather was us ambassador to britain germany too has had its share of distinguished us ambassadors , who have been heavy hitters in foreign policy arena : walter stoessel had been us ambassador to the soviet union and interim secretary of state in 1982 ; vernon walters , a former un ambassador and deputy cia chief , was renowned for his linguistic prowess ; john kornblum , a career diplomat , had played a key role in the east-west détente that led to the end of the cold war , and richard holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan .
such an illustrious precedent has made the last two bush appointees — dan coats , an indiana senator and william timken , an ohio industrialist , both who speak no german , look somewhat pale in comparison .
joerg duppler , berlin director of the atlantic treaty association , who knows timken , feels that us-german ties are so close that who the american ambassador is has little impact on bilateral relations anyway .
“ timken did his job well .
he represented his president .
his job was n't to be popular with germans , ” said duppler . the devil who wears prada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wintour was the inspiration behind " devil wears prada " one of europe 's most coveted posts is paris , where two recent american ambassadors were hugely popular with the french elite . in a country where benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson once served , british-born pamela churchill harriman was long on pedigree , but short on experience .
linked by marriage to some of the most powerful men of the 20th century , harriman , a big fundraiser for the democratic party , had served during former president bill clinton 's first term .
her successor was felix rohatyn , the lazard freres investment banker , who had rescued new york city from bankruptcy in the 1970s .
“ they could n't have been more different , but were each very effective in their own way .
she was the socialite star ; he was the business intellectual star .
then there was arthur hartman , that rare career diplomat , who was a true professional .
the rest you do n't remember , " said ifri 's moisi . rumor has it that another american with a british accent could become obama 's ambassador to france .
fashion icon anna wintour , the editor of vogue magazine , hosted fundraisers for obama and got some big names behind his campaign .
moisi was amused by the thought that wintour , who reportedly inspired the chick lit novel " the devil wears prada " could be up for paris .
" why not ?
that would be fun .

although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .
“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .
and now that caroline kennedy , an early obama supporter , has withdrawn from the new york senate race , the british national newspapers are even speculating that jfk 's daughter could follow the steps of her grandfather joseph p. kennedy as us ambassador in london . holbrooke served in newly reunified germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy 's grandfather was us ambassador to britain germany too has had its share of distinguished us ambassadors , who have been heavy hitters in foreign policy arena : walter stoessel had been us ambassador to the soviet union and interim secretary of state in 1982 ; vernon walters , a former un ambassador and deputy cia chief , was renowned for his linguistic prowess ; john kornblum , a career diplomat , had played a key role in the east-west détente that led to the end of the cold war , and richard holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan .

president barack obama stands for change , but one white house practice endures : appointing non-career diplomats to plum postings abroad . within his first two days in office , president barack obama named richard holbrooke and george mitchell as special envoys to the world 's hot spots and the senate unanimously confirmed susan rice as us ambassador to the united nations .
now obama will need to fill the top diplomatic posts in prestigious world capitals such as london , paris , moscow and tokyo as well as the sunny caribbean .
although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .
“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .
and now that caroline kennedy , an early obama supporter , has withdrawn from the new york senate race , the british national newspapers are even speculating that jfk 's daughter could follow the steps of her grandfather joseph p. kennedy as us ambassador in london . holbrooke served in newly reunified germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy 's grandfather was us ambassador to britain germany too has had its share of distinguished us ambassadors , who have been heavy hitters in foreign policy arena : walter stoessel had been us ambassador to the soviet union and interim secretary of state in 1982 ; vernon walters , a former un ambassador and deputy cia chief , was renowned for his linguistic prowess ; john kornblum , a career diplomat , had played a key role in the east-west détente that led to the end of the cold war , and richard holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan .
such an illustrious precedent has made the last two bush appointees — dan coats , an indiana senator and william timken , an ohio industrialist , both who speak no german , look somewhat pale in comparison .
joerg duppler , berlin director of the atlantic treaty association , who knows timken , feels that us-german ties are so close that who the american ambassador is has little impact on bilateral relations anyway .
“ timken did his job well .
he represented his president .
his job was n't to be popular with germans , ” said duppler . the devil who wears prada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wintour was the inspiration behind " devil wears prada " one of europe 's most coveted posts is paris , where two recent american ambassadors were hugely popular with the french elite . in a country where benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson once served , british-born pamela churchill harriman was long on pedigree , but short on experience .
linked by marriage to some of the most powerful men of the 20th century , harriman , a big fundraiser for the democratic party , had served during former president bill clinton 's first term .
her successor was felix rohatyn , the lazard freres investment banker , who had rescued new york city from bankruptcy in the 1970s .
“ they could n't have been more different , but were each very effective in their own way .
she was the socialite star ; he was the business intellectual star .

what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .
and now that caroline kennedy , an early obama supporter , has withdrawn from the new york senate race , the british national newspapers are even speculating that jfk 's daughter could follow the steps of her grandfather joseph p. kennedy as us ambassador in london . holbrooke served in newly reunified germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy 's grandfather was us ambassador to britain germany too has had its share of distinguished us ambassadors , who have been heavy hitters in foreign policy arena : walter stoessel had been us ambassador to the soviet union and interim secretary of state in 1982 ; vernon walters , a former un ambassador and deputy cia chief , was renowned for his linguistic prowess ; john kornblum , a career diplomat , had played a key role in the east-west détente that led to the end of the cold war , and richard holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan .
such an illustrious precedent has made the last two bush appointees — dan coats , an indiana senator and william timken , an ohio industrialist , both who speak no german , look somewhat pale in comparison .
joerg duppler , berlin director of the atlantic treaty association , who knows timken , feels that us-german ties are so close that who the american ambassador is has little impact on bilateral relations anyway .
“ timken did his job well .
he represented his president .
his job was n't to be popular with germans , ” said duppler . the devil who wears prada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wintour was the inspiration behind " devil wears prada " one of europe 's most coveted posts is paris , where two recent american ambassadors were hugely popular with the french elite . in a country where benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson once served , british-born pamela churchill harriman was long on pedigree , but short on experience .
linked by marriage to some of the most powerful men of the 20th century , harriman , a big fundraiser for the democratic party , had served during former president bill clinton 's first term .
her successor was felix rohatyn , the lazard freres investment banker , who had rescued new york city from bankruptcy in the 1970s .
“ they could n't have been more different , but were each very effective in their own way .
she was the socialite star ; he was the business intellectual star .
then there was arthur hartman , that rare career diplomat , who was a true professional .
the rest you do n't remember , " said ifri 's moisi . rumor has it that another american with a british accent could become obama 's ambassador to france .
fashion icon anna wintour , the editor of vogue magazine , hosted fundraisers for obama and got some big names behind his campaign .
moisi was amused by the thought that wintour , who reportedly inspired the chick lit novel " the devil wears prada " could be up for paris .
" why not ?
that would be fun .

30 . piebalgs spoke of unity after german chancellor angela merkel asked the 27-member bloc to support the nord stream pipeline , which would bring russian natural gas under the baltic sea directly to germany . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country chairs the eu until june 30 , said tuesday that nord stream , as a pipeline deepening the eu 's reliance on russian gas , was " a direct threat to the nabucco project " that would skip russia as a supplier . speaking to reporters at an energy security conference in the northeastern czech city of ostrava , piebalgs said that the eu has backed nord stream as " one of the alternative routes . " " there is an agreement on this pipeline .
it is not controversial , " piebalgs said , adding that germany also supports nabucco as germany 's gas firm rwe is a member of its consortium . " the difference of opinion is not -lrb- as -rrb- big as people feel .
the eu is rather united on this pipeline policy , " he told reporters . topolanek , also present at the energy meeting , declined to comment on merkel 's letter . poland , baltic states biggest opponents poland and the baltic states have been the chief opponents of the nord stream pipeline , which bypasses them . piebalgs said that while poland would prefer other routes , warsaw was " not hostile " to the russian-german line .
" nobody says we do not need additional gas supplies to germany or the netherlands , " he said . playing down topolanek 's previous statements , czech vice-premier for european affairs alexandr vondra said that europe 's growing demand for gas would make use of both pipelines . the nord stream and nabucco pipelines , which would bring gas from the caspian via turkey , " are not in competition , " he said . the european commission on wednesday proposed 250 million euros for nabucco but the eight-billion-euro project faces hurdles despite the backing . the eu is yet to strike a transit deal with turkey and competes for nabucco 's supply in the caspian with russia , which offered central asian countries market-level prices . " our chance is that each and every producer also looks for diversification , " piebalgs said . the eu backs nabucco over a south stream pipeline that would carry russian gas to italy under the black sea and via greece . " we take note of it but definitely nabucco is most important for us because it brings not only new source ... but it also brings a new route , " the commissioner said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in december , representatives of most countries will gather in copenhagen , denmark and attempt to knock out a new climate deal , but some environmentalists have expressed concern that not enough will be done before then to enable the nations to reach an agreement .
" we have to get it right in copenhagen , there is no second chance here , " said yvo de boer , head of the un 's framework convention on climate change .
" we must decide to put a price on carbon , " said al gore , the former us vice president , adding that president barack obama would play a positive role in combating climate change .
" he is pushing hard for dramatic and bold moves in the right direction , " said gore , noting that the house of representatives had passed a stimulus bill , " the largest component of which is a green stimulus . "

in germany 's general election set for september 27 , the country 's troop presence in afghanistan , opposed by the majority of german citizens , is likely to be high on the agenda .
german chancellor angela merkel , presiding over a coalition government between her conservative cdu party and the spd on the left , has been instrumental in committing troops to the nato mission in afghanistan .
however the country 's foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , who is the spd 's election candidate , is critical of further troop deployment .
president of the federal police agency -lrb- bka -rrb- joerg ziercke warned that terrorists could attempt to influence the election outcome , similar to the madrid train bomb-attacks ahead of the spanish elections in 2004 .
" we are seeing clear parallels to the situation in spain , " zierke said in an interview with weekly news magazine focus .
parallels with spanish attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain suffered europe 's worst terror attack in 2004 ahead of spain 's 2004 elections , attacks on madrid 's commuter trains , in which 191 people died , achieved their aim of bringing about a change of government and a withdrawal of spanish troops from the us-led coalition in iraq .
bka-chief zierke said that radical converts to islam of german origin were especially dangerous .
" they know the german infrastructure , are socially integrated and hardly stand out because of their appearance . "
in the past weeks at least two videos have surfaced in which threats have been issued in german against countries with a military presence in afghanistan .
one video showed six masked men speaking in several languages , one of which was german , according to the german television channel ard .
" this year , we 've got a few surprise parcels for the occupying powers , since the allies of the occupying powers must always expect our attacks , " the german speaker said .
broadcasts carry threats to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has become increasingly referred to in islamist videos in an earlier video , a man identified as a moroccan-born german national demanded that germany withdraw its troops serving with nato in afghanistan .
in light of these internet postings , fromm said , " the most recent video messages clearly show that germany and german interests abroad are under threat . "
the intelligence chief said the videos show , " that attacks against our country are being prepared . "
at present , around 3000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan , as part of the country 's nato-led international security assistance force .
their role is restricted to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and they are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany 's general election set for september 27 , the country 's troop presence in afghanistan , opposed by the majority of german citizens , is likely to be high on the agenda .
german chancellor angela merkel , presiding over a coalition government between her conservative cdu party and the spd on the left , has been instrumental in committing troops to the nato mission in afghanistan .
however the country 's foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , who is the spd 's election candidate , is critical of further troop deployment .
president of the federal police agency -lrb- bka -rrb- joerg ziercke warned that terrorists could attempt to influence the election outcome , similar to the madrid train bomb-attacks ahead of the spanish elections in 2004 .
" we are seeing clear parallels to the situation in spain , " zierke said in an interview with weekly news magazine focus .
parallels with spanish attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain suffered europe 's worst terror attack in 2004 ahead of spain 's 2004 elections , attacks on madrid 's commuter trains , in which 191 people died , achieved their aim of bringing about a change of government and a withdrawal of spanish troops from the us-led coalition in iraq .
bka-chief zierke said that radical converts to islam of german origin were especially dangerous .
" they know the german infrastructure , are socially integrated and hardly stand out because of their appearance . "
in the past weeks at least two videos have surfaced in which threats have been issued in german against countries with a military presence in afghanistan .
one video showed six masked men speaking in several languages , one of which was german , according to the german television channel ard .
" this year , we 've got a few surprise parcels for the occupying powers , since the allies of the occupying powers must always expect our attacks , " the german speaker said .
broadcasts carry threats to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has become increasingly referred to in islamist videos in an earlier video , a man identified as a moroccan-born german national demanded that germany withdraw its troops serving with nato in afghanistan .
in light of these internet postings , fromm said , " the most recent video messages clearly show that germany and german interests abroad are under threat . "
the intelligence chief said the videos show , " that attacks against our country are being prepared . "
at present , around 3000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan , as part of the country 's nato-led international security assistance force .
their role is restricted to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and they are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the council said that foreign guest professors coming to germany to teach or to join research institutes were " under the impression they do not need to learn german , because english will do . "
this was because a knowledge of german was not necessary in order to be able to communicate in universities and non-university research establishments with german colleagues .

the council admitted its concern over the future of the language , saying that the loss of scientific german could lead to a loss at scientific thinking , because " science thinking is connected to language and culture . "
the fear was , it added , that german as an international scientific language could suffer in the long term .
" upholding the scientific german language has nothing to do with protectionism or nationalism , " olaf zimmermann , the council secretary , said .

in science today , only one percent of the papers published are in german , the council said .
an increasing number of foreign academics coming to germany for research or conference purposes add to the pressure on german scientists to present and work in english , as many visitors arrive with very basic or no german skills .
the council said that foreign guest professors coming to germany to teach or to join research institutes were " under the impression they do not need to learn german , because english will do . "
this was because a knowledge of german was not necessary in order to be able to communicate in universities and non-university research establishments with german colleagues .
most german academics prefer to publish in english as well as making it easier to speak with foreign colleagues , german academics also prefered english over their native language when it comes to publishing their work , the council said .
it therefore called for the increased promotion of scientific publications in german .
the council admitted its concern over the future of the language , saying that the loss of scientific german could lead to a loss at scientific thinking , because " science thinking is connected to language and culture . "
the fear was , it added , that german as an international scientific language could suffer in the long term .
" upholding the scientific german language has nothing to do with protectionism or nationalism , " olaf zimmermann , the council secretary , said .
" on the contrary , it concerns the security of cultural diversity and cultural self-sufficiency . "
zimmermann called for more funding of the arts , where german was still a significant language .
he demanded that all academic conferences held in germany be conducted in both english and german , not english alone .

munich appeared superhuman in a 5-1 cup rout on tuesday at vfb stuttgart , but all their ambitions froze on a cold friday when they were beaten 1-0 by hamburg in the bundesliga restart .
mladen petric 's winner shortly before halftime made sure that hamburg and not munich moved to the top of the standings -lrb- at least until later saturday -rrb- to the delight of the 57,000-strong crowd .
instead of starting a planned winning streak to take the league by storm munich 's inconsistency prevailed in their third season defeat .

" we are angry and disappointed because we go home empty-handed .
we wasted too many chances , " said munich coach juergen klinsmann .
chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said : " maybe we thought after the good game -lrb- in stuttgart -rrb- that we would only require a half-hearted effort .
but you ca n't afford that against any team , and definitely not against hamburg . "
while toni was the man to blame up front it took french star franck ribery a long time to show his class as well .
ribery was accused of arrogance when he chipped a penalty right into the arms of goalkeeper jens lehmann in the cup match and on friday former munich great mehmet scholl , speaking on ard television , bluntly told the frenchman to get his own act together instead of calling for the signing of new players .

bayern complained that toni 's first half goal should have not been disallowed for an alleged push of bastian reinhardt .
but bayern were also lucky when petric and piotr trochowski were denied by the post .
" we are angry and disappointed because we go home empty-handed .
we wasted too many chances , " said munich coach juergen klinsmann .
chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said : " maybe we thought after the good game -lrb- in stuttgart -rrb- that we would only require a half-hearted effort .
but you ca n't afford that against any team , and definitely not against hamburg . "
while toni was the man to blame up front it took french star franck ribery a long time to show his class as well .
ribery was accused of arrogance when he chipped a penalty right into the arms of goalkeeper jens lehmann in the cup match and on friday former munich great mehmet scholl , speaking on ard television , bluntly told the frenchman to get his own act together instead of calling for the signing of new players .
" he should n't forget where he was two years ago .
he was playing in the middle of nowhere at marseille , " said scholl .
title race blown open by munich loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery needs to rediscover his form and desire in the run-in nothing is lost for munich in a close title race which also features hibernation period leaders tsg hoffenheim , bayer leverkusen and possibly hertha berlin .
but failing to impress the rivals early on will hurt the success-hungry top club .
their inability to find the net even generated another title rival in hamburg , whose coach martin jol delighted in an " incredible game . "
" hamburg are in the title race since tonight , " said rummenigge . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
pope benedict xvi 's pardon of williamson , along with three other ultra-conservative bishops , has threatened the vatican 's relationship with jewish leaders and led to an outburst of criticism within the catholic church .
two weeks ago , in an interview with swedish state television , williamson said " historical evidence is hugely against 6 million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on jan .

heavy burden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson has apologized to the pope for " distress " caused by his " imprudent " comments the president of germany 's jewish central committee , charlotte knobloch , made it clear on friday that the vatican 's decision weighed heavily on the relationship between jews and catholics .
in light of the pope 's german nationality , knobloch said she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . "
former chief rabbi israel meir lau , a survivor of buchenwald concentration camp , was quoted in spiegel asking , " how can such a liar be granted the protection and pardon of the leader of the catholic church ? "
german catholics protest german catholics have also reacted strongly to benedict 's decision .
in the city of muenster , where the pope once taught as a professor of theology , almost the entire catholic faculty signed a letter of protest , while theologians in the city of tuebingen described the decision as a " heavy burden " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of catholics have been disappointed by the pope swiss theologian hans kueng , speaking on german radio rbb , accused benedict of being out of touch with his " kingdom " .
in kueng 's words , " the pope has no critical people around him . "
in light of this wave of reactions , the vatican has sought to quell the outrage .
during his weekly general audience on wednesday , benedict said the memory of the holocaust can not be cancelled through any form of denial .
the german-born pontiff also recalled his own past pilgrimages to the former nazi death camp of auschwitz .
" the images i collected during my numerous visits to auschwitz bore witness to the innocent victims of a racial hatred , " he said .
questioning the church ?
spiegel reported that some german catholics are questioning their adherence to the church .
helmut reinhard , a catholic living in the city of munich , lost 15 members of his family in auschwitz-birkenau , " all of them gypsies , " he told the magazine , " and all of them catholic . "
as a result of the pope 's pardon , reinhard 's brother markus had left the catholic church , together with his wife and her four sisters , on holocaust memorial day .
now he too has had enough , he told the magazine , and was renouncing his membership .
german public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his remarks .

two weeks ago , in an interview with swedish state television , williamson said " historical evidence is hugely against 6 million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on jan .
27 .
heavy burden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson has apologized to the pope for " distress " caused by his " imprudent " comments the president of germany 's jewish central committee , charlotte knobloch , made it clear on friday that the vatican 's decision weighed heavily on the relationship between jews and catholics .
in light of the pope 's german nationality , knobloch said she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . "
former chief rabbi israel meir lau , a survivor of buchenwald concentration camp , was quoted in spiegel asking , " how can such a liar be granted the protection and pardon of the leader of the catholic church ? "
german catholics protest german catholics have also reacted strongly to benedict 's decision .
in the city of muenster , where the pope once taught as a professor of theology , almost the entire catholic faculty signed a letter of protest , while theologians in the city of tuebingen described the decision as a " heavy burden " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of catholics have been disappointed by the pope swiss theologian hans kueng , speaking on german radio rbb , accused benedict of being out of touch with his " kingdom " .
in kueng 's words , " the pope has no critical people around him . "
in light of this wave of reactions , the vatican has sought to quell the outrage .
during his weekly general audience on wednesday , benedict said the memory of the holocaust can not be cancelled through any form of denial .
the german-born pontiff also recalled his own past pilgrimages to the former nazi death camp of auschwitz .
" the images i collected during my numerous visits to auschwitz bore witness to the innocent victims of a racial hatred , " he said .
questioning the church ?
spiegel reported that some german catholics are questioning their adherence to the church .
helmut reinhard , a catholic living in the city of munich , lost 15 members of his family in auschwitz-birkenau , " all of them gypsies , " he told the magazine , " and all of them catholic . "
as a result of the pope 's pardon , reinhard 's brother markus had left the catholic church , together with his wife and her four sisters , on holocaust memorial day .
now he too has had enough , he told the magazine , and was renouncing his membership .
german public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his remarks .

some of the visitors leave behind their most intimate thoughts , wishes and prayers . " thank you for giving me the strength to kick my habit , " reads one anonymous comment .
another is from ollie : " i 'd been driving back and forth past this spot for nearly half a year before i decided to stop and seek out your house . " the protestant church of st. martin in waldlaubersheim is one of 33 such churches located alongside germany 's famous autobahns , an institution which celebrated 50 years in a ceremony in a church on the a8 in adelsried in 2008 .
more than 1 million people visit them every year . these houses of worship invite people to seek " relaxation , refuge and contemplation . "
the churches are " rest stops for the soul , " according to the website autobahnkirche.info maintained by the bruderhilfe pastoral organization in kassel . highway chapels curb road rage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stopping at an autobahn church may ease traffic-jam tension " drivers who stop at an autobahn church tend to continue their journey in a more relaxed manner and are more considerate to other road-users which goes to show that a visit contributes to road safety , " the custodians of the church write . yet what qualifies a church to be an autobahn chapel ?
" it must be close to a motorway exit and stay open the whole day , " said birgit krause who works for the bruderhilfe . although the autobahn churches maintain no firm links with each other , their pastors do meet once a year to exchange ideas .
most of the chapels are protestant , but the doors are open to worshippers of all confessions , said krause . many of the churches are remote from rural communities , yet damage or vandalism is no more of a problem than it is elsewhere .
" people are coming in and out the whole time which acts as a check on anti-social behavior . " until 1991 , st. martin 's church was a house of worship for people from waldlaubersheim until a local vineyard owner came up with the idea of turning it into an autobahn chapel . drivers just want simple rituals " he was on the road a lot in his car delivering wine and knew how stressful driving can be , " explained pastor joachim deserno .
" in the beginning , we racked our brains over all the things we would need to provide for visitors until it suddenly occurred to us - they do n't actually want much . " the guestbook is an important feature along with a leaflet containing a blessing for each visitor .
drivers can also write down their prayers , wishes and concerns on slips of paper and attach them to a large wooden crucifix .
candles can be lit in a corner next to the altar while to the rear of the transept , below the handsome old organ , stands a table with toys and books for children . bildunterschrift : autobahn churches are especially popular with the elderly " that has come in use for local services too , " said deserno . experts from the catholic university of applied sciences in freiburg found in a survey that a typical visitor to an autobahn chapel is at least 50 years old , with men churchgoers outnumbering women . a study of 400 questionnaires also revealed that two-thirds of visitors come in from the road not just to rest but to pray , light a candle or take part in a religious service .
the majority of visitors were catholics . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany 's general election set for september 27 , the country 's troop presence in afghanistan , opposed by the majority of german citizens , is likely to be high on the agenda .
german chancellor angela merkel , presiding over a coalition government between her conservative cdu party and the spd on the left , has been instrumental in committing troops to the nato mission in afghanistan .
however the country 's foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , who is the spd 's election candidate , is critical of further troop deployment .
president of the federal police agency -lrb- bka -rrb- joerg ziercke warned that terrorists could attempt to influence the election outcome , similar to the madrid train bomb-attacks ahead of the spanish elections in 2004 .
" we are seeing clear parallels to the situation in spain , " zierke said in an interview with weekly news magazine focus .
parallels with spanish attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain suffered europe 's worst terror attack in 2004 ahead of spain 's 2004 elections , attacks on madrid 's commuter trains , in which 191 people died , achieved their aim of bringing about a change of government and a withdrawal of spanish troops from the us-led coalition in iraq .
bka-chief zierke said that radical converts to islam of german origin were especially dangerous .
" they know the german infrastructure , are socially integrated and hardly stand out because of their appearance . "
in the past weeks at least two videos have surfaced in which threats have been issued in german against countries with a military presence in afghanistan .
one video showed six masked men speaking in several languages , one of which was german , according to the german television channel ard .
" this year , we 've got a few surprise parcels for the occupying powers , since the allies of the occupying powers must always expect our attacks , " the german speaker said .
broadcasts carry threats to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has become increasingly referred to in islamist videos in an earlier video , a man identified as a moroccan-born german national demanded that germany withdraw its troops serving with nato in afghanistan .
in light of these internet postings , fromm said , " the most recent video messages clearly show that germany and german interests abroad are under threat . "
the intelligence chief said the videos show , " that attacks against our country are being prepared . "
at present , around 3000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan , as part of the country 's nato-led international security assistance force .
their role is restricted to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and they are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 31.01.2009 mixture of support and skepticism for obama in davos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama entered office with the promise of change .
some say its time for action despite the absence of cabinet members of the new us administration at the world economic forum , president obama is all the talk in davos .
can he reverse the ailing economy and restore america 's role in the world ? predictions of the imminent decline of the us as the major global power are nothing new .
back in 1988 , the late samuel huntington wrote a long essay about what he described as the fifth way of declinism since the 1950 's .
then , as now , economic and military factors were the major factors why many perceived the us to be on a slow but steady downward spiral as a great power .
however , there are many stark differences between 1998 and 2008 and 2009 that make it difficult to compare the periods , for example , the demise of the soviet union and the rise of islamic extremism , and most importantly , globalization .
us a constant topic in davos with the world in the midst of the biggest economic crisis since the great depression , what are the chances that the us under its new president barack obama can master the situation , and how will the us and the world be changed through this crisis ?
this is a question that is being discussed almost incessantly at the world economic forum in davos .
of course , the subject is not addressed as such , but it is the theme that runs as an undercurrent through almost any small talk or debate .
and while all the latest economic indicators signal more doom and gloom for the world 's biggest economy - house prices decline by almost 20 percent , durable goods orders decline for the fifth month in a row , unemployment skyrocketing - the amount of respect and hope business and government leaders from around the world place on president barack obama to turn the u.s. economy around and restore the country 's stature in the world is astonishing .
" i am a huge fan of barack obama , " says klaas kersting , ceo of gameforge ag , a german online gaming start-up .
" i think he had a really good start of turning things around to bring the u.s. out of its moral crisis . "
african roots a factor for obama 's popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa , and kenya in particular , have high hopes for obama arthur mutambara , deputy prime minister of zimbabwe for the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , cites a different reason why he believes president obama can bring about the change he promised during his election campaign : " being of african extraction , being a son of a kenyan , yes , he has the potential to do it .
what it requires is the confidence and the courage to do so . "
while president obama won international praise for some of the early decisions he made right after taking office , linda lorimer , vice president of yale university , makes a different argument : " i think the steps they took before the inauguration are even more important than what they have done in the first days of the administration , which is have a sense of prospect and promise .
i think those of us here who are in business or academia know that leadership today is about teamwork .
america needs to assert its leadership by showing it is part of the team of leading countries in the world and no longer is a go-it-alone kind of enterprise . "
listen , do n't patronise the sentiment expressed by lorimer that the us should again engage and cooperate with other nations is also common theme in davos .
" barack obama must make sure that on africa he listens to africans and not to come to africa and patronise africa , " says zimbabwe 's deputy prime minister mutambara .
" we in africa know what is good for ourselves and americans and the international community must listen to us not the other way around . "
even iran 's foreign minister said here in davos that his country was ready to respond if america 's policy change was genuine .
while barack obama and his administration appear to have plenty of goodwill , trust and support from around the world , the question is whether that is enough .
according to all major indicators , the economic situation in the us looks so grim that a quick way out of the misery seems all but impossible . hard struggle ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and his team face huge challenges however , even a self-declared obama fan like gameforge ceo kersting turns pessimistic when being asked about a prediction whether the new administration can reverse the downward trend .
" the economic challenges are dramatic .
the us economy is significantly suffering - finance , automotive and all the suppliers for that matter .
it is really a very big challenge and countries like china or india do n't sleep ; they grow in these times of crisis .
they grow slowly , but they still grow , so i think it is going to be a hard struggle for obama to turn this around . "
at this point , no one here in davos or anywhere else for that matter appears to know how and when america 's economy will come out of the crisis .
so what does that mean for people around the world who are waiting for president obama to fulfill his promise to bring change to the world ? " we ca n't possibly expect one person to solve all the ills that all of us are looking at , " says yale vice president lorimer and adds : " we have to hope that his very able team reaching out to the very able leadership around the world will find the right course of action .

some say its time for action despite the absence of cabinet members of the new us administration at the world economic forum , president obama is all the talk in davos .
can he reverse the ailing economy and restore america 's role in the world ? predictions of the imminent decline of the us as the major global power are nothing new .
back in 1988 , the late samuel huntington wrote a long essay about what he described as the fifth way of declinism since the 1950 's .
then , as now , economic and military factors were the major factors why many perceived the us to be on a slow but steady downward spiral as a great power .
however , there are many stark differences between 1998 and 2008 and 2009 that make it difficult to compare the periods , for example , the demise of the soviet union and the rise of islamic extremism , and most importantly , globalization .
us a constant topic in davos with the world in the midst of the biggest economic crisis since the great depression , what are the chances that the us under its new president barack obama can master the situation , and how will the us and the world be changed through this crisis ?
this is a question that is being discussed almost incessantly at the world economic forum in davos .
of course , the subject is not addressed as such , but it is the theme that runs as an undercurrent through almost any small talk or debate .
and while all the latest economic indicators signal more doom and gloom for the world 's biggest economy - house prices decline by almost 20 percent , durable goods orders decline for the fifth month in a row , unemployment skyrocketing - the amount of respect and hope business and government leaders from around the world place on president barack obama to turn the u.s. economy around and restore the country 's stature in the world is astonishing .
" i am a huge fan of barack obama , " says klaas kersting , ceo of gameforge ag , a german online gaming start-up .
" i think he had a really good start of turning things around to bring the u.s. out of its moral crisis . "

what it requires is the confidence and the courage to do so . "
while president obama won international praise for some of the early decisions he made right after taking office , linda lorimer , vice president of yale university , makes a different argument : " i think the steps they took before the inauguration are even more important than what they have done in the first days of the administration , which is have a sense of prospect and promise .
i think those of us here who are in business or academia know that leadership today is about teamwork .
america needs to assert its leadership by showing it is part of the team of leading countries in the world and no longer is a go-it-alone kind of enterprise . "
listen , do n't patronise the sentiment expressed by lorimer that the us should again engage and cooperate with other nations is also common theme in davos .
" barack obama must make sure that on africa he listens to africans and not to come to africa and patronise africa , " says zimbabwe 's deputy prime minister mutambara .
" we in africa know what is good for ourselves and americans and the international community must listen to us not the other way around . "
even iran 's foreign minister said here in davos that his country was ready to respond if america 's policy change was genuine .
while barack obama and his administration appear to have plenty of goodwill , trust and support from around the world , the question is whether that is enough .
according to all major indicators , the economic situation in the us looks so grim that a quick way out of the misery seems all but impossible . hard struggle ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and his team face huge challenges however , even a self-declared obama fan like gameforge ceo kersting turns pessimistic when being asked about a prediction whether the new administration can reverse the downward trend .

the us economy is significantly suffering - finance , automotive and all the suppliers for that matter .
it is really a very big challenge and countries like china or india do n't sleep ; they grow in these times of crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 31.01.2009 obama deliberates over picking us ambassadors for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us embassy in paris is one of the most sought-after posts caroline kennedy as us ambassador to britain ?
fashion icon anna wintour for paris ?
president barack obama stands for change , but one white house practice endures : appointing non-career diplomats to plum postings abroad . within his first two days in office , president barack obama named richard holbrooke and george mitchell as special envoys to the world 's hot spots and the senate unanimously confirmed susan rice as us ambassador to the united nations .
now obama will need to fill the top diplomatic posts in prestigious world capitals such as london , paris , moscow and tokyo as well as the sunny caribbean .
although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .
“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .

president barack obama stands for change , but one white house practice endures : appointing non-career diplomats to plum postings abroad . within his first two days in office , president barack obama named richard holbrooke and george mitchell as special envoys to the world 's hot spots and the senate unanimously confirmed susan rice as us ambassador to the united nations .
now obama will need to fill the top diplomatic posts in prestigious world capitals such as london , paris , moscow and tokyo as well as the sunny caribbean .
although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .
“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .

president barack obama stands for change , but one white house practice endures : appointing non-career diplomats to plum postings abroad . within his first two days in office , president barack obama named richard holbrooke and george mitchell as special envoys to the world 's hot spots and the senate unanimously confirmed susan rice as us ambassador to the united nations .
now obama will need to fill the top diplomatic posts in prestigious world capitals such as london , paris , moscow and tokyo as well as the sunny caribbean .
although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .

political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .

some say its time for action despite the absence of cabinet members of the new us administration at the world economic forum , president obama is all the talk in davos .
can he reverse the ailing economy and restore america 's role in the world ? predictions of the imminent decline of the us as the major global power are nothing new .
back in 1988 , the late samuel huntington wrote a long essay about what he described as the fifth way of declinism since the 1950 's .
then , as now , economic and military factors were the major factors why many perceived the us to be on a slow but steady downward spiral as a great power .
however , there are many stark differences between 1998 and 2008 and 2009 that make it difficult to compare the periods , for example , the demise of the soviet union and the rise of islamic extremism , and most importantly , globalization .
us a constant topic in davos with the world in the midst of the biggest economic crisis since the great depression , what are the chances that the us under its new president barack obama can master the situation , and how will the us and the world be changed through this crisis ?
this is a question that is being discussed almost incessantly at the world economic forum in davos .
of course , the subject is not addressed as such , but it is the theme that runs as an undercurrent through almost any small talk or debate .
and while all the latest economic indicators signal more doom and gloom for the world 's biggest economy - house prices decline by almost 20 percent , durable goods orders decline for the fifth month in a row , unemployment skyrocketing - the amount of respect and hope business and government leaders from around the world place on president barack obama to turn the u.s. economy around and restore the country 's stature in the world is astonishing .
" i am a huge fan of barack obama , " says klaas kersting , ceo of gameforge ag , a german online gaming start-up .
" i think he had a really good start of turning things around to bring the u.s. out of its moral crisis . "
african roots a factor for obama 's popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa , and kenya in particular , have high hopes for obama arthur mutambara , deputy prime minister of zimbabwe for the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , cites a different reason why he believes president obama can bring about the change he promised during his election campaign : " being of african extraction , being a son of a kenyan , yes , he has the potential to do it .
what it requires is the confidence and the courage to do so . "
while president obama won international praise for some of the early decisions he made right after taking office , linda lorimer , vice president of yale university , makes a different argument : " i think the steps they took before the inauguration are even more important than what they have done in the first days of the administration , which is have a sense of prospect and promise .
i think those of us here who are in business or academia know that leadership today is about teamwork .
america needs to assert its leadership by showing it is part of the team of leading countries in the world and no longer is a go-it-alone kind of enterprise . "
listen , do n't patronise the sentiment expressed by lorimer that the us should again engage and cooperate with other nations is also common theme in davos .
" barack obama must make sure that on africa he listens to africans and not to come to africa and patronise africa , " says zimbabwe 's deputy prime minister mutambara .
" we in africa know what is good for ourselves and americans and the international community must listen to us not the other way around . "
even iran 's foreign minister said here in davos that his country was ready to respond if america 's policy change was genuine .
while barack obama and his administration appear to have plenty of goodwill , trust and support from around the world , the question is whether that is enough .
according to all major indicators , the economic situation in the us looks so grim that a quick way out of the misery seems all but impossible . hard struggle ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and his team face huge challenges however , even a self-declared obama fan like gameforge ceo kersting turns pessimistic when being asked about a prediction whether the new administration can reverse the downward trend .
" the economic challenges are dramatic .
the us economy is significantly suffering - finance , automotive and all the suppliers for that matter .
it is really a very big challenge and countries like china or india do n't sleep ; they grow in these times of crisis .
they grow slowly , but they still grow , so i think it is going to be a hard struggle for obama to turn this around . "
at this point , no one here in davos or anywhere else for that matter appears to know how and when america 's economy will come out of the crisis .
so what does that mean for people around the world who are waiting for president obama to fulfill his promise to bring change to the world ? " we ca n't possibly expect one person to solve all the ills that all of us are looking at , " says yale vice president lorimer and adds : " we have to hope that his very able team reaching out to the very able leadership around the world will find the right course of action .

munich appeared superhuman in a 5-1 cup rout on tuesday at vfb stuttgart , but all their ambitions froze on a cold friday when they were beaten 1-0 by hamburg in the bundesliga restart .
mladen petric 's winner shortly before halftime made sure that hamburg and not munich moved to the top of the standings -lrb- at least until later saturday -rrb- to the delight of the 57,000-strong crowd .
instead of starting a planned winning streak to take the league by storm munich 's inconsistency prevailed in their third season defeat .
" everyone believed that no one could stop them , but then came hamburg , " said the bild daily on saturday .
" petric punishes stupid bayern .
my god , what chances did the record champions waste last night . "
bayern 's expensive stars out of sorts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni had a frustrating time in front of goal friday the reigning champions munich were lethargic in the first half and then unable to find the net , with luca toni even missing from point blank range .
bayern complained that toni 's first half goal should have not been disallowed for an alleged push of bastian reinhardt .
but bayern were also lucky when petric and piotr trochowski were denied by the post .
" we are angry and disappointed because we go home empty-handed .
we wasted too many chances , " said munich coach juergen klinsmann .
chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said : " maybe we thought after the good game -lrb- in stuttgart -rrb- that we would only require a half-hearted effort .

munich appeared superhuman in a 5-1 cup rout on tuesday at vfb stuttgart , but all their ambitions froze on a cold friday when they were beaten 1-0 by hamburg in the bundesliga restart .
mladen petric 's winner shortly before halftime made sure that hamburg and not munich moved to the top of the standings -lrb- at least until later saturday -rrb- to the delight of the 57,000-strong crowd .
instead of starting a planned winning streak to take the league by storm munich 's inconsistency prevailed in their third season defeat .
" everyone believed that no one could stop them , but then came hamburg , " said the bild daily on saturday .
" petric punishes stupid bayern .
my god , what chances did the record champions waste last night . "
bayern 's expensive stars out of sorts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni had a frustrating time in front of goal friday the reigning champions munich were lethargic in the first half and then unable to find the net , with luca toni even missing from point blank range .
bayern complained that toni 's first half goal should have not been disallowed for an alleged push of bastian reinhardt .
but bayern were also lucky when petric and piotr trochowski were denied by the post .
" we are angry and disappointed because we go home empty-handed .
we wasted too many chances , " said munich coach juergen klinsmann .
chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said : " maybe we thought after the good game -lrb- in stuttgart -rrb- that we would only require a half-hearted effort .

"
pope benedict xvi 's pardon of williamson , along with three other ultra-conservative bishops , has threatened the vatican 's relationship with jewish leaders and led to an outburst of criticism within the catholic church .
two weeks ago , in an interview with swedish state television , williamson said " historical evidence is hugely against 6 million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on jan .

heavy burden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson has apologized to the pope for " distress " caused by his " imprudent " comments the president of germany 's jewish central committee , charlotte knobloch , made it clear on friday that the vatican 's decision weighed heavily on the relationship between jews and catholics .
in light of the pope 's german nationality , knobloch said she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . "
former chief rabbi israel meir lau , a survivor of buchenwald concentration camp , was quoted in spiegel asking , " how can such a liar be granted the protection and pardon of the leader of the catholic church ? "
german catholics protest german catholics have also reacted strongly to benedict 's decision .
in the city of muenster , where the pope once taught as a professor of theology , almost the entire catholic faculty signed a letter of protest , while theologians in the city of tuebingen described the decision as a " heavy burden " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of catholics have been disappointed by the pope swiss theologian hans kueng , speaking on german radio rbb , accused benedict of being out of touch with his " kingdom " .
in kueng 's words , " the pope has no critical people around him . "
in light of this wave of reactions , the vatican has sought to quell the outrage .
during his weekly general audience on wednesday , benedict said the memory of the holocaust can not be cancelled through any form of denial .
the german-born pontiff also recalled his own past pilgrimages to the former nazi death camp of auschwitz .
" the images i collected during my numerous visits to auschwitz bore witness to the innocent victims of a racial hatred , " he said .
questioning the church ?
spiegel reported that some german catholics are questioning their adherence to the church .
helmut reinhard , a catholic living in the city of munich , lost 15 members of his family in auschwitz-birkenau , " all of them gypsies , " he told the magazine , " and all of them catholic . "
as a result of the pope 's pardon , reinhard 's brother markus had left the catholic church , together with his wife and her four sisters , on holocaust memorial day .
now he too has had enough , he told the magazine , and was renouncing his membership .

former chief rabbi israel meir lau , a survivor of buchenwald concentration camp , was quoted in spiegel asking , " how can such a liar be granted the protection and pardon of the leader of the catholic church ? "
german catholics protest german catholics have also reacted strongly to benedict 's decision .
in the city of muenster , where the pope once taught as a professor of theology , almost the entire catholic faculty signed a letter of protest , while theologians in the city of tuebingen described the decision as a " heavy burden " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of catholics have been disappointed by the pope swiss theologian hans kueng , speaking on german radio rbb , accused benedict of being out of touch with his " kingdom " .
in kueng 's words , " the pope has no critical people around him . "
in light of this wave of reactions , the vatican has sought to quell the outrage .
during his weekly general audience on wednesday , benedict said the memory of the holocaust can not be cancelled through any form of denial .
the german-born pontiff also recalled his own past pilgrimages to the former nazi death camp of auschwitz .
" the images i collected during my numerous visits to auschwitz bore witness to the innocent victims of a racial hatred , " he said .
questioning the church ?
spiegel reported that some german catholics are questioning their adherence to the church .
helmut reinhard , a catholic living in the city of munich , lost 15 members of his family in auschwitz-birkenau , " all of them gypsies , " he told the magazine , " and all of them catholic . "
as a result of the pope 's pardon , reinhard 's brother markus had left the catholic church , together with his wife and her four sisters , on holocaust memorial day .
now he too has had enough , he told the magazine , and was renouncing his membership .
german public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his remarks .

some of the visitors leave behind their most intimate thoughts , wishes and prayers . " thank you for giving me the strength to kick my habit , " reads one anonymous comment .
another is from ollie : " i 'd been driving back and forth past this spot for nearly half a year before i decided to stop and seek out your house . " the protestant church of st. martin in waldlaubersheim is one of 33 such churches located alongside germany 's famous autobahns , an institution which celebrated 50 years in a ceremony in a church on the a8 in adelsried in 2008 .
more than 1 million people visit them every year . these houses of worship invite people to seek " relaxation , refuge and contemplation . "
the churches are " rest stops for the soul , " according to the website autobahnkirche.info maintained by the bruderhilfe pastoral organization in kassel . highway chapels curb road rage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stopping at an autobahn church may ease traffic-jam tension " drivers who stop at an autobahn church tend to continue their journey in a more relaxed manner and are more considerate to other road-users which goes to show that a visit contributes to road safety , " the custodians of the church write . yet what qualifies a church to be an autobahn chapel ?
" it must be close to a motorway exit and stay open the whole day , " said birgit krause who works for the bruderhilfe . although the autobahn churches maintain no firm links with each other , their pastors do meet once a year to exchange ideas .
most of the chapels are protestant , but the doors are open to worshippers of all confessions , said krause . many of the churches are remote from rural communities , yet damage or vandalism is no more of a problem than it is elsewhere .
" people are coming in and out the whole time which acts as a check on anti-social behavior . " until 1991 , st. martin 's church was a house of worship for people from waldlaubersheim until a local vineyard owner came up with the idea of turning it into an autobahn chapel . drivers just want simple rituals " he was on the road a lot in his car delivering wine and knew how stressful driving can be , " explained pastor joachim deserno .
" in the beginning , we racked our brains over all the things we would need to provide for visitors until it suddenly occurred to us - they do n't actually want much . " the guestbook is an important feature along with a leaflet containing a blessing for each visitor .
drivers can also write down their prayers , wishes and concerns on slips of paper and attach them to a large wooden crucifix .
candles can be lit in a corner next to the altar while to the rear of the transept , below the handsome old organ , stands a table with toys and books for children . bildunterschrift : autobahn churches are especially popular with the elderly " that has come in use for local services too , " said deserno . experts from the catholic university of applied sciences in freiburg found in a survey that a typical visitor to an autobahn chapel is at least 50 years old , with men churchgoers outnumbering women . a study of 400 questionnaires also revealed that two-thirds of visitors come in from the road not just to rest but to pray , light a candle or take part in a religious service .
the majority of visitors were catholics . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fashion icon anna wintour for paris ?
president barack obama stands for change , but one white house practice endures : appointing non-career diplomats to plum postings abroad . within his first two days in office , president barack obama named richard holbrooke and george mitchell as special envoys to the world 's hot spots and the senate unanimously confirmed susan rice as us ambassador to the united nations .
now obama will need to fill the top diplomatic posts in prestigious world capitals such as london , paris , moscow and tokyo as well as the sunny caribbean .
although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .
“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .
and now that caroline kennedy , an early obama supporter , has withdrawn from the new york senate race , the british national newspapers are even speculating that jfk 's daughter could follow the steps of her grandfather joseph p. kennedy as us ambassador in london . holbrooke served in newly reunified germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy 's grandfather was us ambassador to britain germany too has had its share of distinguished us ambassadors , who have been heavy hitters in foreign policy arena : walter stoessel had been us ambassador to the soviet union and interim secretary of state in 1982 ; vernon walters , a former un ambassador and deputy cia chief , was renowned for his linguistic prowess ; john kornblum , a career diplomat , had played a key role in the east-west détente that led to the end of the cold war , and richard holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan .
such an illustrious precedent has made the last two bush appointees — dan coats , an indiana senator and william timken , an ohio industrialist , both who speak no german , look somewhat pale in comparison .
joerg duppler , berlin director of the atlantic treaty association , who knows timken , feels that us-german ties are so close that who the american ambassador is has little impact on bilateral relations anyway .
“ timken did his job well .
he represented his president .
his job was n't to be popular with germans , ” said duppler . the devil who wears prada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wintour was the inspiration behind " devil wears prada " one of europe 's most coveted posts is paris , where two recent american ambassadors were hugely popular with the french elite . in a country where benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson once served , british-born pamela churchill harriman was long on pedigree , but short on experience .
linked by marriage to some of the most powerful men of the 20th century , harriman , a big fundraiser for the democratic party , had served during former president bill clinton 's first term .
her successor was felix rohatyn , the lazard freres investment banker , who had rescued new york city from bankruptcy in the 1970s .
“ they could n't have been more different , but were each very effective in their own way .
she was the socialite star ; he was the business intellectual star .
then there was arthur hartman , that rare career diplomat , who was a true professional .
the rest you do n't remember , " said ifri 's moisi . rumor has it that another american with a british accent could become obama 's ambassador to france .
fashion icon anna wintour , the editor of vogue magazine , hosted fundraisers for obama and got some big names behind his campaign .
moisi was amused by the thought that wintour , who reportedly inspired the chick lit novel " the devil wears prada " could be up for paris .
" why not ?
that would be fun .

president barack obama stands for change , but one white house practice endures : appointing non-career diplomats to plum postings abroad . within his first two days in office , president barack obama named richard holbrooke and george mitchell as special envoys to the world 's hot spots and the senate unanimously confirmed susan rice as us ambassador to the united nations .
now obama will need to fill the top diplomatic posts in prestigious world capitals such as london , paris , moscow and tokyo as well as the sunny caribbean .
although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .
“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .
and now that caroline kennedy , an early obama supporter , has withdrawn from the new york senate race , the british national newspapers are even speculating that jfk 's daughter could follow the steps of her grandfather joseph p. kennedy as us ambassador in london . holbrooke served in newly reunified germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy 's grandfather was us ambassador to britain germany too has had its share of distinguished us ambassadors , who have been heavy hitters in foreign policy arena : walter stoessel had been us ambassador to the soviet union and interim secretary of state in 1982 ; vernon walters , a former un ambassador and deputy cia chief , was renowned for his linguistic prowess ; john kornblum , a career diplomat , had played a key role in the east-west détente that led to the end of the cold war , and richard holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan .
such an illustrious precedent has made the last two bush appointees — dan coats , an indiana senator and william timken , an ohio industrialist , both who speak no german , look somewhat pale in comparison .
joerg duppler , berlin director of the atlantic treaty association , who knows timken , feels that us-german ties are so close that who the american ambassador is has little impact on bilateral relations anyway .
“ timken did his job well .
he represented his president .
his job was n't to be popular with germans , ” said duppler . the devil who wears prada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wintour was the inspiration behind " devil wears prada " one of europe 's most coveted posts is paris , where two recent american ambassadors were hugely popular with the french elite . in a country where benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson once served , british-born pamela churchill harriman was long on pedigree , but short on experience .
linked by marriage to some of the most powerful men of the 20th century , harriman , a big fundraiser for the democratic party , had served during former president bill clinton 's first term .
her successor was felix rohatyn , the lazard freres investment banker , who had rescued new york city from bankruptcy in the 1970s .
“ they could n't have been more different , but were each very effective in their own way .
she was the socialite star ; he was the business intellectual star .
then there was arthur hartman , that rare career diplomat , who was a true professional .
the rest you do n't remember , " said ifri 's moisi . rumor has it that another american with a british accent could become obama 's ambassador to france .

what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .
and now that caroline kennedy , an early obama supporter , has withdrawn from the new york senate race , the british national newspapers are even speculating that jfk 's daughter could follow the steps of her grandfather joseph p. kennedy as us ambassador in london . holbrooke served in newly reunified germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy 's grandfather was us ambassador to britain germany too has had its share of distinguished us ambassadors , who have been heavy hitters in foreign policy arena : walter stoessel had been us ambassador to the soviet union and interim secretary of state in 1982 ; vernon walters , a former un ambassador and deputy cia chief , was renowned for his linguistic prowess ; john kornblum , a career diplomat , had played a key role in the east-west détente that led to the end of the cold war , and richard holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan .
such an illustrious precedent has made the last two bush appointees — dan coats , an indiana senator and william timken , an ohio industrialist , both who speak no german , look somewhat pale in comparison .
joerg duppler , berlin director of the atlantic treaty association , who knows timken , feels that us-german ties are so close that who the american ambassador is has little impact on bilateral relations anyway .
“ timken did his job well .
he represented his president .

fashion icon anna wintour for paris ?
president barack obama stands for change , but one white house practice endures : appointing non-career diplomats to plum postings abroad . within his first two days in office , president barack obama named richard holbrooke and george mitchell as special envoys to the world 's hot spots and the senate unanimously confirmed susan rice as us ambassador to the united nations .
now obama will need to fill the top diplomatic posts in prestigious world capitals such as london , paris , moscow and tokyo as well as the sunny caribbean .
although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .
“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .

carbon trading seen as a way forward with the issues of climate change and the global economic crisis coming to a head simultaneously , world leaders have focused on tying the two together , and businessmen saturday were trying to find ways to make money from a green economy . europe 's carbon credit trading program , in its second phase , is seen as being on the path to putting a price on pollution and creating a market that would allow for profit making . " pricing and cost will force a lot of adjustment for people , " said pierre lagrange , an alternative energy investor , but added that a trading program " could only work if it were globally accepted . " he said europe 's politicians have expressed interest in setting more aggressive carbon reduction goals , if the rest of the world got on board . with the 192 countries planning to meet in december in copenhagen , in attempt to reach a new global climate deal , engaging with developing nations will be crucial to the outcome of the process . scheme plans to trade carbon like currency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries could trade carbon credits like currency capping carbon emissions would force producers who exceed their permitted output amounts to buy credits from companies who have not , creating new jobs in the new market and also reducing carbon outputs by attaching a price to it . to get people trading across borders , lars josefsson , from the large european power producer vattenfall , suggested treating the credits in each country - which would each likely introduce its own system - like currency exchanges , which let people with one brand of cash do business with someone with another . " this is a pragmatic way to go about globalizing cap and trade markets , " he said , referring to the markets to cap or limit carbon emissions by trading them . ultimately , lagrange said , the caps on emissions will have to be extended to the user , and not only to the energy producer . " the place to start is behavior change , " said us congressman brian baird .
" the goal should be 20 per cent reduction in 20 weeks .
just walk through your daily life and see how much you can reduce . " " energy efficiency is very doable , and 50 per cent of the solution , " said nic frances , who runs a company which focuses on reducing power consumption .
" it 's what we do in our homes , domestic energy efficiency . " fears of greedy exploitation of carbon trading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing electric and hybrid cars would create jobs concerns though have been made that carbon trading would lead to yet another market which could be used for profit without bringing about the needed improvements to the environment , while also it would inhibit the creation of new technologies and instead focusing on cleaning up the old ones .

brown said that climate change would feature prominently at the next g20 meeting in april as it was " essential to recovery of the world economy . "
" the main obstacle during 2009 on the road to copenhagen may be the financial crisis , " said danish prime minister anders rasmussen .
in december , representatives of most countries will gather in copenhagen , denmark and attempt to knock out a new climate deal , but some environmentalists have expressed concern that not enough will be done before then to enable the nations to reach an agreement .
" we have to get it right in copenhagen , there is no second chance here , " said yvo de boer , head of the un 's framework convention on climate change .
" we must decide to put a price on carbon , " said al gore , the former us vice president , adding that president barack obama would play a positive role in combating climate change .
" he is pushing hard for dramatic and bold moves in the right direction , " said gore , noting that the house of representatives had passed a stimulus bill , " the largest component of which is a green stimulus . "
" we must appreciate the magnitude of change in united state 's leadership , " said gore .
the previous administration in washington , dc , was accused of hindering attempts to reach agreements on climate change .
alternative energy sources as economic benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts at davos say alternative energy can help the economy panelists at sessions in davos said alternative energies , to replace oil , coal and other sources of power which emit carbon dioxide and create pollution , would also have economic advantages and help spur the economy , and could be an essential part of spurring the world out of the downturn .
ban compared advancing green technologies to " killing two birds with one stone . "
reaching the goals in copenhagen , rasmussen said , would require industrialized and developing nations to work together to set reduction targets .
carbon trading seen as a way forward with the issues of climate change and the global economic crisis coming to a head simultaneously , world leaders have focused on tying the two together , and businessmen saturday were trying to find ways to make money from a green economy . europe 's carbon credit trading program , in its second phase , is seen as being on the path to putting a price on pollution and creating a market that would allow for profit making .

some say its time for action despite the absence of cabinet members of the new us administration at the world economic forum , president obama is all the talk in davos .
can he reverse the ailing economy and restore america 's role in the world ? predictions of the imminent decline of the us as the major global power are nothing new .
back in 1988 , the late samuel huntington wrote a long essay about what he described as the fifth way of declinism since the 1950 's .
then , as now , economic and military factors were the major factors why many perceived the us to be on a slow but steady downward spiral as a great power .
however , there are many stark differences between 1998 and 2008 and 2009 that make it difficult to compare the periods , for example , the demise of the soviet union and the rise of islamic extremism , and most importantly , globalization .
us a constant topic in davos with the world in the midst of the biggest economic crisis since the great depression , what are the chances that the us under its new president barack obama can master the situation , and how will the us and the world be changed through this crisis ?
this is a question that is being discussed almost incessantly at the world economic forum in davos .
of course , the subject is not addressed as such , but it is the theme that runs as an undercurrent through almost any small talk or debate .
and while all the latest economic indicators signal more doom and gloom for the world 's biggest economy - house prices decline by almost 20 percent , durable goods orders decline for the fifth month in a row , unemployment skyrocketing - the amount of respect and hope business and government leaders from around the world place on president barack obama to turn the u.s. economy around and restore the country 's stature in the world is astonishing .
" i am a huge fan of barack obama , " says klaas kersting , ceo of gameforge ag , a german online gaming start-up .
" i think he had a really good start of turning things around to bring the u.s. out of its moral crisis . "

what it requires is the confidence and the courage to do so . "
while president obama won international praise for some of the early decisions he made right after taking office , linda lorimer , vice president of yale university , makes a different argument : " i think the steps they took before the inauguration are even more important than what they have done in the first days of the administration , which is have a sense of prospect and promise .
i think those of us here who are in business or academia know that leadership today is about teamwork .
america needs to assert its leadership by showing it is part of the team of leading countries in the world and no longer is a go-it-alone kind of enterprise . "
listen , do n't patronise the sentiment expressed by lorimer that the us should again engage and cooperate with other nations is also common theme in davos .
" barack obama must make sure that on africa he listens to africans and not to come to africa and patronise africa , " says zimbabwe 's deputy prime minister mutambara .
" we in africa know what is good for ourselves and americans and the international community must listen to us not the other way around . "

" this may even lead to a un economic council , just as the security council was created after world war ii , " she told the world economic forum 's annual meeting in switzerland . she also called on governments to take responsibility for their economies and flex greater control of the markets . " the state is the guardian of the economic and social order so it has a very clear role .
competition is necessary but it is something that also needs a certain discipline and principles , " she said . " freedom is a necessary precondition for market forces to operate .

this must not be allowed to last too long because they inevitably lead to some distortion and are , quite frankly , protectionist . " safeguarding the environment and reducing the poverty gap were also principles that merkel says " need to be enshrined in the form of a global economic order charter " that " could lead to the establishment of a un economic council . " merkel 's proposal is an expansion on british prime minister gordon brown 's call to update the 1944 bretton woods structure that established the world bank and international monetary fund , which are now being used to bail out countries during the financial crisis . the british leader warned earlier in the day against financial protectionism that would lead to " a retreat of globalization and a reduction of trade and cross-border activity , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's gordon brown and angela merkel brown will host the group of 20 leaders summit of major developed and emerging nations outside london in april .
he indicated his goal would be to agree on worldwide fiscal stimulus . merkel also underlined the upcoming g20 leaders meeting as the best forum to tackle the issue and indicated her positive outlook despite the continuing financial meltdown .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 31.01.2009 obama deliberates over picking us ambassadors for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us embassy in paris is one of the most sought-after posts caroline kennedy as us ambassador to britain ?
fashion icon anna wintour for paris ?
president barack obama stands for change , but one white house practice endures : appointing non-career diplomats to plum postings abroad . within his first two days in office , president barack obama named richard holbrooke and george mitchell as special envoys to the world 's hot spots and the senate unanimously confirmed susan rice as us ambassador to the united nations .
now obama will need to fill the top diplomatic posts in prestigious world capitals such as london , paris , moscow and tokyo as well as the sunny caribbean .
although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .
“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .

fashion icon anna wintour for paris ?
president barack obama stands for change , but one white house practice endures : appointing non-career diplomats to plum postings abroad . within his first two days in office , president barack obama named richard holbrooke and george mitchell as special envoys to the world 's hot spots and the senate unanimously confirmed susan rice as us ambassador to the united nations .
now obama will need to fill the top diplomatic posts in prestigious world capitals such as london , paris , moscow and tokyo as well as the sunny caribbean .
although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .
“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .
and now that caroline kennedy , an early obama supporter , has withdrawn from the new york senate race , the british national newspapers are even speculating that jfk 's daughter could follow the steps of her grandfather joseph p. kennedy as us ambassador in london . holbrooke served in newly reunified germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy 's grandfather was us ambassador to britain germany too has had its share of distinguished us ambassadors , who have been heavy hitters in foreign policy arena : walter stoessel had been us ambassador to the soviet union and interim secretary of state in 1982 ; vernon walters , a former un ambassador and deputy cia chief , was renowned for his linguistic prowess ; john kornblum , a career diplomat , had played a key role in the east-west détente that led to the end of the cold war , and richard holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan .

in science today , only one percent of the papers published are in german , the council said .
an increasing number of foreign academics coming to germany for research or conference purposes add to the pressure on german scientists to present and work in english , as many visitors arrive with very basic or no german skills .
the council said that foreign guest professors coming to germany to teach or to join research institutes were " under the impression they do not need to learn german , because english will do . "
this was because a knowledge of german was not necessary in order to be able to communicate in universities and non-university research establishments with german colleagues .
most german academics prefer to publish in english as well as making it easier to speak with foreign colleagues , german academics also prefered english over their native language when it comes to publishing their work , the council said .
it therefore called for the increased promotion of scientific publications in german .
the council admitted its concern over the future of the language , saying that the loss of scientific german could lead to a loss at scientific thinking , because " science thinking is connected to language and culture . "
the fear was , it added , that german as an international scientific language could suffer in the long term .
" upholding the scientific german language has nothing to do with protectionism or nationalism , " olaf zimmermann , the council secretary , said .
" on the contrary , it concerns the security of cultural diversity and cultural self-sufficiency . "
zimmermann called for more funding of the arts , where german was still a significant language .
he demanded that all academic conferences held in germany be conducted in both english and german , not english alone .
" it should be natural therefore that during international conferences in germany , german should be one of the working languages . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fashion icon anna wintour for paris ?
president barack obama stands for change , but one white house practice endures : appointing non-career diplomats to plum postings abroad . within his first two days in office , president barack obama named richard holbrooke and george mitchell as special envoys to the world 's hot spots and the senate unanimously confirmed susan rice as us ambassador to the united nations .
now obama will need to fill the top diplomatic posts in prestigious world capitals such as london , paris , moscow and tokyo as well as the sunny caribbean .
although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .
“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .
and now that caroline kennedy , an early obama supporter , has withdrawn from the new york senate race , the british national newspapers are even speculating that jfk 's daughter could follow the steps of her grandfather joseph p. kennedy as us ambassador in london . holbrooke served in newly reunified germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy 's grandfather was us ambassador to britain germany too has had its share of distinguished us ambassadors , who have been heavy hitters in foreign policy arena : walter stoessel had been us ambassador to the soviet union and interim secretary of state in 1982 ; vernon walters , a former un ambassador and deputy cia chief , was renowned for his linguistic prowess ; john kornblum , a career diplomat , had played a key role in the east-west détente that led to the end of the cold war , and richard holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan .
such an illustrious precedent has made the last two bush appointees — dan coats , an indiana senator and william timken , an ohio industrialist , both who speak no german , look somewhat pale in comparison .
joerg duppler , berlin director of the atlantic treaty association , who knows timken , feels that us-german ties are so close that who the american ambassador is has little impact on bilateral relations anyway .
“ timken did his job well .
he represented his president .
his job was n't to be popular with germans , ” said duppler . the devil who wears prada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wintour was the inspiration behind " devil wears prada " one of europe 's most coveted posts is paris , where two recent american ambassadors were hugely popular with the french elite . in a country where benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson once served , british-born pamela churchill harriman was long on pedigree , but short on experience .
linked by marriage to some of the most powerful men of the 20th century , harriman , a big fundraiser for the democratic party , had served during former president bill clinton 's first term .
her successor was felix rohatyn , the lazard freres investment banker , who had rescued new york city from bankruptcy in the 1970s .
“ they could n't have been more different , but were each very effective in their own way .
she was the socialite star ; he was the business intellectual star .
then there was arthur hartman , that rare career diplomat , who was a true professional .
the rest you do n't remember , " said ifri 's moisi . rumor has it that another american with a british accent could become obama 's ambassador to france .
fashion icon anna wintour , the editor of vogue magazine , hosted fundraisers for obama and got some big names behind his campaign .
moisi was amused by the thought that wintour , who reportedly inspired the chick lit novel " the devil wears prada " could be up for paris .
" why not ?
that would be fun .

“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .
and now that caroline kennedy , an early obama supporter , has withdrawn from the new york senate race , the british national newspapers are even speculating that jfk 's daughter could follow the steps of her grandfather joseph p. kennedy as us ambassador in london . holbrooke served in newly reunified germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy 's grandfather was us ambassador to britain germany too has had its share of distinguished us ambassadors , who have been heavy hitters in foreign policy arena : walter stoessel had been us ambassador to the soviet union and interim secretary of state in 1982 ; vernon walters , a former un ambassador and deputy cia chief , was renowned for his linguistic prowess ; john kornblum , a career diplomat , had played a key role in the east-west détente that led to the end of the cold war , and richard holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan .
such an illustrious precedent has made the last two bush appointees — dan coats , an indiana senator and william timken , an ohio industrialist , both who speak no german , look somewhat pale in comparison .
joerg duppler , berlin director of the atlantic treaty association , who knows timken , feels that us-german ties are so close that who the american ambassador is has little impact on bilateral relations anyway .
“ timken did his job well .
he represented his president .
his job was n't to be popular with germans , ” said duppler . the devil who wears prada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wintour was the inspiration behind " devil wears prada " one of europe 's most coveted posts is paris , where two recent american ambassadors were hugely popular with the french elite . in a country where benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson once served , british-born pamela churchill harriman was long on pedigree , but short on experience .
linked by marriage to some of the most powerful men of the 20th century , harriman , a big fundraiser for the democratic party , had served during former president bill clinton 's first term .
her successor was felix rohatyn , the lazard freres investment banker , who had rescued new york city from bankruptcy in the 1970s .
“ they could n't have been more different , but were each very effective in their own way .
she was the socialite star ; he was the business intellectual star .
then there was arthur hartman , that rare career diplomat , who was a true professional .
the rest you do n't remember , " said ifri 's moisi . rumor has it that another american with a british accent could become obama 's ambassador to france .
fashion icon anna wintour , the editor of vogue magazine , hosted fundraisers for obama and got some big names behind his campaign .
moisi was amused by the thought that wintour , who reportedly inspired the chick lit novel " the devil wears prada " could be up for paris .
" why not ?
that would be fun .

" this may even lead to a un economic council , just as the security council was created after world war ii , " she told the world economic forum 's annual meeting in switzerland . she also called on governments to take responsibility for their economies and flex greater control of the markets . " the state is the guardian of the economic and social order so it has a very clear role .
competition is necessary but it is something that also needs a certain discipline and principles , " she said . " freedom is a necessary precondition for market forces to operate .
but individual freedom needs to be limited if it takes freedom away from others . " merkel criticizes us subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says subsidies in the auto industry will lead to " distortion " saying that the word needs " clear-cut rules in clear contrast to an unfettered capitalism that runs enormous financial risks , " merkel also used her speech to take aim at the us for subsidizing ailing car companies . the chancellor said she was " very wary of seeing subsidies in the united states being injected right now into the automobile industry .
this must not be allowed to last too long because they inevitably lead to some distortion and are , quite frankly , protectionist . " safeguarding the environment and reducing the poverty gap were also principles that merkel says " need to be enshrined in the form of a global economic order charter " that " could lead to the establishment of a un economic council . " merkel 's proposal is an expansion on british prime minister gordon brown 's call to update the 1944 bretton woods structure that established the world bank and international monetary fund , which are now being used to bail out countries during the financial crisis . the british leader warned earlier in the day against financial protectionism that would lead to " a retreat of globalization and a reduction of trade and cross-border activity , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's gordon brown and angela merkel brown will host the group of 20 leaders summit of major developed and emerging nations outside london in april .
he indicated his goal would be to agree on worldwide fiscal stimulus . merkel also underlined the upcoming g20 leaders meeting as the best forum to tackle the issue and indicated her positive outlook despite the continuing financial meltdown . " even this worldwide financial crisis can be mastered .
we can master it in such a way that we turn create progress that will enable us to better live together on this planet , " she said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this may even lead to a un economic council , just as the security council was created after world war ii , " she told the world economic forum 's annual meeting in switzerland . she also called on governments to take responsibility for their economies and flex greater control of the markets . " the state is the guardian of the economic and social order so it has a very clear role .
competition is necessary but it is something that also needs a certain discipline and principles , " she said . " freedom is a necessary precondition for market forces to operate .
but individual freedom needs to be limited if it takes freedom away from others . " merkel criticizes us subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says subsidies in the auto industry will lead to " distortion " saying that the word needs " clear-cut rules in clear contrast to an unfettered capitalism that runs enormous financial risks , " merkel also used her speech to take aim at the us for subsidizing ailing car companies . the chancellor said she was " very wary of seeing subsidies in the united states being injected right now into the automobile industry .
this must not be allowed to last too long because they inevitably lead to some distortion and are , quite frankly , protectionist . " safeguarding the environment and reducing the poverty gap were also principles that merkel says " need to be enshrined in the form of a global economic order charter " that " could lead to the establishment of a un economic council . " merkel 's proposal is an expansion on british prime minister gordon brown 's call to update the 1944 bretton woods structure that established the world bank and international monetary fund , which are now being used to bail out countries during the financial crisis . the british leader warned earlier in the day against financial protectionism that would lead to " a retreat of globalization and a reduction of trade and cross-border activity , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's gordon brown and angela merkel brown will host the group of 20 leaders summit of major developed and emerging nations outside london in april .
he indicated his goal would be to agree on worldwide fiscal stimulus . merkel also underlined the upcoming g20 leaders meeting as the best forum to tackle the issue and indicated her positive outlook despite the continuing financial meltdown . " even this worldwide financial crisis can be mastered .
we can master it in such a way that we turn create progress that will enable us to better live together on this planet , " she said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 31.01.2009 obama deliberates over picking us ambassadors for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us embassy in paris is one of the most sought-after posts caroline kennedy as us ambassador to britain ?
fashion icon anna wintour for paris ?
president barack obama stands for change , but one white house practice endures : appointing non-career diplomats to plum postings abroad . within his first two days in office , president barack obama named richard holbrooke and george mitchell as special envoys to the world 's hot spots and the senate unanimously confirmed susan rice as us ambassador to the united nations .
now obama will need to fill the top diplomatic posts in prestigious world capitals such as london , paris , moscow and tokyo as well as the sunny caribbean .
although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .
“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .
and now that caroline kennedy , an early obama supporter , has withdrawn from the new york senate race , the british national newspapers are even speculating that jfk 's daughter could follow the steps of her grandfather joseph p. kennedy as us ambassador in london . holbrooke served in newly reunified germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy 's grandfather was us ambassador to britain germany too has had its share of distinguished us ambassadors , who have been heavy hitters in foreign policy arena : walter stoessel had been us ambassador to the soviet union and interim secretary of state in 1982 ; vernon walters , a former un ambassador and deputy cia chief , was renowned for his linguistic prowess ; john kornblum , a career diplomat , had played a key role in the east-west détente that led to the end of the cold war , and richard holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan .
such an illustrious precedent has made the last two bush appointees — dan coats , an indiana senator and william timken , an ohio industrialist , both who speak no german , look somewhat pale in comparison .
joerg duppler , berlin director of the atlantic treaty association , who knows timken , feels that us-german ties are so close that who the american ambassador is has little impact on bilateral relations anyway .
“ timken did his job well .
he represented his president .
his job was n't to be popular with germans , ” said duppler . the devil who wears prada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wintour was the inspiration behind " devil wears prada " one of europe 's most coveted posts is paris , where two recent american ambassadors were hugely popular with the french elite . in a country where benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson once served , british-born pamela churchill harriman was long on pedigree , but short on experience .
linked by marriage to some of the most powerful men of the 20th century , harriman , a big fundraiser for the democratic party , had served during former president bill clinton 's first term .
her successor was felix rohatyn , the lazard freres investment banker , who had rescued new york city from bankruptcy in the 1970s .
“ they could n't have been more different , but were each very effective in their own way .
she was the socialite star ; he was the business intellectual star .
then there was arthur hartman , that rare career diplomat , who was a true professional .
the rest you do n't remember , " said ifri 's moisi . rumor has it that another american with a british accent could become obama 's ambassador to france .
fashion icon anna wintour , the editor of vogue magazine , hosted fundraisers for obama and got some big names behind his campaign .
moisi was amused by the thought that wintour , who reportedly inspired the chick lit novel " the devil wears prada " could be up for paris .
" why not ?
that would be fun .

an increasing number of foreign academics coming to germany for research or conference purposes add to the pressure on german scientists to present and work in english , as many visitors arrive with very basic or no german skills .
the council said that foreign guest professors coming to germany to teach or to join research institutes were " under the impression they do not need to learn german , because english will do . "
this was because a knowledge of german was not necessary in order to be able to communicate in universities and non-university research establishments with german colleagues .

in science today , only one percent of the papers published are in german , the council said .
an increasing number of foreign academics coming to germany for research or conference purposes add to the pressure on german scientists to present and work in english , as many visitors arrive with very basic or no german skills .
the council said that foreign guest professors coming to germany to teach or to join research institutes were " under the impression they do not need to learn german , because english will do . "
this was because a knowledge of german was not necessary in order to be able to communicate in universities and non-university research establishments with german colleagues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 31.01.2009 obama deliberates over picking us ambassadors for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us embassy in paris is one of the most sought-after posts caroline kennedy as us ambassador to britain ?
fashion icon anna wintour for paris ?
president barack obama stands for change , but one white house practice endures : appointing non-career diplomats to plum postings abroad . within his first two days in office , president barack obama named richard holbrooke and george mitchell as special envoys to the world 's hot spots and the senate unanimously confirmed susan rice as us ambassador to the united nations .
now obama will need to fill the top diplomatic posts in prestigious world capitals such as london , paris , moscow and tokyo as well as the sunny caribbean .
although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .
“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .
and now that caroline kennedy , an early obama supporter , has withdrawn from the new york senate race , the british national newspapers are even speculating that jfk 's daughter could follow the steps of her grandfather joseph p. kennedy as us ambassador in london . holbrooke served in newly reunified germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy 's grandfather was us ambassador to britain germany too has had its share of distinguished us ambassadors , who have been heavy hitters in foreign policy arena : walter stoessel had been us ambassador to the soviet union and interim secretary of state in 1982 ; vernon walters , a former un ambassador and deputy cia chief , was renowned for his linguistic prowess ; john kornblum , a career diplomat , had played a key role in the east-west détente that led to the end of the cold war , and richard holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan .
such an illustrious precedent has made the last two bush appointees — dan coats , an indiana senator and william timken , an ohio industrialist , both who speak no german , look somewhat pale in comparison .
joerg duppler , berlin director of the atlantic treaty association , who knows timken , feels that us-german ties are so close that who the american ambassador is has little impact on bilateral relations anyway .
“ timken did his job well .
he represented his president .
his job was n't to be popular with germans , ” said duppler . the devil who wears prada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wintour was the inspiration behind " devil wears prada " one of europe 's most coveted posts is paris , where two recent american ambassadors were hugely popular with the french elite . in a country where benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson once served , british-born pamela churchill harriman was long on pedigree , but short on experience .
linked by marriage to some of the most powerful men of the 20th century , harriman , a big fundraiser for the democratic party , had served during former president bill clinton 's first term .
her successor was felix rohatyn , the lazard freres investment banker , who had rescued new york city from bankruptcy in the 1970s .
“ they could n't have been more different , but were each very effective in their own way .
she was the socialite star ; he was the business intellectual star .
then there was arthur hartman , that rare career diplomat , who was a true professional .
the rest you do n't remember , " said ifri 's moisi . rumor has it that another american with a british accent could become obama 's ambassador to france .
fashion icon anna wintour , the editor of vogue magazine , hosted fundraisers for obama and got some big names behind his campaign .
moisi was amused by the thought that wintour , who reportedly inspired the chick lit novel " the devil wears prada " could be up for paris .
" why not ?
that would be fun .

some of the visitors leave behind their most intimate thoughts , wishes and prayers . " thank you for giving me the strength to kick my habit , " reads one anonymous comment .
another is from ollie : " i 'd been driving back and forth past this spot for nearly half a year before i decided to stop and seek out your house . " the protestant church of st. martin in waldlaubersheim is one of 33 such churches located alongside germany 's famous autobahns , an institution which celebrated 50 years in a ceremony in a church on the a8 in adelsried in 2008 .
more than 1 million people visit them every year . these houses of worship invite people to seek " relaxation , refuge and contemplation . "
the churches are " rest stops for the soul , " according to the website autobahnkirche.info maintained by the bruderhilfe pastoral organization in kassel . highway chapels curb road rage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stopping at an autobahn church may ease traffic-jam tension " drivers who stop at an autobahn church tend to continue their journey in a more relaxed manner and are more considerate to other road-users which goes to show that a visit contributes to road safety , " the custodians of the church write . yet what qualifies a church to be an autobahn chapel ?
" it must be close to a motorway exit and stay open the whole day , " said birgit krause who works for the bruderhilfe . although the autobahn churches maintain no firm links with each other , their pastors do meet once a year to exchange ideas .
most of the chapels are protestant , but the doors are open to worshippers of all confessions , said krause . many of the churches are remote from rural communities , yet damage or vandalism is no more of a problem than it is elsewhere .
" people are coming in and out the whole time which acts as a check on anti-social behavior . " until 1991 , st. martin 's church was a house of worship for people from waldlaubersheim until a local vineyard owner came up with the idea of turning it into an autobahn chapel . drivers just want simple rituals " he was on the road a lot in his car delivering wine and knew how stressful driving can be , " explained pastor joachim deserno .
" in the beginning , we racked our brains over all the things we would need to provide for visitors until it suddenly occurred to us - they do n't actually want much . " the guestbook is an important feature along with a leaflet containing a blessing for each visitor .
drivers can also write down their prayers , wishes and concerns on slips of paper and attach them to a large wooden crucifix .
candles can be lit in a corner next to the altar while to the rear of the transept , below the handsome old organ , stands a table with toys and books for children . bildunterschrift : autobahn churches are especially popular with the elderly " that has come in use for local services too , " said deserno . experts from the catholic university of applied sciences in freiburg found in a survey that a typical visitor to an autobahn chapel is at least 50 years old , with men churchgoers outnumbering women . a study of 400 questionnaires also revealed that two-thirds of visitors come in from the road not just to rest but to pray , light a candle or take part in a religious service .
the majority of visitors were catholics . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .
and now that caroline kennedy , an early obama supporter , has withdrawn from the new york senate race , the british national newspapers are even speculating that jfk 's daughter could follow the steps of her grandfather joseph p. kennedy as us ambassador in london . holbrooke served in newly reunified germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy 's grandfather was us ambassador to britain germany too has had its share of distinguished us ambassadors , who have been heavy hitters in foreign policy arena : walter stoessel had been us ambassador to the soviet union and interim secretary of state in 1982 ; vernon walters , a former un ambassador and deputy cia chief , was renowned for his linguistic prowess ; john kornblum , a career diplomat , had played a key role in the east-west détente that led to the end of the cold war , and richard holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan .
such an illustrious precedent has made the last two bush appointees — dan coats , an indiana senator and william timken , an ohio industrialist , both who speak no german , look somewhat pale in comparison .
joerg duppler , berlin director of the atlantic treaty association , who knows timken , feels that us-german ties are so close that who the american ambassador is has little impact on bilateral relations anyway .
“ timken did his job well .
he represented his president .
his job was n't to be popular with germans , ” said duppler . the devil who wears prada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wintour was the inspiration behind " devil wears prada " one of europe 's most coveted posts is paris , where two recent american ambassadors were hugely popular with the french elite . in a country where benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson once served , british-born pamela churchill harriman was long on pedigree , but short on experience .
linked by marriage to some of the most powerful men of the 20th century , harriman , a big fundraiser for the democratic party , had served during former president bill clinton 's first term .
her successor was felix rohatyn , the lazard freres investment banker , who had rescued new york city from bankruptcy in the 1970s .
“ they could n't have been more different , but were each very effective in their own way .
she was the socialite star ; he was the business intellectual star .
then there was arthur hartman , that rare career diplomat , who was a true professional .
the rest you do n't remember , " said ifri 's moisi . rumor has it that another american with a british accent could become obama 's ambassador to france .
fashion icon anna wintour , the editor of vogue magazine , hosted fundraisers for obama and got some big names behind his campaign .
moisi was amused by the thought that wintour , who reportedly inspired the chick lit novel " the devil wears prada " could be up for paris .
" why not ?
that would be fun .

" we must appreciate the magnitude of change in united state 's leadership , " said gore .
the previous administration in washington , dc , was accused of hindering attempts to reach agreements on climate change .
alternative energy sources as economic benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts at davos say alternative energy can help the economy panelists at sessions in davos said alternative energies , to replace oil , coal and other sources of power which emit carbon dioxide and create pollution , would also have economic advantages and help spur the economy , and could be an essential part of spurring the world out of the downturn .
ban compared advancing green technologies to " killing two birds with one stone . "
reaching the goals in copenhagen , rasmussen said , would require industrialized and developing nations to work together to set reduction targets .
carbon trading seen as a way forward with the issues of climate change and the global economic crisis coming to a head simultaneously , world leaders have focused on tying the two together , and businessmen saturday were trying to find ways to make money from a green economy . europe 's carbon credit trading program , in its second phase , is seen as being on the path to putting a price on pollution and creating a market that would allow for profit making . " pricing and cost will force a lot of adjustment for people , " said pierre lagrange , an alternative energy investor , but added that a trading program " could only work if it were globally accepted . " he said europe 's politicians have expressed interest in setting more aggressive carbon reduction goals , if the rest of the world got on board . with the 192 countries planning to meet in december in copenhagen , in attempt to reach a new global climate deal , engaging with developing nations will be crucial to the outcome of the process . scheme plans to trade carbon like currency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries could trade carbon credits like currency capping carbon emissions would force producers who exceed their permitted output amounts to buy credits from companies who have not , creating new jobs in the new market and also reducing carbon outputs by attaching a price to it . to get people trading across borders , lars josefsson , from the large european power producer vattenfall , suggested treating the credits in each country - which would each likely introduce its own system - like currency exchanges , which let people with one brand of cash do business with someone with another . " this is a pragmatic way to go about globalizing cap and trade markets , " he said , referring to the markets to cap or limit carbon emissions by trading them . ultimately , lagrange said , the caps on emissions will have to be extended to the user , and not only to the energy producer . " the place to start is behavior change , " said us congressman brian baird .
" the goal should be 20 per cent reduction in 20 weeks .
just walk through your daily life and see how much you can reduce . " " energy efficiency is very doable , and 50 per cent of the solution , " said nic frances , who runs a company which focuses on reducing power consumption .
" it 's what we do in our homes , domestic energy efficiency . " fears of greedy exploitation of carbon trading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing electric and hybrid cars would create jobs concerns though have been made that carbon trading would lead to yet another market which could be used for profit without bringing about the needed improvements to the environment , while also it would inhibit the creation of new technologies and instead focusing on cleaning up the old ones . " cap and trade is fine , " said daniel sperling , an author of two billion cars , a book focusing on the growing number of polluting vehicles in the world . " but we need something more technology forcing , which stimulates innovations , " sperling , a transportation expert , told the dpa news agency , adding that the economy would benefit . in his own field , he said , new , cleaner cars would create more jobs . " you can lower costs , create jobs and reduce lethal overheating , " said baird , using his preferred term in place of climate change , " and put money back in the pockets of consumers . " hopes were pinned on the new us administration taking the steps to make it happen . " if we turn climate change into an opportunity , it is the biggest opportunity since world war two , " said josefsson , referring to the economic expansion that was brought about as a result of the war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
pope benedict xvi 's pardon of williamson , along with three other ultra-conservative bishops , has threatened the vatican 's relationship with jewish leaders and led to an outburst of criticism within the catholic church .
two weeks ago , in an interview with swedish state television , williamson said " historical evidence is hugely against 6 million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on jan .

heavy burden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson has apologized to the pope for " distress " caused by his " imprudent " comments the president of germany 's jewish central committee , charlotte knobloch , made it clear on friday that the vatican 's decision weighed heavily on the relationship between jews and catholics .
in light of the pope 's german nationality , knobloch said she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . "
former chief rabbi israel meir lau , a survivor of buchenwald concentration camp , was quoted in spiegel asking , " how can such a liar be granted the protection and pardon of the leader of the catholic church ? "
german catholics protest german catholics have also reacted strongly to benedict 's decision .
in the city of muenster , where the pope once taught as a professor of theology , almost the entire catholic faculty signed a letter of protest , while theologians in the city of tuebingen described the decision as a " heavy burden " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of catholics have been disappointed by the pope swiss theologian hans kueng , speaking on german radio rbb , accused benedict of being out of touch with his " kingdom " .
in kueng 's words , " the pope has no critical people around him . "
in light of this wave of reactions , the vatican has sought to quell the outrage .
during his weekly general audience on wednesday , benedict said the memory of the holocaust can not be cancelled through any form of denial .
the german-born pontiff also recalled his own past pilgrimages to the former nazi death camp of auschwitz .
" the images i collected during my numerous visits to auschwitz bore witness to the innocent victims of a racial hatred , " he said .
questioning the church ?
spiegel reported that some german catholics are questioning their adherence to the church .
helmut reinhard , a catholic living in the city of munich , lost 15 members of his family in auschwitz-birkenau , " all of them gypsies , " he told the magazine , " and all of them catholic . "
as a result of the pope 's pardon , reinhard 's brother markus had left the catholic church , together with his wife and her four sisters , on holocaust memorial day .
now he too has had enough , he told the magazine , and was renouncing his membership .

"
pope benedict xvi 's pardon of williamson , along with three other ultra-conservative bishops , has threatened the vatican 's relationship with jewish leaders and led to an outburst of criticism within the catholic church .
two weeks ago , in an interview with swedish state television , williamson said " historical evidence is hugely against 6 million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on jan .

heavy burden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson has apologized to the pope for " distress " caused by his " imprudent " comments the president of germany 's jewish central committee , charlotte knobloch , made it clear on friday that the vatican 's decision weighed heavily on the relationship between jews and catholics .
in light of the pope 's german nationality , knobloch said she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . "
former chief rabbi israel meir lau , a survivor of buchenwald concentration camp , was quoted in spiegel asking , " how can such a liar be granted the protection and pardon of the leader of the catholic church ? "
german catholics protest german catholics have also reacted strongly to benedict 's decision .
in the city of muenster , where the pope once taught as a professor of theology , almost the entire catholic faculty signed a letter of protest , while theologians in the city of tuebingen described the decision as a " heavy burden " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of catholics have been disappointed by the pope swiss theologian hans kueng , speaking on german radio rbb , accused benedict of being out of touch with his " kingdom " .
in kueng 's words , " the pope has no critical people around him . "
in light of this wave of reactions , the vatican has sought to quell the outrage .
during his weekly general audience on wednesday , benedict said the memory of the holocaust can not be cancelled through any form of denial .
the german-born pontiff also recalled his own past pilgrimages to the former nazi death camp of auschwitz .
" the images i collected during my numerous visits to auschwitz bore witness to the innocent victims of a racial hatred , " he said .
questioning the church ?
spiegel reported that some german catholics are questioning their adherence to the church .
helmut reinhard , a catholic living in the city of munich , lost 15 members of his family in auschwitz-birkenau , " all of them gypsies , " he told the magazine , " and all of them catholic . "
as a result of the pope 's pardon , reinhard 's brother markus had left the catholic church , together with his wife and her four sisters , on holocaust memorial day .
now he too has had enough , he told the magazine , and was renouncing his membership .
german public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his remarks .

munich appeared superhuman in a 5-1 cup rout on tuesday at vfb stuttgart , but all their ambitions froze on a cold friday when they were beaten 1-0 by hamburg in the bundesliga restart .
mladen petric 's winner shortly before halftime made sure that hamburg and not munich moved to the top of the standings -lrb- at least until later saturday -rrb- to the delight of the 57,000-strong crowd .
instead of starting a planned winning streak to take the league by storm munich 's inconsistency prevailed in their third season defeat .

but you ca n't afford that against any team , and definitely not against hamburg . "
while toni was the man to blame up front it took french star franck ribery a long time to show his class as well .
ribery was accused of arrogance when he chipped a penalty right into the arms of goalkeeper jens lehmann in the cup match and on friday former munich great mehmet scholl , speaking on ard television , bluntly told the frenchman to get his own act together instead of calling for the signing of new players .
" he should n't forget where he was two years ago .

munich appeared superhuman in a 5-1 cup rout on tuesday at vfb stuttgart , but all their ambitions froze on a cold friday when they were beaten 1-0 by hamburg in the bundesliga restart .
mladen petric 's winner shortly before halftime made sure that hamburg and not munich moved to the top of the standings -lrb- at least until later saturday -rrb- to the delight of the 57,000-strong crowd .
instead of starting a planned winning streak to take the league by storm munich 's inconsistency prevailed in their third season defeat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 31.01.2009 mixture of support and skepticism for obama in davos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama entered office with the promise of change .
some say its time for action despite the absence of cabinet members of the new us administration at the world economic forum , president obama is all the talk in davos .
can he reverse the ailing economy and restore america 's role in the world ? predictions of the imminent decline of the us as the major global power are nothing new .
back in 1988 , the late samuel huntington wrote a long essay about what he described as the fifth way of declinism since the 1950 's .
then , as now , economic and military factors were the major factors why many perceived the us to be on a slow but steady downward spiral as a great power .
however , there are many stark differences between 1998 and 2008 and 2009 that make it difficult to compare the periods , for example , the demise of the soviet union and the rise of islamic extremism , and most importantly , globalization .
us a constant topic in davos with the world in the midst of the biggest economic crisis since the great depression , what are the chances that the us under its new president barack obama can master the situation , and how will the us and the world be changed through this crisis ?
this is a question that is being discussed almost incessantly at the world economic forum in davos .
of course , the subject is not addressed as such , but it is the theme that runs as an undercurrent through almost any small talk or debate .
and while all the latest economic indicators signal more doom and gloom for the world 's biggest economy - house prices decline by almost 20 percent , durable goods orders decline for the fifth month in a row , unemployment skyrocketing - the amount of respect and hope business and government leaders from around the world place on president barack obama to turn the u.s. economy around and restore the country 's stature in the world is astonishing .
" i am a huge fan of barack obama , " says klaas kersting , ceo of gameforge ag , a german online gaming start-up .
" i think he had a really good start of turning things around to bring the u.s. out of its moral crisis . "
african roots a factor for obama 's popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa , and kenya in particular , have high hopes for obama arthur mutambara , deputy prime minister of zimbabwe for the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , cites a different reason why he believes president obama can bring about the change he promised during his election campaign : " being of african extraction , being a son of a kenyan , yes , he has the potential to do it .
what it requires is the confidence and the courage to do so . "
while president obama won international praise for some of the early decisions he made right after taking office , linda lorimer , vice president of yale university , makes a different argument : " i think the steps they took before the inauguration are even more important than what they have done in the first days of the administration , which is have a sense of prospect and promise .
i think those of us here who are in business or academia know that leadership today is about teamwork .
america needs to assert its leadership by showing it is part of the team of leading countries in the world and no longer is a go-it-alone kind of enterprise . "
listen , do n't patronise the sentiment expressed by lorimer that the us should again engage and cooperate with other nations is also common theme in davos .
" barack obama must make sure that on africa he listens to africans and not to come to africa and patronise africa , " says zimbabwe 's deputy prime minister mutambara .
" we in africa know what is good for ourselves and americans and the international community must listen to us not the other way around . "
even iran 's foreign minister said here in davos that his country was ready to respond if america 's policy change was genuine .
while barack obama and his administration appear to have plenty of goodwill , trust and support from around the world , the question is whether that is enough .
according to all major indicators , the economic situation in the us looks so grim that a quick way out of the misery seems all but impossible . hard struggle ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and his team face huge challenges however , even a self-declared obama fan like gameforge ceo kersting turns pessimistic when being asked about a prediction whether the new administration can reverse the downward trend .
" the economic challenges are dramatic .
the us economy is significantly suffering - finance , automotive and all the suppliers for that matter .

us a constant topic in davos with the world in the midst of the biggest economic crisis since the great depression , what are the chances that the us under its new president barack obama can master the situation , and how will the us and the world be changed through this crisis ?
this is a question that is being discussed almost incessantly at the world economic forum in davos .
of course , the subject is not addressed as such , but it is the theme that runs as an undercurrent through almost any small talk or debate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.01.2009 german intelligence warns of high terror threat in election year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could be in the crosshairs of islamist terrorists in this election year germany faces an increased risk of islamist terror attacks ahead of national elections in september , security chiefs warned saturday . the head of the domestic intelligence agency , heinz fromm , said the probability of a terror attack is especially high , in an interview with the daily hamburger abendblatt .
in germany 's general election set for september 27 , the country 's troop presence in afghanistan , opposed by the majority of german citizens , is likely to be high on the agenda .
german chancellor angela merkel , presiding over a coalition government between her conservative cdu party and the spd on the left , has been instrumental in committing troops to the nato mission in afghanistan .
however the country 's foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , who is the spd 's election candidate , is critical of further troop deployment .
president of the federal police agency -lrb- bka -rrb- joerg ziercke warned that terrorists could attempt to influence the election outcome , similar to the madrid train bomb-attacks ahead of the spanish elections in 2004 .
" we are seeing clear parallels to the situation in spain , " zierke said in an interview with weekly news magazine focus .
parallels with spanish attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain suffered europe 's worst terror attack in 2004 ahead of spain 's 2004 elections , attacks on madrid 's commuter trains , in which 191 people died , achieved their aim of bringing about a change of government and a withdrawal of spanish troops from the us-led coalition in iraq .
bka-chief zierke said that radical converts to islam of german origin were especially dangerous .
" they know the german infrastructure , are socially integrated and hardly stand out because of their appearance . "
in the past weeks at least two videos have surfaced in which threats have been issued in german against countries with a military presence in afghanistan .
one video showed six masked men speaking in several languages , one of which was german , according to the german television channel ard .
" this year , we 've got a few surprise parcels for the occupying powers , since the allies of the occupying powers must always expect our attacks , " the german speaker said .
broadcasts carry threats to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has become increasingly referred to in islamist videos in an earlier video , a man identified as a moroccan-born german national demanded that germany withdraw its troops serving with nato in afghanistan .
in light of these internet postings , fromm said , " the most recent video messages clearly show that germany and german interests abroad are under threat . "
the intelligence chief said the videos show , " that attacks against our country are being prepared . "
at present , around 3000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan , as part of the country 's nato-led international security assistance force .
their role is restricted to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and they are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany 's general election set for september 27 , the country 's troop presence in afghanistan , opposed by the majority of german citizens , is likely to be high on the agenda .
german chancellor angela merkel , presiding over a coalition government between her conservative cdu party and the spd on the left , has been instrumental in committing troops to the nato mission in afghanistan .
however the country 's foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , who is the spd 's election candidate , is critical of further troop deployment .
president of the federal police agency -lrb- bka -rrb- joerg ziercke warned that terrorists could attempt to influence the election outcome , similar to the madrid train bomb-attacks ahead of the spanish elections in 2004 .
" we are seeing clear parallels to the situation in spain , " zierke said in an interview with weekly news magazine focus .
parallels with spanish attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain suffered europe 's worst terror attack in 2004 ahead of spain 's 2004 elections , attacks on madrid 's commuter trains , in which 191 people died , achieved their aim of bringing about a change of government and a withdrawal of spanish troops from the us-led coalition in iraq .
bka-chief zierke said that radical converts to islam of german origin were especially dangerous .
" they know the german infrastructure , are socially integrated and hardly stand out because of their appearance . "
in the past weeks at least two videos have surfaced in which threats have been issued in german against countries with a military presence in afghanistan .
one video showed six masked men speaking in several languages , one of which was german , according to the german television channel ard .
" this year , we 've got a few surprise parcels for the occupying powers , since the allies of the occupying powers must always expect our attacks , " the german speaker said .
broadcasts carry threats to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has become increasingly referred to in islamist videos in an earlier video , a man identified as a moroccan-born german national demanded that germany withdraw its troops serving with nato in afghanistan .
in light of these internet postings , fromm said , " the most recent video messages clearly show that germany and german interests abroad are under threat . "
the intelligence chief said the videos show , " that attacks against our country are being prepared . "
at present , around 3000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan , as part of the country 's nato-led international security assistance force .
their role is restricted to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and they are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brown said that climate change would feature prominently at the next g20 meeting in april as it was " essential to recovery of the world economy . "
" the main obstacle during 2009 on the road to copenhagen may be the financial crisis , " said danish prime minister anders rasmussen .
in december , representatives of most countries will gather in copenhagen , denmark and attempt to knock out a new climate deal , but some environmentalists have expressed concern that not enough will be done before then to enable the nations to reach an agreement .
" we have to get it right in copenhagen , there is no second chance here , " said yvo de boer , head of the un 's framework convention on climate change .
" we must decide to put a price on carbon , " said al gore , the former us vice president , adding that president barack obama would play a positive role in combating climate change .
" he is pushing hard for dramatic and bold moves in the right direction , " said gore , noting that the house of representatives had passed a stimulus bill , " the largest component of which is a green stimulus . "
" we must appreciate the magnitude of change in united state 's leadership , " said gore .
the previous administration in washington , dc , was accused of hindering attempts to reach agreements on climate change .
alternative energy sources as economic benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts at davos say alternative energy can help the economy panelists at sessions in davos said alternative energies , to replace oil , coal and other sources of power which emit carbon dioxide and create pollution , would also have economic advantages and help spur the economy , and could be an essential part of spurring the world out of the downturn .
ban compared advancing green technologies to " killing two birds with one stone . "
reaching the goals in copenhagen , rasmussen said , would require industrialized and developing nations to work together to set reduction targets .
carbon trading seen as a way forward with the issues of climate change and the global economic crisis coming to a head simultaneously , world leaders have focused on tying the two together , and businessmen saturday were trying to find ways to make money from a green economy . europe 's carbon credit trading program , in its second phase , is seen as being on the path to putting a price on pollution and creating a market that would allow for profit making . " pricing and cost will force a lot of adjustment for people , " said pierre lagrange , an alternative energy investor , but added that a trading program " could only work if it were globally accepted . " he said europe 's politicians have expressed interest in setting more aggressive carbon reduction goals , if the rest of the world got on board . with the 192 countries planning to meet in december in copenhagen , in attempt to reach a new global climate deal , engaging with developing nations will be crucial to the outcome of the process . scheme plans to trade carbon like currency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries could trade carbon credits like currency capping carbon emissions would force producers who exceed their permitted output amounts to buy credits from companies who have not , creating new jobs in the new market and also reducing carbon outputs by attaching a price to it . to get people trading across borders , lars josefsson , from the large european power producer vattenfall , suggested treating the credits in each country - which would each likely introduce its own system - like currency exchanges , which let people with one brand of cash do business with someone with another . " this is a pragmatic way to go about globalizing cap and trade markets , " he said , referring to the markets to cap or limit carbon emissions by trading them . ultimately , lagrange said , the caps on emissions will have to be extended to the user , and not only to the energy producer . " the place to start is behavior change , " said us congressman brian baird .
" the goal should be 20 per cent reduction in 20 weeks .
just walk through your daily life and see how much you can reduce . " " energy efficiency is very doable , and 50 per cent of the solution , " said nic frances , who runs a company which focuses on reducing power consumption .
" it 's what we do in our homes , domestic energy efficiency . " fears of greedy exploitation of carbon trading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing electric and hybrid cars would create jobs concerns though have been made that carbon trading would lead to yet another market which could be used for profit without bringing about the needed improvements to the environment , while also it would inhibit the creation of new technologies and instead focusing on cleaning up the old ones . " cap and trade is fine , " said daniel sperling , an author of two billion cars , a book focusing on the growing number of polluting vehicles in the world . " but we need something more technology forcing , which stimulates innovations , " sperling , a transportation expert , told the dpa news agency , adding that the economy would benefit . in his own field , he said , new , cleaner cars would create more jobs . " you can lower costs , create jobs and reduce lethal overheating , " said baird , using his preferred term in place of climate change , " and put money back in the pockets of consumers . " hopes were pinned on the new us administration taking the steps to make it happen . " if we turn climate change into an opportunity , it is the biggest opportunity since world war two , " said josefsson , referring to the economic expansion that was brought about as a result of the war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most german academics prefer to publish in english as well as making it easier to speak with foreign colleagues , german academics also prefered english over their native language when it comes to publishing their work , the council said .
it therefore called for the increased promotion of scientific publications in german .
the council admitted its concern over the future of the language , saying that the loss of scientific german could lead to a loss at scientific thinking , because " science thinking is connected to language and culture . "
the fear was , it added , that german as an international scientific language could suffer in the long term .
" upholding the scientific german language has nothing to do with protectionism or nationalism , " olaf zimmermann , the council secretary , said .
" on the contrary , it concerns the security of cultural diversity and cultural self-sufficiency . "
zimmermann called for more funding of the arts , where german was still a significant language .
he demanded that all academic conferences held in germany be conducted in both english and german , not english alone .

in science today , only one percent of the papers published are in german , the council said .
an increasing number of foreign academics coming to germany for research or conference purposes add to the pressure on german scientists to present and work in english , as many visitors arrive with very basic or no german skills .
the council said that foreign guest professors coming to germany to teach or to join research institutes were " under the impression they do not need to learn german , because english will do . "
this was because a knowledge of german was not necessary in order to be able to communicate in universities and non-university research establishments with german colleagues .
most german academics prefer to publish in english as well as making it easier to speak with foreign colleagues , german academics also prefered english over their native language when it comes to publishing their work , the council said .
it therefore called for the increased promotion of scientific publications in german .
the council admitted its concern over the future of the language , saying that the loss of scientific german could lead to a loss at scientific thinking , because " science thinking is connected to language and culture . "
the fear was , it added , that german as an international scientific language could suffer in the long term .
" upholding the scientific german language has nothing to do with protectionism or nationalism , " olaf zimmermann , the council secretary , said .
" on the contrary , it concerns the security of cultural diversity and cultural self-sufficiency . "
zimmermann called for more funding of the arts , where german was still a significant language .

in science today , only one percent of the papers published are in german , the council said .
an increasing number of foreign academics coming to germany for research or conference purposes add to the pressure on german scientists to present and work in english , as many visitors arrive with very basic or no german skills .
the council said that foreign guest professors coming to germany to teach or to join research institutes were " under the impression they do not need to learn german , because english will do . "
this was because a knowledge of german was not necessary in order to be able to communicate in universities and non-university research establishments with german colleagues .
most german academics prefer to publish in english as well as making it easier to speak with foreign colleagues , german academics also prefered english over their native language when it comes to publishing their work , the council said .
it therefore called for the increased promotion of scientific publications in german .
the council admitted its concern over the future of the language , saying that the loss of scientific german could lead to a loss at scientific thinking , because " science thinking is connected to language and culture . "
the fear was , it added , that german as an international scientific language could suffer in the long term .
" upholding the scientific german language has nothing to do with protectionism or nationalism , " olaf zimmermann , the council secretary , said .
" on the contrary , it concerns the security of cultural diversity and cultural self-sufficiency . "
zimmermann called for more funding of the arts , where german was still a significant language .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 31.01.2009 mixture of support and skepticism for obama in davos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama entered office with the promise of change .
some say its time for action despite the absence of cabinet members of the new us administration at the world economic forum , president obama is all the talk in davos .
can he reverse the ailing economy and restore america 's role in the world ? predictions of the imminent decline of the us as the major global power are nothing new .
back in 1988 , the late samuel huntington wrote a long essay about what he described as the fifth way of declinism since the 1950 's .
then , as now , economic and military factors were the major factors why many perceived the us to be on a slow but steady downward spiral as a great power .
however , there are many stark differences between 1998 and 2008 and 2009 that make it difficult to compare the periods , for example , the demise of the soviet union and the rise of islamic extremism , and most importantly , globalization .
us a constant topic in davos with the world in the midst of the biggest economic crisis since the great depression , what are the chances that the us under its new president barack obama can master the situation , and how will the us and the world be changed through this crisis ?
this is a question that is being discussed almost incessantly at the world economic forum in davos .
of course , the subject is not addressed as such , but it is the theme that runs as an undercurrent through almost any small talk or debate .
and while all the latest economic indicators signal more doom and gloom for the world 's biggest economy - house prices decline by almost 20 percent , durable goods orders decline for the fifth month in a row , unemployment skyrocketing - the amount of respect and hope business and government leaders from around the world place on president barack obama to turn the u.s. economy around and restore the country 's stature in the world is astonishing .
" i am a huge fan of barack obama , " says klaas kersting , ceo of gameforge ag , a german online gaming start-up .
" i think he had a really good start of turning things around to bring the u.s. out of its moral crisis . "
african roots a factor for obama 's popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa , and kenya in particular , have high hopes for obama arthur mutambara , deputy prime minister of zimbabwe for the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , cites a different reason why he believes president obama can bring about the change he promised during his election campaign : " being of african extraction , being a son of a kenyan , yes , he has the potential to do it .
what it requires is the confidence and the courage to do so . "
while president obama won international praise for some of the early decisions he made right after taking office , linda lorimer , vice president of yale university , makes a different argument : " i think the steps they took before the inauguration are even more important than what they have done in the first days of the administration , which is have a sense of prospect and promise .
i think those of us here who are in business or academia know that leadership today is about teamwork .
america needs to assert its leadership by showing it is part of the team of leading countries in the world and no longer is a go-it-alone kind of enterprise . "
listen , do n't patronise the sentiment expressed by lorimer that the us should again engage and cooperate with other nations is also common theme in davos .
" barack obama must make sure that on africa he listens to africans and not to come to africa and patronise africa , " says zimbabwe 's deputy prime minister mutambara .
" we in africa know what is good for ourselves and americans and the international community must listen to us not the other way around . "
even iran 's foreign minister said here in davos that his country was ready to respond if america 's policy change was genuine .
while barack obama and his administration appear to have plenty of goodwill , trust and support from around the world , the question is whether that is enough .
according to all major indicators , the economic situation in the us looks so grim that a quick way out of the misery seems all but impossible . hard struggle ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and his team face huge challenges however , even a self-declared obama fan like gameforge ceo kersting turns pessimistic when being asked about a prediction whether the new administration can reverse the downward trend .
" the economic challenges are dramatic .
the us economy is significantly suffering - finance , automotive and all the suppliers for that matter .
it is really a very big challenge and countries like china or india do n't sleep ; they grow in these times of crisis .
they grow slowly , but they still grow , so i think it is going to be a hard struggle for obama to turn this around . "
at this point , no one here in davos or anywhere else for that matter appears to know how and when america 's economy will come out of the crisis .
so what does that mean for people around the world who are waiting for president obama to fulfill his promise to bring change to the world ? " we ca n't possibly expect one person to solve all the ills that all of us are looking at , " says yale vice president lorimer and adds : " we have to hope that his very able team reaching out to the very able leadership around the world will find the right course of action .

some say its time for action despite the absence of cabinet members of the new us administration at the world economic forum , president obama is all the talk in davos .
can he reverse the ailing economy and restore america 's role in the world ? predictions of the imminent decline of the us as the major global power are nothing new .
back in 1988 , the late samuel huntington wrote a long essay about what he described as the fifth way of declinism since the 1950 's .
then , as now , economic and military factors were the major factors why many perceived the us to be on a slow but steady downward spiral as a great power .
however , there are many stark differences between 1998 and 2008 and 2009 that make it difficult to compare the periods , for example , the demise of the soviet union and the rise of islamic extremism , and most importantly , globalization .
us a constant topic in davos with the world in the midst of the biggest economic crisis since the great depression , what are the chances that the us under its new president barack obama can master the situation , and how will the us and the world be changed through this crisis ?
this is a question that is being discussed almost incessantly at the world economic forum in davos .
of course , the subject is not addressed as such , but it is the theme that runs as an undercurrent through almost any small talk or debate .
and while all the latest economic indicators signal more doom and gloom for the world 's biggest economy - house prices decline by almost 20 percent , durable goods orders decline for the fifth month in a row , unemployment skyrocketing - the amount of respect and hope business and government leaders from around the world place on president barack obama to turn the u.s. economy around and restore the country 's stature in the world is astonishing .
" i am a huge fan of barack obama , " says klaas kersting , ceo of gameforge ag , a german online gaming start-up .
" i think he had a really good start of turning things around to bring the u.s. out of its moral crisis . "
african roots a factor for obama 's popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa , and kenya in particular , have high hopes for obama arthur mutambara , deputy prime minister of zimbabwe for the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , cites a different reason why he believes president obama can bring about the change he promised during his election campaign : " being of african extraction , being a son of a kenyan , yes , he has the potential to do it .
what it requires is the confidence and the courage to do so . "
while president obama won international praise for some of the early decisions he made right after taking office , linda lorimer , vice president of yale university , makes a different argument : " i think the steps they took before the inauguration are even more important than what they have done in the first days of the administration , which is have a sense of prospect and promise .
i think those of us here who are in business or academia know that leadership today is about teamwork .
america needs to assert its leadership by showing it is part of the team of leading countries in the world and no longer is a go-it-alone kind of enterprise . "
listen , do n't patronise the sentiment expressed by lorimer that the us should again engage and cooperate with other nations is also common theme in davos .
" barack obama must make sure that on africa he listens to africans and not to come to africa and patronise africa , " says zimbabwe 's deputy prime minister mutambara .
" we in africa know what is good for ourselves and americans and the international community must listen to us not the other way around . "
even iran 's foreign minister said here in davos that his country was ready to respond if america 's policy change was genuine .
while barack obama and his administration appear to have plenty of goodwill , trust and support from around the world , the question is whether that is enough .
according to all major indicators , the economic situation in the us looks so grim that a quick way out of the misery seems all but impossible . hard struggle ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and his team face huge challenges however , even a self-declared obama fan like gameforge ceo kersting turns pessimistic when being asked about a prediction whether the new administration can reverse the downward trend .
" the economic challenges are dramatic .
the us economy is significantly suffering - finance , automotive and all the suppliers for that matter .
it is really a very big challenge and countries like china or india do n't sleep ; they grow in these times of crisis .
they grow slowly , but they still grow , so i think it is going to be a hard struggle for obama to turn this around . "
at this point , no one here in davos or anywhere else for that matter appears to know how and when america 's economy will come out of the crisis .
so what does that mean for people around the world who are waiting for president obama to fulfill his promise to bring change to the world ? " we ca n't possibly expect one person to solve all the ills that all of us are looking at , " says yale vice president lorimer and adds : " we have to hope that his very able team reaching out to the very able leadership around the world will find the right course of action .

in germany 's general election set for september 27 , the country 's troop presence in afghanistan , opposed by the majority of german citizens , is likely to be high on the agenda .
german chancellor angela merkel , presiding over a coalition government between her conservative cdu party and the spd on the left , has been instrumental in committing troops to the nato mission in afghanistan .
however the country 's foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , who is the spd 's election candidate , is critical of further troop deployment .
president of the federal police agency -lrb- bka -rrb- joerg ziercke warned that terrorists could attempt to influence the election outcome , similar to the madrid train bomb-attacks ahead of the spanish elections in 2004 .
" we are seeing clear parallels to the situation in spain , " zierke said in an interview with weekly news magazine focus .
parallels with spanish attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain suffered europe 's worst terror attack in 2004 ahead of spain 's 2004 elections , attacks on madrid 's commuter trains , in which 191 people died , achieved their aim of bringing about a change of government and a withdrawal of spanish troops from the us-led coalition in iraq .
bka-chief zierke said that radical converts to islam of german origin were especially dangerous .
" they know the german infrastructure , are socially integrated and hardly stand out because of their appearance . "
in the past weeks at least two videos have surfaced in which threats have been issued in german against countries with a military presence in afghanistan .

"
pope benedict xvi 's pardon of williamson , along with three other ultra-conservative bishops , has threatened the vatican 's relationship with jewish leaders and led to an outburst of criticism within the catholic church .
two weeks ago , in an interview with swedish state television , williamson said " historical evidence is hugely against 6 million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on jan .

heavy burden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson has apologized to the pope for " distress " caused by his " imprudent " comments the president of germany 's jewish central committee , charlotte knobloch , made it clear on friday that the vatican 's decision weighed heavily on the relationship between jews and catholics .
in light of the pope 's german nationality , knobloch said she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . "
former chief rabbi israel meir lau , a survivor of buchenwald concentration camp , was quoted in spiegel asking , " how can such a liar be granted the protection and pardon of the leader of the catholic church ? "
german catholics protest german catholics have also reacted strongly to benedict 's decision .
in the city of muenster , where the pope once taught as a professor of theology , almost the entire catholic faculty signed a letter of protest , while theologians in the city of tuebingen described the decision as a " heavy burden " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of catholics have been disappointed by the pope swiss theologian hans kueng , speaking on german radio rbb , accused benedict of being out of touch with his " kingdom " .
in kueng 's words , " the pope has no critical people around him . "
in light of this wave of reactions , the vatican has sought to quell the outrage .
during his weekly general audience on wednesday , benedict said the memory of the holocaust can not be cancelled through any form of denial .
the german-born pontiff also recalled his own past pilgrimages to the former nazi death camp of auschwitz .
" the images i collected during my numerous visits to auschwitz bore witness to the innocent victims of a racial hatred , " he said .
questioning the church ?
spiegel reported that some german catholics are questioning their adherence to the church .
helmut reinhard , a catholic living in the city of munich , lost 15 members of his family in auschwitz-birkenau , " all of them gypsies , " he told the magazine , " and all of them catholic . "
as a result of the pope 's pardon , reinhard 's brother markus had left the catholic church , together with his wife and her four sisters , on holocaust memorial day .
now he too has had enough , he told the magazine , and was renouncing his membership .

" this may even lead to a un economic council , just as the security council was created after world war ii , " she told the world economic forum 's annual meeting in switzerland . she also called on governments to take responsibility for their economies and flex greater control of the markets . " the state is the guardian of the economic and social order so it has a very clear role .

this must not be allowed to last too long because they inevitably lead to some distortion and are , quite frankly , protectionist . " safeguarding the environment and reducing the poverty gap were also principles that merkel says " need to be enshrined in the form of a global economic order charter " that " could lead to the establishment of a un economic council . " merkel 's proposal is an expansion on british prime minister gordon brown 's call to update the 1944 bretton woods structure that established the world bank and international monetary fund , which are now being used to bail out countries during the financial crisis . the british leader warned earlier in the day against financial protectionism that would lead to " a retreat of globalization and a reduction of trade and cross-border activity , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's gordon brown and angela merkel brown will host the group of 20 leaders summit of major developed and emerging nations outside london in april .

"
pope benedict xvi 's pardon of williamson , along with three other ultra-conservative bishops , has threatened the vatican 's relationship with jewish leaders and led to an outburst of criticism within the catholic church .
two weeks ago , in an interview with swedish state television , williamson said " historical evidence is hugely against 6 million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on jan .
27 .
heavy burden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson has apologized to the pope for " distress " caused by his " imprudent " comments the president of germany 's jewish central committee , charlotte knobloch , made it clear on friday that the vatican 's decision weighed heavily on the relationship between jews and catholics .
in light of the pope 's german nationality , knobloch said she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . "
former chief rabbi israel meir lau , a survivor of buchenwald concentration camp , was quoted in spiegel asking , " how can such a liar be granted the protection and pardon of the leader of the catholic church ? "
german catholics protest german catholics have also reacted strongly to benedict 's decision .
in the city of muenster , where the pope once taught as a professor of theology , almost the entire catholic faculty signed a letter of protest , while theologians in the city of tuebingen described the decision as a " heavy burden " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of catholics have been disappointed by the pope swiss theologian hans kueng , speaking on german radio rbb , accused benedict of being out of touch with his " kingdom " .
in kueng 's words , " the pope has no critical people around him . "
in light of this wave of reactions , the vatican has sought to quell the outrage .
during his weekly general audience on wednesday , benedict said the memory of the holocaust can not be cancelled through any form of denial .
the german-born pontiff also recalled his own past pilgrimages to the former nazi death camp of auschwitz .
" the images i collected during my numerous visits to auschwitz bore witness to the innocent victims of a racial hatred , " he said .

" this may even lead to a un economic council , just as the security council was created after world war ii , " she told the world economic forum 's annual meeting in switzerland . she also called on governments to take responsibility for their economies and flex greater control of the markets . " the state is the guardian of the economic and social order so it has a very clear role .
competition is necessary but it is something that also needs a certain discipline and principles , " she said . " freedom is a necessary precondition for market forces to operate .

this must not be allowed to last too long because they inevitably lead to some distortion and are , quite frankly , protectionist . " safeguarding the environment and reducing the poverty gap were also principles that merkel says " need to be enshrined in the form of a global economic order charter " that " could lead to the establishment of a un economic council . " merkel 's proposal is an expansion on british prime minister gordon brown 's call to update the 1944 bretton woods structure that established the world bank and international monetary fund , which are now being used to bail out countries during the financial crisis . the british leader warned earlier in the day against financial protectionism that would lead to " a retreat of globalization and a reduction of trade and cross-border activity , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's gordon brown and angela merkel brown will host the group of 20 leaders summit of major developed and emerging nations outside london in april .

munich appeared superhuman in a 5-1 cup rout on tuesday at vfb stuttgart , but all their ambitions froze on a cold friday when they were beaten 1-0 by hamburg in the bundesliga restart .
mladen petric 's winner shortly before halftime made sure that hamburg and not munich moved to the top of the standings -lrb- at least until later saturday -rrb- to the delight of the 57,000-strong crowd .
instead of starting a planned winning streak to take the league by storm munich 's inconsistency prevailed in their third season defeat .
" everyone believed that no one could stop them , but then came hamburg , " said the bild daily on saturday .
" petric punishes stupid bayern .
my god , what chances did the record champions waste last night . "
bayern 's expensive stars out of sorts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni had a frustrating time in front of goal friday the reigning champions munich were lethargic in the first half and then unable to find the net , with luca toni even missing from point blank range .
bayern complained that toni 's first half goal should have not been disallowed for an alleged push of bastian reinhardt .
but bayern were also lucky when petric and piotr trochowski were denied by the post .
" we are angry and disappointed because we go home empty-handed .
we wasted too many chances , " said munich coach juergen klinsmann .
chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said : " maybe we thought after the good game -lrb- in stuttgart -rrb- that we would only require a half-hearted effort .
but you ca n't afford that against any team , and definitely not against hamburg . "
while toni was the man to blame up front it took french star franck ribery a long time to show his class as well .
ribery was accused of arrogance when he chipped a penalty right into the arms of goalkeeper jens lehmann in the cup match and on friday former munich great mehmet scholl , speaking on ard television , bluntly told the frenchman to get his own act together instead of calling for the signing of new players .
" he should n't forget where he was two years ago .
he was playing in the middle of nowhere at marseille , " said scholl .
title race blown open by munich loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery needs to rediscover his form and desire in the run-in nothing is lost for munich in a close title race which also features hibernation period leaders tsg hoffenheim , bayer leverkusen and possibly hertha berlin .
but failing to impress the rivals early on will hurt the success-hungry top club .
their inability to find the net even generated another title rival in hamburg , whose coach martin jol delighted in an " incredible game . "

" the protestant church of st. martin in waldlaubersheim is one of 33 such churches located alongside germany 's famous autobahns , an institution which celebrated 50 years in a ceremony in a church on the a8 in adelsried in 2008 .
more than 1 million people visit them every year . these houses of worship invite people to seek " relaxation , refuge and contemplation . "
the churches are " rest stops for the soul , " according to the website autobahnkirche.info maintained by the bruderhilfe pastoral organization in kassel . highway chapels curb road rage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stopping at an autobahn church may ease traffic-jam tension " drivers who stop at an autobahn church tend to continue their journey in a more relaxed manner and are more considerate to other road-users which goes to show that a visit contributes to road safety , " the custodians of the church write . yet what qualifies a church to be an autobahn chapel ?
" it must be close to a motorway exit and stay open the whole day , " said birgit krause who works for the bruderhilfe . although the autobahn churches maintain no firm links with each other , their pastors do meet once a year to exchange ideas .
most of the chapels are protestant , but the doors are open to worshippers of all confessions , said krause . many of the churches are remote from rural communities , yet damage or vandalism is no more of a problem than it is elsewhere .
" people are coming in and out the whole time which acts as a check on anti-social behavior . " until 1991 , st. martin 's church was a house of worship for people from waldlaubersheim until a local vineyard owner came up with the idea of turning it into an autobahn chapel . drivers just want simple rituals " he was on the road a lot in his car delivering wine and knew how stressful driving can be , " explained pastor joachim deserno .
" in the beginning , we racked our brains over all the things we would need to provide for visitors until it suddenly occurred to us - they do n't actually want much . " the guestbook is an important feature along with a leaflet containing a blessing for each visitor .
drivers can also write down their prayers , wishes and concerns on slips of paper and attach them to a large wooden crucifix .
candles can be lit in a corner next to the altar while to the rear of the transept , below the handsome old organ , stands a table with toys and books for children . bildunterschrift : autobahn churches are especially popular with the elderly " that has come in use for local services too , " said deserno . experts from the catholic university of applied sciences in freiburg found in a survey that a typical visitor to an autobahn chapel is at least 50 years old , with men churchgoers outnumbering women . a study of 400 questionnaires also revealed that two-thirds of visitors come in from the road not just to rest but to pray , light a candle or take part in a religious service .

30 . piebalgs spoke of unity after german chancellor angela merkel asked the 27-member bloc to support the nord stream pipeline , which would bring russian natural gas under the baltic sea directly to germany . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country chairs the eu until june 30 , said tuesday that nord stream , as a pipeline deepening the eu 's reliance on russian gas , was " a direct threat to the nabucco project " that would skip russia as a supplier . speaking to reporters at an energy security conference in the northeastern czech city of ostrava , piebalgs said that the eu has backed nord stream as " one of the alternative routes . " " there is an agreement on this pipeline .
it is not controversial , " piebalgs said , adding that germany also supports nabucco as germany 's gas firm rwe is a member of its consortium . " the difference of opinion is not -lrb- as -rrb- big as people feel .
the eu is rather united on this pipeline policy , " he told reporters . topolanek , also present at the energy meeting , declined to comment on merkel 's letter . poland , baltic states biggest opponents poland and the baltic states have been the chief opponents of the nord stream pipeline , which bypasses them . piebalgs said that while poland would prefer other routes , warsaw was " not hostile " to the russian-german line .
" nobody says we do not need additional gas supplies to germany or the netherlands , " he said . playing down topolanek 's previous statements , czech vice-premier for european affairs alexandr vondra said that europe 's growing demand for gas would make use of both pipelines . the nord stream and nabucco pipelines , which would bring gas from the caspian via turkey , " are not in competition , " he said . the european commission on wednesday proposed 250 million euros for nabucco but the eight-billion-euro project faces hurdles despite the backing . the eu is yet to strike a transit deal with turkey and competes for nabucco 's supply in the caspian with russia , which offered central asian countries market-level prices . " our chance is that each and every producer also looks for diversification , " piebalgs said . the eu backs nabucco over a south stream pipeline that would carry russian gas to italy under the black sea and via greece . " we take note of it but definitely nabucco is most important for us because it brings not only new source ... but it also brings a new route , " the commissioner said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 31.01.2009 world leaders at davos call for climate to remain in focus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world faces environmental as well as economic pressures with the economic crisis likely to dominate much of 2009 , world leaders in davos urged climate change issues to remain in focus . prime minister gordon brown , german chancellor angela merkel , the un 's secretary general ban ki-moon and others attending the world economic forum warned against letting the economic worries overshadow the need to solve the climate issues as the two were interconnected .
brown said that climate change would feature prominently at the next g20 meeting in april as it was " essential to recovery of the world economy . "
" the main obstacle during 2009 on the road to copenhagen may be the financial crisis , " said danish prime minister anders rasmussen .
in december , representatives of most countries will gather in copenhagen , denmark and attempt to knock out a new climate deal , but some environmentalists have expressed concern that not enough will be done before then to enable the nations to reach an agreement .
" we have to get it right in copenhagen , there is no second chance here , " said yvo de boer , head of the un 's framework convention on climate change .
" we must decide to put a price on carbon , " said al gore , the former us vice president , adding that president barack obama would play a positive role in combating climate change .
" he is pushing hard for dramatic and bold moves in the right direction , " said gore , noting that the house of representatives had passed a stimulus bill , " the largest component of which is a green stimulus . "
" we must appreciate the magnitude of change in united state 's leadership , " said gore .
the previous administration in washington , dc , was accused of hindering attempts to reach agreements on climate change .
alternative energy sources as economic benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts at davos say alternative energy can help the economy panelists at sessions in davos said alternative energies , to replace oil , coal and other sources of power which emit carbon dioxide and create pollution , would also have economic advantages and help spur the economy , and could be an essential part of spurring the world out of the downturn .
ban compared advancing green technologies to " killing two birds with one stone . "
reaching the goals in copenhagen , rasmussen said , would require industrialized and developing nations to work together to set reduction targets .
carbon trading seen as a way forward with the issues of climate change and the global economic crisis coming to a head simultaneously , world leaders have focused on tying the two together , and businessmen saturday were trying to find ways to make money from a green economy . europe 's carbon credit trading program , in its second phase , is seen as being on the path to putting a price on pollution and creating a market that would allow for profit making . " pricing and cost will force a lot of adjustment for people , " said pierre lagrange , an alternative energy investor , but added that a trading program " could only work if it were globally accepted . " he said europe 's politicians have expressed interest in setting more aggressive carbon reduction goals , if the rest of the world got on board . with the 192 countries planning to meet in december in copenhagen , in attempt to reach a new global climate deal , engaging with developing nations will be crucial to the outcome of the process . scheme plans to trade carbon like currency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries could trade carbon credits like currency capping carbon emissions would force producers who exceed their permitted output amounts to buy credits from companies who have not , creating new jobs in the new market and also reducing carbon outputs by attaching a price to it . to get people trading across borders , lars josefsson , from the large european power producer vattenfall , suggested treating the credits in each country - which would each likely introduce its own system - like currency exchanges , which let people with one brand of cash do business with someone with another . " this is a pragmatic way to go about globalizing cap and trade markets , " he said , referring to the markets to cap or limit carbon emissions by trading them . ultimately , lagrange said , the caps on emissions will have to be extended to the user , and not only to the energy producer . " the place to start is behavior change , " said us congressman brian baird .
" the goal should be 20 per cent reduction in 20 weeks .
just walk through your daily life and see how much you can reduce . " " energy efficiency is very doable , and 50 per cent of the solution , " said nic frances , who runs a company which focuses on reducing power consumption .
" it 's what we do in our homes , domestic energy efficiency . " fears of greedy exploitation of carbon trading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing electric and hybrid cars would create jobs concerns though have been made that carbon trading would lead to yet another market which could be used for profit without bringing about the needed improvements to the environment , while also it would inhibit the creation of new technologies and instead focusing on cleaning up the old ones . " cap and trade is fine , " said daniel sperling , an author of two billion cars , a book focusing on the growing number of polluting vehicles in the world . " but we need something more technology forcing , which stimulates innovations , " sperling , a transportation expert , told the dpa news agency , adding that the economy would benefit . in his own field , he said , new , cleaner cars would create more jobs . " you can lower costs , create jobs and reduce lethal overheating , " said baird , using his preferred term in place of climate change , " and put money back in the pockets of consumers . " hopes were pinned on the new us administration taking the steps to make it happen . " if we turn climate change into an opportunity , it is the biggest opportunity since world war two , " said josefsson , referring to the economic expansion that was brought about as a result of the war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 31.01.2009 world leaders at davos call for climate to remain in focus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world faces environmental as well as economic pressures with the economic crisis likely to dominate much of 2009 , world leaders in davos urged climate change issues to remain in focus . prime minister gordon brown , german chancellor angela merkel , the un 's secretary general ban ki-moon and others attending the world economic forum warned against letting the economic worries overshadow the need to solve the climate issues as the two were interconnected .
brown said that climate change would feature prominently at the next g20 meeting in april as it was " essential to recovery of the world economy . "
" the main obstacle during 2009 on the road to copenhagen may be the financial crisis , " said danish prime minister anders rasmussen .
in december , representatives of most countries will gather in copenhagen , denmark and attempt to knock out a new climate deal , but some environmentalists have expressed concern that not enough will be done before then to enable the nations to reach an agreement .
" we have to get it right in copenhagen , there is no second chance here , " said yvo de boer , head of the un 's framework convention on climate change .
" we must decide to put a price on carbon , " said al gore , the former us vice president , adding that president barack obama would play a positive role in combating climate change .
" he is pushing hard for dramatic and bold moves in the right direction , " said gore , noting that the house of representatives had passed a stimulus bill , " the largest component of which is a green stimulus . "
" we must appreciate the magnitude of change in united state 's leadership , " said gore .
the previous administration in washington , dc , was accused of hindering attempts to reach agreements on climate change .
alternative energy sources as economic benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts at davos say alternative energy can help the economy panelists at sessions in davos said alternative energies , to replace oil , coal and other sources of power which emit carbon dioxide and create pollution , would also have economic advantages and help spur the economy , and could be an essential part of spurring the world out of the downturn .
ban compared advancing green technologies to " killing two birds with one stone . "
reaching the goals in copenhagen , rasmussen said , would require industrialized and developing nations to work together to set reduction targets .
carbon trading seen as a way forward with the issues of climate change and the global economic crisis coming to a head simultaneously , world leaders have focused on tying the two together , and businessmen saturday were trying to find ways to make money from a green economy . europe 's carbon credit trading program , in its second phase , is seen as being on the path to putting a price on pollution and creating a market that would allow for profit making . " pricing and cost will force a lot of adjustment for people , " said pierre lagrange , an alternative energy investor , but added that a trading program " could only work if it were globally accepted . " he said europe 's politicians have expressed interest in setting more aggressive carbon reduction goals , if the rest of the world got on board . with the 192 countries planning to meet in december in copenhagen , in attempt to reach a new global climate deal , engaging with developing nations will be crucial to the outcome of the process . scheme plans to trade carbon like currency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries could trade carbon credits like currency capping carbon emissions would force producers who exceed their permitted output amounts to buy credits from companies who have not , creating new jobs in the new market and also reducing carbon outputs by attaching a price to it . to get people trading across borders , lars josefsson , from the large european power producer vattenfall , suggested treating the credits in each country - which would each likely introduce its own system - like currency exchanges , which let people with one brand of cash do business with someone with another . " this is a pragmatic way to go about globalizing cap and trade markets , " he said , referring to the markets to cap or limit carbon emissions by trading them . ultimately , lagrange said , the caps on emissions will have to be extended to the user , and not only to the energy producer . " the place to start is behavior change , " said us congressman brian baird .
" the goal should be 20 per cent reduction in 20 weeks .
just walk through your daily life and see how much you can reduce . " " energy efficiency is very doable , and 50 per cent of the solution , " said nic frances , who runs a company which focuses on reducing power consumption .
" it 's what we do in our homes , domestic energy efficiency . " fears of greedy exploitation of carbon trading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing electric and hybrid cars would create jobs concerns though have been made that carbon trading would lead to yet another market which could be used for profit without bringing about the needed improvements to the environment , while also it would inhibit the creation of new technologies and instead focusing on cleaning up the old ones . " cap and trade is fine , " said daniel sperling , an author of two billion cars , a book focusing on the growing number of polluting vehicles in the world . " but we need something more technology forcing , which stimulates innovations , " sperling , a transportation expert , told the dpa news agency , adding that the economy would benefit . in his own field , he said , new , cleaner cars would create more jobs . " you can lower costs , create jobs and reduce lethal overheating , " said baird , using his preferred term in place of climate change , " and put money back in the pockets of consumers . " hopes were pinned on the new us administration taking the steps to make it happen . " if we turn climate change into an opportunity , it is the biggest opportunity since world war two , " said josefsson , referring to the economic expansion that was brought about as a result of the war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 31.01.2009 world leaders at davos call for climate to remain in focus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world faces environmental as well as economic pressures with the economic crisis likely to dominate much of 2009 , world leaders in davos urged climate change issues to remain in focus . prime minister gordon brown , german chancellor angela merkel , the un 's secretary general ban ki-moon and others attending the world economic forum warned against letting the economic worries overshadow the need to solve the climate issues as the two were interconnected .
brown said that climate change would feature prominently at the next g20 meeting in april as it was " essential to recovery of the world economy . "
" the main obstacle during 2009 on the road to copenhagen may be the financial crisis , " said danish prime minister anders rasmussen .
in december , representatives of most countries will gather in copenhagen , denmark and attempt to knock out a new climate deal , but some environmentalists have expressed concern that not enough will be done before then to enable the nations to reach an agreement .
" we have to get it right in copenhagen , there is no second chance here , " said yvo de boer , head of the un 's framework convention on climate change .
" we must decide to put a price on carbon , " said al gore , the former us vice president , adding that president barack obama would play a positive role in combating climate change .
" he is pushing hard for dramatic and bold moves in the right direction , " said gore , noting that the house of representatives had passed a stimulus bill , " the largest component of which is a green stimulus . "
" we must appreciate the magnitude of change in united state 's leadership , " said gore .
the previous administration in washington , dc , was accused of hindering attempts to reach agreements on climate change .
alternative energy sources as economic benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts at davos say alternative energy can help the economy panelists at sessions in davos said alternative energies , to replace oil , coal and other sources of power which emit carbon dioxide and create pollution , would also have economic advantages and help spur the economy , and could be an essential part of spurring the world out of the downturn .
ban compared advancing green technologies to " killing two birds with one stone . "
reaching the goals in copenhagen , rasmussen said , would require industrialized and developing nations to work together to set reduction targets .
carbon trading seen as a way forward with the issues of climate change and the global economic crisis coming to a head simultaneously , world leaders have focused on tying the two together , and businessmen saturday were trying to find ways to make money from a green economy . europe 's carbon credit trading program , in its second phase , is seen as being on the path to putting a price on pollution and creating a market that would allow for profit making . " pricing and cost will force a lot of adjustment for people , " said pierre lagrange , an alternative energy investor , but added that a trading program " could only work if it were globally accepted . " he said europe 's politicians have expressed interest in setting more aggressive carbon reduction goals , if the rest of the world got on board . with the 192 countries planning to meet in december in copenhagen , in attempt to reach a new global climate deal , engaging with developing nations will be crucial to the outcome of the process . scheme plans to trade carbon like currency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries could trade carbon credits like currency capping carbon emissions would force producers who exceed their permitted output amounts to buy credits from companies who have not , creating new jobs in the new market and also reducing carbon outputs by attaching a price to it . to get people trading across borders , lars josefsson , from the large european power producer vattenfall , suggested treating the credits in each country - which would each likely introduce its own system - like currency exchanges , which let people with one brand of cash do business with someone with another . " this is a pragmatic way to go about globalizing cap and trade markets , " he said , referring to the markets to cap or limit carbon emissions by trading them . ultimately , lagrange said , the caps on emissions will have to be extended to the user , and not only to the energy producer . " the place to start is behavior change , " said us congressman brian baird .
" the goal should be 20 per cent reduction in 20 weeks .
just walk through your daily life and see how much you can reduce . " " energy efficiency is very doable , and 50 per cent of the solution , " said nic frances , who runs a company which focuses on reducing power consumption .
" it 's what we do in our homes , domestic energy efficiency . " fears of greedy exploitation of carbon trading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing electric and hybrid cars would create jobs concerns though have been made that carbon trading would lead to yet another market which could be used for profit without bringing about the needed improvements to the environment , while also it would inhibit the creation of new technologies and instead focusing on cleaning up the old ones . " cap and trade is fine , " said daniel sperling , an author of two billion cars , a book focusing on the growing number of polluting vehicles in the world . " but we need something more technology forcing , which stimulates innovations , " sperling , a transportation expert , told the dpa news agency , adding that the economy would benefit . in his own field , he said , new , cleaner cars would create more jobs . " you can lower costs , create jobs and reduce lethal overheating , " said baird , using his preferred term in place of climate change , " and put money back in the pockets of consumers . " hopes were pinned on the new us administration taking the steps to make it happen . " if we turn climate change into an opportunity , it is the biggest opportunity since world war two , " said josefsson , referring to the economic expansion that was brought about as a result of the war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

munich appeared superhuman in a 5-1 cup rout on tuesday at vfb stuttgart , but all their ambitions froze on a cold friday when they were beaten 1-0 by hamburg in the bundesliga restart .
mladen petric 's winner shortly before halftime made sure that hamburg and not munich moved to the top of the standings -lrb- at least until later saturday -rrb- to the delight of the 57,000-strong crowd .
instead of starting a planned winning streak to take the league by storm munich 's inconsistency prevailed in their third season defeat .
" everyone believed that no one could stop them , but then came hamburg , " said the bild daily on saturday .
" petric punishes stupid bayern .
my god , what chances did the record champions waste last night . "
bayern 's expensive stars out of sorts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni had a frustrating time in front of goal friday the reigning champions munich were lethargic in the first half and then unable to find the net , with luca toni even missing from point blank range .
bayern complained that toni 's first half goal should have not been disallowed for an alleged push of bastian reinhardt .
but bayern were also lucky when petric and piotr trochowski were denied by the post .
" we are angry and disappointed because we go home empty-handed .
we wasted too many chances , " said munich coach juergen klinsmann .
chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said : " maybe we thought after the good game -lrb- in stuttgart -rrb- that we would only require a half-hearted effort .
but you ca n't afford that against any team , and definitely not against hamburg . "
while toni was the man to blame up front it took french star franck ribery a long time to show his class as well .
ribery was accused of arrogance when he chipped a penalty right into the arms of goalkeeper jens lehmann in the cup match and on friday former munich great mehmet scholl , speaking on ard television , bluntly told the frenchman to get his own act together instead of calling for the signing of new players .
" he should n't forget where he was two years ago .

"
pope benedict xvi 's pardon of williamson , along with three other ultra-conservative bishops , has threatened the vatican 's relationship with jewish leaders and led to an outburst of criticism within the catholic church .
two weeks ago , in an interview with swedish state television , williamson said " historical evidence is hugely against 6 million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on jan .
27 .
heavy burden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson has apologized to the pope for " distress " caused by his " imprudent " comments the president of germany 's jewish central committee , charlotte knobloch , made it clear on friday that the vatican 's decision weighed heavily on the relationship between jews and catholics .
in light of the pope 's german nationality , knobloch said she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . "
former chief rabbi israel meir lau , a survivor of buchenwald concentration camp , was quoted in spiegel asking , " how can such a liar be granted the protection and pardon of the leader of the catholic church ? "
german catholics protest german catholics have also reacted strongly to benedict 's decision .
in the city of muenster , where the pope once taught as a professor of theology , almost the entire catholic faculty signed a letter of protest , while theologians in the city of tuebingen described the decision as a " heavy burden " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of catholics have been disappointed by the pope swiss theologian hans kueng , speaking on german radio rbb , accused benedict of being out of touch with his " kingdom " .
in kueng 's words , " the pope has no critical people around him . "
in light of this wave of reactions , the vatican has sought to quell the outrage .
during his weekly general audience on wednesday , benedict said the memory of the holocaust can not be cancelled through any form of denial .
the german-born pontiff also recalled his own past pilgrimages to the former nazi death camp of auschwitz .
" the images i collected during my numerous visits to auschwitz bore witness to the innocent victims of a racial hatred , " he said .
questioning the church ?
spiegel reported that some german catholics are questioning their adherence to the church .
helmut reinhard , a catholic living in the city of munich , lost 15 members of his family in auschwitz-birkenau , " all of them gypsies , " he told the magazine , " and all of them catholic . "
as a result of the pope 's pardon , reinhard 's brother markus had left the catholic church , together with his wife and her four sisters , on holocaust memorial day .
now he too has had enough , he told the magazine , and was renouncing his membership .
german public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his remarks .

president barack obama stands for change , but one white house practice endures : appointing non-career diplomats to plum postings abroad . within his first two days in office , president barack obama named richard holbrooke and george mitchell as special envoys to the world 's hot spots and the senate unanimously confirmed susan rice as us ambassador to the united nations .
now obama will need to fill the top diplomatic posts in prestigious world capitals such as london , paris , moscow and tokyo as well as the sunny caribbean .
although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .
“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .
and now that caroline kennedy , an early obama supporter , has withdrawn from the new york senate race , the british national newspapers are even speculating that jfk 's daughter could follow the steps of her grandfather joseph p. kennedy as us ambassador in london . holbrooke served in newly reunified germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy 's grandfather was us ambassador to britain germany too has had its share of distinguished us ambassadors , who have been heavy hitters in foreign policy arena : walter stoessel had been us ambassador to the soviet union and interim secretary of state in 1982 ; vernon walters , a former un ambassador and deputy cia chief , was renowned for his linguistic prowess ; john kornblum , a career diplomat , had played a key role in the east-west détente that led to the end of the cold war , and richard holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan .
such an illustrious precedent has made the last two bush appointees — dan coats , an indiana senator and william timken , an ohio industrialist , both who speak no german , look somewhat pale in comparison .
joerg duppler , berlin director of the atlantic treaty association , who knows timken , feels that us-german ties are so close that who the american ambassador is has little impact on bilateral relations anyway .
“ timken did his job well .
he represented his president .
his job was n't to be popular with germans , ” said duppler . the devil who wears prada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wintour was the inspiration behind " devil wears prada " one of europe 's most coveted posts is paris , where two recent american ambassadors were hugely popular with the french elite . in a country where benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson once served , british-born pamela churchill harriman was long on pedigree , but short on experience .
linked by marriage to some of the most powerful men of the 20th century , harriman , a big fundraiser for the democratic party , had served during former president bill clinton 's first term .
her successor was felix rohatyn , the lazard freres investment banker , who had rescued new york city from bankruptcy in the 1970s .
“ they could n't have been more different , but were each very effective in their own way .
she was the socialite star ; he was the business intellectual star .
then there was arthur hartman , that rare career diplomat , who was a true professional .
the rest you do n't remember , " said ifri 's moisi . rumor has it that another american with a british accent could become obama 's ambassador to france .
fashion icon anna wintour , the editor of vogue magazine , hosted fundraisers for obama and got some big names behind his campaign .
moisi was amused by the thought that wintour , who reportedly inspired the chick lit novel " the devil wears prada " could be up for paris .

fashion icon anna wintour for paris ?
president barack obama stands for change , but one white house practice endures : appointing non-career diplomats to plum postings abroad . within his first two days in office , president barack obama named richard holbrooke and george mitchell as special envoys to the world 's hot spots and the senate unanimously confirmed susan rice as us ambassador to the united nations .
now obama will need to fill the top diplomatic posts in prestigious world capitals such as london , paris , moscow and tokyo as well as the sunny caribbean .
although all us ambassadors officially resigned by january 20 when obama took the oath of office , the career diplomats serving in so-called “ hardship posts ” in the malaria belt , are likely keep their jobs . plum postings for big donors the plum assignments that cover most of europe however , routinely go to presidential appointees as a reward for their donations to campaign coffers , says edward peck , a former chief of mission to iraq under the carter administration .
“ a president can pick whoever he wants , ” said peck of the political patronage that results in one-third of all ambassadorships going to non-career diplomats , making the united states an anomaly among industrial nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamela harriman was ambassador to france although presidential nominees are subject to senate approval , all but the most outrageously incompetent are routinely confirmed .
political appointments run the gamut from elder statesmen and academics with long washington experience to generous business donors or show biz icons , such as shirley temple .
peck added that there have been some “ extraordinarily gifted , popular and charming ” political ambassadors , but they never understood the operational side of the business .
he named john kenneth galbraith , an intellectual heavyweight and star economist of the kennedy administration who nevertheless understood next to nothing about running an embassy . while galbraith was highly respected in india even though " he did n't know the work of an ambassador " , another political appointee helene von damm , was embarrassing for the americans . this thrice-married personal secretary to ronald reagan was posted to vienna and became a darling of the tabloids when she had a very public love affair with a dashing younger man .
when she left her american husband for an austrian national , some in washington saw a conflict and forced her resignation .
no change under obama but the white house practice of awarding the most coveted posts to non-diplomats is not about to change under obama , according to michael cotter , who ended his career as ambassador to turkmenistan in the late 1990s . although obama told the state department earlier this month that his " general inclination " was to fill posts with professional diplomats from the us foreign service " wherever possible , " he made clear he would not abandon the presidential practice of making some political appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan “ obama also has political debts to pay off , so he 's going to put those big donors who are less qualified in the not-too-important posts like the bahamas and fiji , ” said cotter .
“ the better qualified will go to europe , ” he added .
the routine practice of giving the most coveted posts in europe to political appointees is demoralizing for career officers , a damper for attracting top talent to the foreign service , in the view of dominique moisi , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris .
“ the highest office you can reach is a small embassy in some distant land , ” said moisi .
“ this is bad for the morale of the us diplomatic corps . ” us ambassador to sweden : the best ever for europeans on the other hand , whether the us president 's personal emissary abroad comes from the white house or foggy bottom hardly matters .
what counts is whether their country 's top american diplomat is effective or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandalous love affair forced von damm 's resignation " just because someone does n't hail from the foreign service does n't make him a bad ambassador , " said thomas kleine-brockhoff , a senior policy director for the german marshall fund , a group that promotes trans-atlantic relations .
" someone from the business world can be superb for the job , " he added , pointing out that the swedes regard michael wood , a media executive and friend of former president george w. bush , as the best american ambassador they 've ever had for his work in promoting swedish-us cooperation in alternative energy technology .
a tribute in newsweek magazine had hailed wood , who just left , as “ one point of light in bush 's environmental legacy . ”
on the other hand , bush appointments to the most prestigious ambassadorship of all , at the court of st. james in london , have disappointed the british public . uk appointees : horse breeder and auto dealer william s. farish iii , a texas multi-millionaire horse breeder who is best known for giving the bushes the white house dog named millie , “ operated below the radar , ” said michael cox , a transatlantic expert at the london think tank chatham house .
“ he appeared to be very inactive during the time of the iraq war , a time when the bush administration needed someone to articulate us policy in public .
and language is n't a problem here , ” said cox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galbraith was a hugely popular ambassador farish 's successor robert h. tuttle , a partner in a beverly hills automobile dealership , became best known for exercising his diplomatic immunity in refusing to pay the london congestion charge . tuttle , who also worked for six years under former us president ronald regan , said the charge amounted to a tax on diplomatic missions , which is prohibited by international diplomatic convention .
several other embassies in london have also refused to pay the charge . the mayor of london at the time , ken livingston claimed that other embassies paid up and called tuttle the “ venal little crook ” for not coughing up the 1.5 million pounds -lrb- us $ 2.1 million , 1.7 million euros -rrb- he owed the city . it did n't used to be like this .
the court of st. james had been previously occupied by five ambassadors who went on to become us president and distinguished public servants who held cabinet posts such as averill harriman , david bruce and elliot richardson .
prominent business moguls such as walter annenberg even earned an honorary knighthood from the queen for his support of royal causes .
and now that caroline kennedy , an early obama supporter , has withdrawn from the new york senate race , the british national newspapers are even speculating that jfk 's daughter could follow the steps of her grandfather joseph p. kennedy as us ambassador in london . holbrooke served in newly reunified germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kennedy 's grandfather was us ambassador to britain germany too has had its share of distinguished us ambassadors , who have been heavy hitters in foreign policy arena : walter stoessel had been us ambassador to the soviet union and interim secretary of state in 1982 ; vernon walters , a former un ambassador and deputy cia chief , was renowned for his linguistic prowess ; john kornblum , a career diplomat , had played a key role in the east-west détente that led to the end of the cold war , and richard holbrooke is now obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan .

some say its time for action despite the absence of cabinet members of the new us administration at the world economic forum , president obama is all the talk in davos .
can he reverse the ailing economy and restore america 's role in the world ? predictions of the imminent decline of the us as the major global power are nothing new .
back in 1988 , the late samuel huntington wrote a long essay about what he described as the fifth way of declinism since the 1950 's .
then , as now , economic and military factors were the major factors why many perceived the us to be on a slow but steady downward spiral as a great power .
however , there are many stark differences between 1998 and 2008 and 2009 that make it difficult to compare the periods , for example , the demise of the soviet union and the rise of islamic extremism , and most importantly , globalization .
us a constant topic in davos with the world in the midst of the biggest economic crisis since the great depression , what are the chances that the us under its new president barack obama can master the situation , and how will the us and the world be changed through this crisis ?
this is a question that is being discussed almost incessantly at the world economic forum in davos .
of course , the subject is not addressed as such , but it is the theme that runs as an undercurrent through almost any small talk or debate .
and while all the latest economic indicators signal more doom and gloom for the world 's biggest economy - house prices decline by almost 20 percent , durable goods orders decline for the fifth month in a row , unemployment skyrocketing - the amount of respect and hope business and government leaders from around the world place on president barack obama to turn the u.s. economy around and restore the country 's stature in the world is astonishing .
" i am a huge fan of barack obama , " says klaas kersting , ceo of gameforge ag , a german online gaming start-up .
" i think he had a really good start of turning things around to bring the u.s. out of its moral crisis . "
african roots a factor for obama 's popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa , and kenya in particular , have high hopes for obama arthur mutambara , deputy prime minister of zimbabwe for the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , cites a different reason why he believes president obama can bring about the change he promised during his election campaign : " being of african extraction , being a son of a kenyan , yes , he has the potential to do it .
what it requires is the confidence and the courage to do so . "
while president obama won international praise for some of the early decisions he made right after taking office , linda lorimer , vice president of yale university , makes a different argument : " i think the steps they took before the inauguration are even more important than what they have done in the first days of the administration , which is have a sense of prospect and promise .
i think those of us here who are in business or academia know that leadership today is about teamwork .
america needs to assert its leadership by showing it is part of the team of leading countries in the world and no longer is a go-it-alone kind of enterprise . "
listen , do n't patronise the sentiment expressed by lorimer that the us should again engage and cooperate with other nations is also common theme in davos .
" barack obama must make sure that on africa he listens to africans and not to come to africa and patronise africa , " says zimbabwe 's deputy prime minister mutambara .
" we in africa know what is good for ourselves and americans and the international community must listen to us not the other way around . "
even iran 's foreign minister said here in davos that his country was ready to respond if america 's policy change was genuine .
while barack obama and his administration appear to have plenty of goodwill , trust and support from around the world , the question is whether that is enough .
according to all major indicators , the economic situation in the us looks so grim that a quick way out of the misery seems all but impossible . hard struggle ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and his team face huge challenges however , even a self-declared obama fan like gameforge ceo kersting turns pessimistic when being asked about a prediction whether the new administration can reverse the downward trend .
" the economic challenges are dramatic .
the us economy is significantly suffering - finance , automotive and all the suppliers for that matter .
it is really a very big challenge and countries like china or india do n't sleep ; they grow in these times of crisis .
they grow slowly , but they still grow , so i think it is going to be a hard struggle for obama to turn this around . "
at this point , no one here in davos or anywhere else for that matter appears to know how and when america 's economy will come out of the crisis .
so what does that mean for people around the world who are waiting for president obama to fulfill his promise to bring change to the world ? " we ca n't possibly expect one person to solve all the ills that all of us are looking at , " says yale vice president lorimer and adds : " we have to hope that his very able team reaching out to the very able leadership around the world will find the right course of action .

30 . piebalgs spoke of unity after german chancellor angela merkel asked the 27-member bloc to support the nord stream pipeline , which would bring russian natural gas under the baltic sea directly to germany . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country chairs the eu until june 30 , said tuesday that nord stream , as a pipeline deepening the eu 's reliance on russian gas , was " a direct threat to the nabucco project " that would skip russia as a supplier . speaking to reporters at an energy security conference in the northeastern czech city of ostrava , piebalgs said that the eu has backed nord stream as " one of the alternative routes . " " there is an agreement on this pipeline .
it is not controversial , " piebalgs said , adding that germany also supports nabucco as germany 's gas firm rwe is a member of its consortium . " the difference of opinion is not -lrb- as -rrb- big as people feel .
the eu is rather united on this pipeline policy , " he told reporters . topolanek , also present at the energy meeting , declined to comment on merkel 's letter . poland , baltic states biggest opponents poland and the baltic states have been the chief opponents of the nord stream pipeline , which bypasses them . piebalgs said that while poland would prefer other routes , warsaw was " not hostile " to the russian-german line .
" nobody says we do not need additional gas supplies to germany or the netherlands , " he said . playing down topolanek 's previous statements , czech vice-premier for european affairs alexandr vondra said that europe 's growing demand for gas would make use of both pipelines . the nord stream and nabucco pipelines , which would bring gas from the caspian via turkey , " are not in competition , " he said . the european commission on wednesday proposed 250 million euros for nabucco but the eight-billion-euro project faces hurdles despite the backing . the eu is yet to strike a transit deal with turkey and competes for nabucco 's supply in the caspian with russia , which offered central asian countries market-level prices . " our chance is that each and every producer also looks for diversification , " piebalgs said . the eu backs nabucco over a south stream pipeline that would carry russian gas to italy under the black sea and via greece . " we take note of it but definitely nabucco is most important for us because it brings not only new source ... but it also brings a new route , " the commissioner said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in science today , only one percent of the papers published are in german , the council said .
an increasing number of foreign academics coming to germany for research or conference purposes add to the pressure on german scientists to present and work in english , as many visitors arrive with very basic or no german skills .
the council said that foreign guest professors coming to germany to teach or to join research institutes were " under the impression they do not need to learn german , because english will do . "
this was because a knowledge of german was not necessary in order to be able to communicate in universities and non-university research establishments with german colleagues .
most german academics prefer to publish in english as well as making it easier to speak with foreign colleagues , german academics also prefered english over their native language when it comes to publishing their work , the council said .
it therefore called for the increased promotion of scientific publications in german .
the council admitted its concern over the future of the language , saying that the loss of scientific german could lead to a loss at scientific thinking , because " science thinking is connected to language and culture . "
the fear was , it added , that german as an international scientific language could suffer in the long term .
" upholding the scientific german language has nothing to do with protectionism or nationalism , " olaf zimmermann , the council secretary , said .
" on the contrary , it concerns the security of cultural diversity and cultural self-sufficiency . "
zimmermann called for more funding of the arts , where german was still a significant language .
he demanded that all academic conferences held in germany be conducted in both english and german , not english alone .
" it should be natural therefore that during international conferences in germany , german should be one of the working languages . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 . piebalgs spoke of unity after german chancellor angela merkel asked the 27-member bloc to support the nord stream pipeline , which would bring russian natural gas under the baltic sea directly to germany . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country chairs the eu until june 30 , said tuesday that nord stream , as a pipeline deepening the eu 's reliance on russian gas , was " a direct threat to the nabucco project " that would skip russia as a supplier . speaking to reporters at an energy security conference in the northeastern czech city of ostrava , piebalgs said that the eu has backed nord stream as " one of the alternative routes . " " there is an agreement on this pipeline .
it is not controversial , " piebalgs said , adding that germany also supports nabucco as germany 's gas firm rwe is a member of its consortium . " the difference of opinion is not -lrb- as -rrb- big as people feel .
the eu is rather united on this pipeline policy , " he told reporters . topolanek , also present at the energy meeting , declined to comment on merkel 's letter . poland , baltic states biggest opponents poland and the baltic states have been the chief opponents of the nord stream pipeline , which bypasses them . piebalgs said that while poland would prefer other routes , warsaw was " not hostile " to the russian-german line .
" nobody says we do not need additional gas supplies to germany or the netherlands , " he said . playing down topolanek 's previous statements , czech vice-premier for european affairs alexandr vondra said that europe 's growing demand for gas would make use of both pipelines . the nord stream and nabucco pipelines , which would bring gas from the caspian via turkey , " are not in competition , " he said . the european commission on wednesday proposed 250 million euros for nabucco but the eight-billion-euro project faces hurdles despite the backing . the eu is yet to strike a transit deal with turkey and competes for nabucco 's supply in the caspian with russia , which offered central asian countries market-level prices . " our chance is that each and every producer also looks for diversification , " piebalgs said . the eu backs nabucco over a south stream pipeline that would carry russian gas to italy under the black sea and via greece . " we take note of it but definitely nabucco is most important for us because it brings not only new source ... but it also brings a new route , " the commissioner said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 . piebalgs spoke of unity after german chancellor angela merkel asked the 27-member bloc to support the nord stream pipeline , which would bring russian natural gas under the baltic sea directly to germany . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country chairs the eu until june 30 , said tuesday that nord stream , as a pipeline deepening the eu 's reliance on russian gas , was " a direct threat to the nabucco project " that would skip russia as a supplier . speaking to reporters at an energy security conference in the northeastern czech city of ostrava , piebalgs said that the eu has backed nord stream as " one of the alternative routes . " " there is an agreement on this pipeline .
it is not controversial , " piebalgs said , adding that germany also supports nabucco as germany 's gas firm rwe is a member of its consortium . " the difference of opinion is not -lrb- as -rrb- big as people feel .
the eu is rather united on this pipeline policy , " he told reporters . topolanek , also present at the energy meeting , declined to comment on merkel 's letter . poland , baltic states biggest opponents poland and the baltic states have been the chief opponents of the nord stream pipeline , which bypasses them . piebalgs said that while poland would prefer other routes , warsaw was " not hostile " to the russian-german line .
" nobody says we do not need additional gas supplies to germany or the netherlands , " he said . playing down topolanek 's previous statements , czech vice-premier for european affairs alexandr vondra said that europe 's growing demand for gas would make use of both pipelines . the nord stream and nabucco pipelines , which would bring gas from the caspian via turkey , " are not in competition , " he said . the european commission on wednesday proposed 250 million euros for nabucco but the eight-billion-euro project faces hurdles despite the backing . the eu is yet to strike a transit deal with turkey and competes for nabucco 's supply in the caspian with russia , which offered central asian countries market-level prices . " our chance is that each and every producer also looks for diversification , " piebalgs said . the eu backs nabucco over a south stream pipeline that would carry russian gas to italy under the black sea and via greece . " we take note of it but definitely nabucco is most important for us because it brings not only new source ... but it also brings a new route , " the commissioner said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

grenadier guard scott blaney , 22 , also suffered shrapnel wounds to his right arm and eye in the explosion in may 2007 .

" i spent a day in -lsb- camp -rsb- bastion where i got my leg amputated then i was flown back to the uk .
" i was in hospital for about six weeks and i walked soon after , about a month later . "
he has always refused to become depressed by his injuries .
" it 's a squaddie mentality - you ca n't feel sorry for yourself , you have to get on with things .
" i came to terms quite a long time ago -lsb- with what -rsb- has happened to me but i 've never been down about it , i 've turned it in to positives .

monmouthshire council said it plans to move to the usk campus of coleg gwent and the campus will in turn relocate to a new purpose-built building .
monmouthshire and torfaen councils have been looking for new homes since it emerged it would cost £ 30m to repair their shared county hall in cwmbran .
coleg gwent said the relocation proposal was good news .
the college will share its headquarters at the usk campus with the local authority .
the campus itself , which delivers a selection of sport and land-based courses , will shift to a site opposite its current location in a new building .
steve greenslade , monmouthshire council corporate director , said : " the bill for repairing the existing council headquarters would be over £ 30m and even then would be a very inefficient and costly building to run .
this is good news for both coleg gwent and the council coleg gwent principal howard burton " the new combined hq with coleg gwent would represent a cost effective solution within the county , incorporating many energy efficient measures , helping to reduce our carbon footprint . "
it was revealed 18 months ago that both local authorities would vacate the 1960s cwmbran building which faced being condemned .
it is understood monmouthshire now plans to move out of the existing hq by 2012 .
councillor peter fox , the council leader , also said they were " delighted that we are able to work in partnership with coleg gwent " .
" this helps us both to reduce costs and , from monmouthshire 's point of view , will be a much cheaper solution than to pay for the essential structural repairs to the existing county hall . "
estates strategy he added : " this scheme allows both parties to maximise operating efficiencies as well as ensuring that sustainable principles are adopted throughout the life of this building . "
college principal howard burton said : " this is good news for both coleg gwent and the council .
" the proposed plans will enable the college to build a new campus with fit-for-purpose resources to benefit staff and students .
" the plans will also enable us to further progress phase one of the estates strategy , which aims to provide the college with facilities that fully meet the expectations and needs for academic and vocational training . "
the development is subject to planning permission and approval from the welsh assembly government .
meanwhile , torfaen council has been looking at alternative schemes like home working to accommodate some of its headquarters staff and is also looking to see if it can set up a private sector partnership to provide a new base .
a spokesman said both councils have already done some preliminary work on a protocol that would bring structure to their arrangements to vacate county hall and they " remain committed to work together to ensure a smooth transition " .

monmouthshire council said it plans to move to the usk campus of coleg gwent and the campus will in turn relocate to a new purpose-built building .
monmouthshire and torfaen councils have been looking for new homes since it emerged it would cost £ 30m to repair their shared county hall in cwmbran .
coleg gwent said the relocation proposal was good news .
the college will share its headquarters at the usk campus with the local authority .
the campus itself , which delivers a selection of sport and land-based courses , will shift to a site opposite its current location in a new building .
steve greenslade , monmouthshire council corporate director , said : " the bill for repairing the existing council headquarters would be over £ 30m and even then would be a very inefficient and costly building to run .
this is good news for both coleg gwent and the council coleg gwent principal howard burton " the new combined hq with coleg gwent would represent a cost effective solution within the county , incorporating many energy efficient measures , helping to reduce our carbon footprint . "
it was revealed 18 months ago that both local authorities would vacate the 1960s cwmbran building which faced being condemned .
it is understood monmouthshire now plans to move out of the existing hq by 2012 .
councillor peter fox , the council leader , also said they were " delighted that we are able to work in partnership with coleg gwent " .
" this helps us both to reduce costs and , from monmouthshire 's point of view , will be a much cheaper solution than to pay for the essential structural repairs to the existing county hall . "
estates strategy he added : " this scheme allows both parties to maximise operating efficiencies as well as ensuring that sustainable principles are adopted throughout the life of this building . "
college principal howard burton said : " this is good news for both coleg gwent and the council .
