the vatican says it did not know enough about the bishop 's past and both sides now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit to jerusalem 's yad vashem memorial to holocaust victims .
most jewish leaders now consider the episode to have been put to rest - but not all .
the dorot hemeshech association of holocaust survivors has called on drivers to blow their car horns during the pope 's speech at yad vashem .
" israelis will this way express their disapproval of the pope who encourages holocaust denial and anti-semitism , " the association said .
the german-born pontiff 's membership in the hitler youth , although it was forced , has also angered holocaust survivors .
in addition , a group of far-right activists has said they plan to press criminal charges against the pope over vatican treasures they claim were plundered from jewish people , while nitzan horowitz , a gay rights activist and a left-wing parliamentarian , will boycott all official ceremonies held for the pope .
" pope benedict xvi is responsible for the suffering of thousands of people in the world , " horowitz said .
" he conveys a message of extremism and insensitivity , " he added , referring to a papal warning that condom use could be aggravating africa 's aids crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pm netanyahu has not yet endorsed the idea of a palestinian state pope to meet israeli and palestinian leaders during his five-day visit , pope benedict will hold talks with israeli and palestinian leaders .
he is expected to repeat his offer for the catholic church to do all it can to help the stalled peace process .
the vatican supports a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which also has internationally backing .
pope benedict will be welcomed by israeli president shimon peres and the country 's new , right-leaning prime minister , benjamin netanyahu .
since being sworn in to power at the end of march , netanyahu has so far refused to publicly endorse the creation of a palestinian state .
he did , however , say on sunday that israel will try to ease restrictions on palestinians in the west bank .
" i think we need to make a big effort , within the given security constraints , to make things easier for the palestinians , " netanyahu reportedly told ministers during a cabinet meeting .
after welcoming the pope , prime minister netanyahu heads to egypt , on his first trip to the arab world since he took office .
egypt is looking for netanyahu to support and endorse palestinian independence .
meanwhile , the united nations security council is holding talks on monday , to also revive the stalled middle east peace process . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin , who chairs the 15-member security council this month , called the meeting to stress the " urgency of reaching comprehensive peace in the middle east .

" under the constitution , the gsg 9 is responsible for these kind of eventualities , but really , it should be the military 's duty .
for them to do this duty , though , we have to lay the legal foundations , and that means changing the constitution , " schaeuble said in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble , pushing for constitutional change the minister said it was decided to send the gsg 9 to africa because the bundeswehr alone could n't come up with the necessary resources to carry out a hostage liberation at sea .
shortly before the planned operation could take place , consultations with the officer in command led to its cancellation .
before the gsg 9 could reach the scene , the kidnappers had brought the ship into port .

the weekly magazine der spiegel tells the story somewhat differently .

on top of that , they say there were conflicts between the gsg 9 and the bundeswehr .
the gsg 9 are better trained for hostage operations than the military 's special forces , but for the transport abroad they depended on the army .

following an aborted action by germany 's elite anti-terrorism police unit , the gsg 9 , to free a kidnapped freighter in somalia , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble wants to broaden the mandate of the bundeswehr . by a constitutional change the german military would be made responsible for an area which has until now been the province of the police .
" under the constitution , the gsg 9 is responsible for these kind of eventualities , but really , it should be the military 's duty .
for them to do this duty , though , we have to lay the legal foundations , and that means changing the constitution , " schaeuble said in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble , pushing for constitutional change the minister said it was decided to send the gsg 9 to africa because the bundeswehr alone could n't come up with the necessary resources to carry out a hostage liberation at sea .
shortly before the planned operation could take place , consultations with the officer in command led to its cancellation .
before the gsg 9 could reach the scene , the kidnappers had brought the ship into port .
the situation became much more dangerous , as more pirates had gone aboard and the risk that police or hostages could be killed in an operation became too high .
the weekly magazine der spiegel tells the story somewhat differently .
the magazine says a gsg 9 dress rehearsal aboard the us helicopter ship " boxer " was a success , but at the last minute the us withdrew support for the operation .
der spiegel also blamed coordination difficulties between the operational commander and high command in berlin .
on top of that , they say there were conflicts between the gsg 9 and the bundeswehr .
the gsg 9 are better trained for hostage operations than the military 's special forces , but for the transport abroad they depended on the army .
schaeuble said the constitutional changes he has recommended are provided for under the coalition agreement between the christian democratic union and the social democratic party , but he criticized that the social democrats have so far blocked the changes . ch / ai , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is very little room for tax cuts and no one can say right now when the time will be right , " schaeuble said .
" new tax revenue estimates due later in may will show just how limited the scope for tax relief is . "
berlin is expected to slash its tax revenue estimates for 2009 by 48 billion euros -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- later this week .
however , chancellor merkel is sticking to her pledge .
in an interview on german public television , she said that tax relief could help the stimulate sluggish german economy .
" we need to mobilize all our forces to foster growth , " she said .
merkel is promising a three-pronged approach of tax relief , deficit cuts and investment in education and innovation .
schaeuble 's doubts echoed the difference in opinion does n't end with schaeuble .
several cdu state premiers had already criticized her plans to make tax relief a key plank of the party 's election campaign program .
the cdu premier of thuringia , dieter althaus , also said this weekend that his party had an obligation to be a guarantor of solid state finances .
horst seehofer , the head of the cdu 's sister party in bavaria , the christian social union , also raised his doubts .
" one is not allowed to make promises that one ca n't keep to , " he said .
the divisions over the tax issue could hurt merkel in september 's election , despite her current lead of 10 points over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , her partners in government .
merkel had been hoping she would coast to re-election this year on her economic record and the promise of tax cuts .
things look rather different now , however , as the global financial crisis has plunged germany into its deepest recession since world war ii and the economic and fiscal gains from her first three years in office now just a distant memory . cg / jk , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following an aborted action by germany 's elite anti-terrorism police unit , the gsg 9 , to free a kidnapped freighter in somalia , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble wants to broaden the mandate of the bundeswehr . by a constitutional change the german military would be made responsible for an area which has until now been the province of the police .
" under the constitution , the gsg 9 is responsible for these kind of eventualities , but really , it should be the military 's duty .
for them to do this duty , though , we have to lay the legal foundations , and that means changing the constitution , " schaeuble said in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble , pushing for constitutional change the minister said it was decided to send the gsg 9 to africa because the bundeswehr alone could n't come up with the necessary resources to carry out a hostage liberation at sea .
shortly before the planned operation could take place , consultations with the officer in command led to its cancellation .
before the gsg 9 could reach the scene , the kidnappers had brought the ship into port .
the situation became much more dangerous , as more pirates had gone aboard and the risk that police or hostages could be killed in an operation became too high .
the weekly magazine der spiegel tells the story somewhat differently .
the magazine says a gsg 9 dress rehearsal aboard the us helicopter ship " boxer " was a success , but at the last minute the us withdrew support for the operation .
der spiegel also blamed coordination difficulties between the operational commander and high command in berlin .
on top of that , they say there were conflicts between the gsg 9 and the bundeswehr .
the gsg 9 are better trained for hostage operations than the military 's special forces , but for the transport abroad they depended on the army .
schaeuble said the constitutional changes he has recommended are provided for under the coalition agreement between the christian democratic union and the social democratic party , but he criticized that the social democrats have so far blocked the changes . ch / ai , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is very little room for tax cuts and no one can say right now when the time will be right , " schaeuble said .
" new tax revenue estimates due later in may will show just how limited the scope for tax relief is . "
berlin is expected to slash its tax revenue estimates for 2009 by 48 billion euros -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- later this week .
however , chancellor merkel is sticking to her pledge .
in an interview on german public television , she said that tax relief could help the stimulate sluggish german economy .
" we need to mobilize all our forces to foster growth , " she said .
merkel is promising a three-pronged approach of tax relief , deficit cuts and investment in education and innovation .
schaeuble 's doubts echoed the difference in opinion does n't end with schaeuble .
several cdu state premiers had already criticized her plans to make tax relief a key plank of the party 's election campaign program .
the cdu premier of thuringia , dieter althaus , also said this weekend that his party had an obligation to be a guarantor of solid state finances .
horst seehofer , the head of the cdu 's sister party in bavaria , the christian social union , also raised his doubts .
" one is not allowed to make promises that one ca n't keep to , " he said .
the divisions over the tax issue could hurt merkel in september 's election , despite her current lead of 10 points over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , her partners in government .
merkel had been hoping she would coast to re-election this year on her economic record and the promise of tax cuts .
things look rather different now , however , as the global financial crisis has plunged germany into its deepest recession since world war ii and the economic and fiscal gains from her first three years in office now just a distant memory . cg / jk , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following an aborted action by germany 's elite anti-terrorism police unit , the gsg 9 , to free a kidnapped freighter in somalia , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble wants to broaden the mandate of the bundeswehr . by a constitutional change the german military would be made responsible for an area which has until now been the province of the police .
" under the constitution , the gsg 9 is responsible for these kind of eventualities , but really , it should be the military 's duty .
for them to do this duty , though , we have to lay the legal foundations , and that means changing the constitution , " schaeuble said in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble , pushing for constitutional change the minister said it was decided to send the gsg 9 to africa because the bundeswehr alone could n't come up with the necessary resources to carry out a hostage liberation at sea .
shortly before the planned operation could take place , consultations with the officer in command led to its cancellation .
before the gsg 9 could reach the scene , the kidnappers had brought the ship into port .
the situation became much more dangerous , as more pirates had gone aboard and the risk that police or hostages could be killed in an operation became too high .
the weekly magazine der spiegel tells the story somewhat differently .
the magazine says a gsg 9 dress rehearsal aboard the us helicopter ship " boxer " was a success , but at the last minute the us withdrew support for the operation .
der spiegel also blamed coordination difficulties between the operational commander and high command in berlin .
on top of that , they say there were conflicts between the gsg 9 and the bundeswehr .
the gsg 9 are better trained for hostage operations than the military 's special forces , but for the transport abroad they depended on the army .
schaeuble said the constitutional changes he has recommended are provided for under the coalition agreement between the christian democratic union and the social democratic party , but he criticized that the social democrats have so far blocked the changes . ch / ai , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is very little room for tax cuts and no one can say right now when the time will be right , " schaeuble said .
" new tax revenue estimates due later in may will show just how limited the scope for tax relief is . "
berlin is expected to slash its tax revenue estimates for 2009 by 48 billion euros -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- later this week .
however , chancellor merkel is sticking to her pledge .
in an interview on german public television , she said that tax relief could help the stimulate sluggish german economy .
" we need to mobilize all our forces to foster growth , " she said .
merkel is promising a three-pronged approach of tax relief , deficit cuts and investment in education and innovation .
schaeuble 's doubts echoed the difference in opinion does n't end with schaeuble .
several cdu state premiers had already criticized her plans to make tax relief a key plank of the party 's election campaign program .
the cdu premier of thuringia , dieter althaus , also said this weekend that his party had an obligation to be a guarantor of solid state finances .
horst seehofer , the head of the cdu 's sister party in bavaria , the christian social union , also raised his doubts .
" one is not allowed to make promises that one ca n't keep to , " he said .
the divisions over the tax issue could hurt merkel in september 's election , despite her current lead of 10 points over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , her partners in government .
merkel had been hoping she would coast to re-election this year on her economic record and the promise of tax cuts .
things look rather different now , however , as the global financial crisis has plunged germany into its deepest recession since world war ii and the economic and fiscal gains from her first three years in office now just a distant memory . cg / jk , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " iron men " - as they are popularly known - have gained notoriety over the past 11 months as their unique fans have been tranforming their old stadium into a modern soccer arena .
" this is the most unique experience of my career , " sylvia weisheit told dw radio .
weisheit , who has been a die-hard union berlin fan for the past three decades , is the manager of the stadium construction project .
" the fans spend their free time and holidays working at the constuction site .
they are totally committed to the community , and any company would be glad to have such workers . "
the middle-aged blonde is one of only about six to 10 professional builders at the site .
the rest of the 60 to 80 workers turning up each morning at 7 a.m. are union supporters .
iron men with an iron will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union fans toil for club glory since construction of the new stadium began last june , around 1,600 volunteers have put in an estimated 90,000 hours of work .
they have saved the club two million euros from the overall construction costs of 15 million euros .
the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- had threatend to close the club ’ s old forestry stadium , which dates back to the 1920s .
dfb offcials said it no longer met the security requirements of professional soccer in germany .
michael - or " kibi " as he likes to be known - said the dfb 's decision was a test of union supporters unique fan culture .
describing the club as a big family bound together by more than just football he said : " union is a social event .
we ’ ve got the spirit of a neighborhood club where everyone sticks together . "
the stadium construction project was proof , he said , that it is possible to combine " commercial soccer with preserving the club 's century-old tradition . "
iron men defy odds and oppression fc union berlin was founded in 1906 by metalworkers in the industrial district of koepenick in the east of the city .
union supporters ‘ rapturous chant " eisern union " - meaning " iron union " - first echoed through the old forestry stadium in the 1920s .
after world war two , berlin was divided and union berlin played in the leagues of the then communist east germany .
union berlin enjoyed cult status as the club of non-conformists and of all east berliners opposing the regime .
their eternal rivals in the city were bfc dynamo , a club run by the dreaded stasi secret police .
" they had a lot of money and they had the best players , " recalls thommy thiele , an union fan since he was 13 years old .
" we hated the bfc dynamo , we hated the secret service , we hated the berlin wall , we were in opposition to the state , " he told dw radio .
" that ’ s why in the 1980s there were over 20,000 people in the fc union stadium every match and only 5,000 people at bfc dynamo . "
after german unification in 1990 , fc union berlin experienced difficult economic times in professional soccer .
the club frequently hovered on the brink of insolvency .
there were fan protests at berlin ’ s brandenburg gate to force the city government to transform the stadium into club property .
in 2004 , union supporters donated blood to earn enough funds for the club to get dfb approval to play the next season .
new stadium ushers in new era those trying days have forged the club together , the fans say .
" the manager , the president , the coach , the team and the supporters make up a whole system , " says thommy thiele .
" dirk zingler , our president , was standing in the stadium behind me 20 years ago .
he is one of us , a part of the family . "
while the hard-working fans sweat it out on the stadium terraces , they can watch the players give their all on the training ground right next door .
to see the new oval rise from the rubble of the old stadium has been a huge boost for the team ’ s morale , said club coach uwe neuhaus .
" the team is well aware of the close bonds within the club .
this is something special and is currently being underscored by the fans very impressively . "
on saturday , coach neuhaus and the team paid back their debt to the fans by clinching promotion to the second division .
ironically , the victory came in the stadium of the hated bfc dynamo , where the team has played throughout the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union player macchambes younga-mouhani -lrb- 2.v.r -rrb- scores opening goal against jahn regensburg promotion to the second bundesliga ushers in new challenges for union berlin , said thommy thiele .
but even if the club will have to struggle commercially , as well as on the pitch , the iron-willed union community can never be broken up .
" we have to maintain our spirit .
we have a lot of common people in our community and there is not a lot of money .
in the third division , the second division , the first division or the fourth division , i don ’ t care .

tui managed to post a first-quarter profit germany 's biggest tourism group , tui , posted a first quarter profit despite weak travel activities , crediting the sale of a part of its stake in the hapag-lloyd shipping unit . the german travel giant said gains on the sale of a stake in hapag-lloyd pushed it to a 415 million euro -lrb- $ 565 million -rrb- first-quarter net profit .
but sales were 15 percent lower .
the gain for the january-march period compared with a net loss of 279 million euros in the first quarter of 2008 , tui said .
sales for the period , however , fell 15 percent to 3.1 billion euros from 3.6 billion euros in the first-quarter of last year , as fewer people vacationed during the recession .
tui brought in 990 million euros in the quarter from the sale of a stake of its hapag-lloyd marine division to a consortium of investors , including the city of hamburg .
for 2009 as a whole , the company predicted sales would keep falling .
but the overall result " is expected to be positive and improve considerably year-on-year , " in part owing to the container-shipping sale and decreased integration costs in its tourism division . jen / ncy , ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " iron men " - as they are popularly known - have gained notoriety over the past 11 months as their unique fans have been tranforming their old stadium into a modern soccer arena .
" this is the most unique experience of my career , " sylvia weisheit told dw radio .
weisheit , who has been a die-hard union berlin fan for the past three decades , is the manager of the stadium construction project .
" the fans spend their free time and holidays working at the constuction site .
they are totally committed to the community , and any company would be glad to have such workers . "
the middle-aged blonde is one of only about six to 10 professional builders at the site .
the rest of the 60 to 80 workers turning up each morning at 7 a.m. are union supporters .
iron men with an iron will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union fans toil for club glory since construction of the new stadium began last june , around 1,600 volunteers have put in an estimated 90,000 hours of work .
they have saved the club two million euros from the overall construction costs of 15 million euros .
the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- had threatend to close the club ’ s old forestry stadium , which dates back to the 1920s .
dfb offcials said it no longer met the security requirements of professional soccer in germany .
michael - or " kibi " as he likes to be known - said the dfb 's decision was a test of union supporters unique fan culture .
describing the club as a big family bound together by more than just football he said : " union is a social event .
we ’ ve got the spirit of a neighborhood club where everyone sticks together . "
the stadium construction project was proof , he said , that it is possible to combine " commercial soccer with preserving the club 's century-old tradition . "
iron men defy odds and oppression fc union berlin was founded in 1906 by metalworkers in the industrial district of koepenick in the east of the city .
union supporters ‘ rapturous chant " eisern union " - meaning " iron union " - first echoed through the old forestry stadium in the 1920s .
after world war two , berlin was divided and union berlin played in the leagues of the then communist east germany .
union berlin enjoyed cult status as the club of non-conformists and of all east berliners opposing the regime .
their eternal rivals in the city were bfc dynamo , a club run by the dreaded stasi secret police .
" they had a lot of money and they had the best players , " recalls thommy thiele , an union fan since he was 13 years old .
" we hated the bfc dynamo , we hated the secret service , we hated the berlin wall , we were in opposition to the state , " he told dw radio .
" that ’ s why in the 1980s there were over 20,000 people in the fc union stadium every match and only 5,000 people at bfc dynamo . "
after german unification in 1990 , fc union berlin experienced difficult economic times in professional soccer .
the club frequently hovered on the brink of insolvency .
there were fan protests at berlin ’ s brandenburg gate to force the city government to transform the stadium into club property .
in 2004 , union supporters donated blood to earn enough funds for the club to get dfb approval to play the next season .
new stadium ushers in new era those trying days have forged the club together , the fans say .
" the manager , the president , the coach , the team and the supporters make up a whole system , " says thommy thiele .
" dirk zingler , our president , was standing in the stadium behind me 20 years ago .
he is one of us , a part of the family . "
while the hard-working fans sweat it out on the stadium terraces , they can watch the players give their all on the training ground right next door .
to see the new oval rise from the rubble of the old stadium has been a huge boost for the team ’ s morale , said club coach uwe neuhaus .
" the team is well aware of the close bonds within the club .
this is something special and is currently being underscored by the fans very impressively . "
on saturday , coach neuhaus and the team paid back their debt to the fans by clinching promotion to the second division .
ironically , the victory came in the stadium of the hated bfc dynamo , where the team has played throughout the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union player macchambes younga-mouhani -lrb- 2.v.r -rrb- scores opening goal against jahn regensburg promotion to the second bundesliga ushers in new challenges for union berlin , said thommy thiele .
but even if the club will have to struggle commercially , as well as on the pitch , the iron-willed union community can never be broken up .
" we have to maintain our spirit .
we have a lot of common people in our community and there is not a lot of money .
in the third division , the second division , the first division or the fourth division , i don ’ t care .
fc union is important , not the league we play in . "
the new old forestry stadium is to be officially be inaugurated on july 8 , 2008 with a friendly against berlin ’ s top club hertha bsc .

reports say more than 14 million euros were paid in a kickback scheme over several years . prosecutors in munich said they have reason to believe that the german truck maker had a system in place to " boost the sales of trucks and buses . "
that system allegedly included illegal payouts to man customers .
at times , bank accounts of relatives and friends were used to disguise the transactions , according to prosecutors .
between 2002 and 2005 , an estimated 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- in bribes are thought to have been paid out , the majority of it to customers outside of germany .
prosecutors did not specify exactly how many people were being investigated , but said the number is " well over 100 . "
that figure includes both man marketing staff and customers suspected of having taken illegal payoffs .
about 300 police personnel across germany are involved in the probe .
two people were arrested last week , although one was later released .
suspects could face charges for bribery and tax evasion .
corruption an issue in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is a leading german truck maker man , which has volkswagen as its dominant shareholder , said it was fully cooperating with the prosecutors .
prosecutors said the top management at man had not been implicated in the allegations , which arose after a tip-off from tax authorities .
the inquiry comes on the heels of a corruption scandal at engineering and telecommunications giant siemens in 2006 .
investigators found that siemens staff had set up slush funds to pay " commissions " to secure contracts .
the affair led to a major restructuring at siemens and the company later agreed to pay one billion euros in fines .
in 2007 , man responded to the siemens scandal by appointing two ombudsmen to accept tip-offs from whistle-blowers in the company and investigate possible breaches of corporate standards . th / pfd , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following an aborted action by germany 's elite anti-terrorism police unit , the gsg 9 , to free a kidnapped freighter in somalia , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble wants to broaden the mandate of the bundeswehr . by a constitutional change the german military would be made responsible for an area which has until now been the province of the police .
" under the constitution , the gsg 9 is responsible for these kind of eventualities , but really , it should be the military 's duty .
for them to do this duty , though , we have to lay the legal foundations , and that means changing the constitution , " schaeuble said in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble , pushing for constitutional change the minister said it was decided to send the gsg 9 to africa because the bundeswehr alone could n't come up with the necessary resources to carry out a hostage liberation at sea .
shortly before the planned operation could take place , consultations with the officer in command led to its cancellation .
before the gsg 9 could reach the scene , the kidnappers had brought the ship into port .
the situation became much more dangerous , as more pirates had gone aboard and the risk that police or hostages could be killed in an operation became too high .
the weekly magazine der spiegel tells the story somewhat differently .
the magazine says a gsg 9 dress rehearsal aboard the us helicopter ship " boxer " was a success , but at the last minute the us withdrew support for the operation .
der spiegel also blamed coordination difficulties between the operational commander and high command in berlin .
on top of that , they say there were conflicts between the gsg 9 and the bundeswehr .
the gsg 9 are better trained for hostage operations than the military 's special forces , but for the transport abroad they depended on the army .
schaeuble said the constitutional changes he has recommended are provided for under the coalition agreement between the christian democratic union and the social democratic party , but he criticized that the social democrats have so far blocked the changes . ch / ai , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tui managed to post a first-quarter profit germany 's biggest tourism group , tui , posted a first quarter profit despite weak travel activities , crediting the sale of a part of its stake in the hapag-lloyd shipping unit . the german travel giant said gains on the sale of a stake in hapag-lloyd pushed it to a 415 million euro -lrb- $ 565 million -rrb- first-quarter net profit .
but sales were 15 percent lower .
the gain for the january-march period compared with a net loss of 279 million euros in the first quarter of 2008 , tui said .
sales for the period , however , fell 15 percent to 3.1 billion euros from 3.6 billion euros in the first-quarter of last year , as fewer people vacationed during the recession .
tui brought in 990 million euros in the quarter from the sale of a stake of its hapag-lloyd marine division to a consortium of investors , including the city of hamburg .
for 2009 as a whole , the company predicted sales would keep falling .
but the overall result " is expected to be positive and improve considerably year-on-year , " in part owing to the container-shipping sale and decreased integration costs in its tourism division . jen / ncy , ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vatican says it did not know enough about the bishop 's past and both sides now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit to jerusalem 's yad vashem memorial to holocaust victims .
most jewish leaders now consider the episode to have been put to rest - but not all .
the dorot hemeshech association of holocaust survivors has called on drivers to blow their car horns during the pope 's speech at yad vashem .
" israelis will this way express their disapproval of the pope who encourages holocaust denial and anti-semitism , " the association said .
the german-born pontiff 's membership in the hitler youth , although it was forced , has also angered holocaust survivors .
in addition , a group of far-right activists has said they plan to press criminal charges against the pope over vatican treasures they claim were plundered from jewish people , while nitzan horowitz , a gay rights activist and a left-wing parliamentarian , will boycott all official ceremonies held for the pope .
" pope benedict xvi is responsible for the suffering of thousands of people in the world , " horowitz said .
" he conveys a message of extremism and insensitivity , " he added , referring to a papal warning that condom use could be aggravating africa 's aids crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pm netanyahu has not yet endorsed the idea of a palestinian state pope to meet israeli and palestinian leaders during his five-day visit , pope benedict will hold talks with israeli and palestinian leaders .
he is expected to repeat his offer for the catholic church to do all it can to help the stalled peace process .
the vatican supports a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which also has internationally backing .
pope benedict will be welcomed by israeli president shimon peres and the country 's new , right-leaning prime minister , benjamin netanyahu .
since being sworn in to power at the end of march , netanyahu has so far refused to publicly endorse the creation of a palestinian state .
he did , however , say on sunday that israel will try to ease restrictions on palestinians in the west bank .
" i think we need to make a big effort , within the given security constraints , to make things easier for the palestinians , " netanyahu reportedly told ministers during a cabinet meeting .
after welcoming the pope , prime minister netanyahu heads to egypt , on his first trip to the arab world since he took office .
egypt is looking for netanyahu to support and endorse palestinian independence .
meanwhile , the united nations security council is holding talks on monday , to also revive the stalled middle east peace process . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin , who chairs the 15-member security council this month , called the meeting to stress the " urgency of reaching comprehensive peace in the middle east .

" basically if you did n't have oceans you would n't have a climate ... that sort of link and understanding is n't being talked about in climate change discussions , " jacqueline alder , head of the marine unit of the united nations environment program told news agency afp . the conference , which opened monday and lasts until friday , has drawn environmental experts , officials and ministers from 120 nations .
one of the main aims is to create a forum to coordinate international conservation efforts to counter the impact of rising sea levels and dwindling fish stocks blamed on higher temperatures . scientists warn of dramatic consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is tight for the conference in manado , sulawesi richard spinrad of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- said scientists are no longer ruling out a rise in sea levels by a whole meter in this century .
the world 's oceans absorb 22 million tons of carbon dioxide daily and acidity levels have risen by a third over the last 100 years , he added . scientists also say rising temperatures and over-fishing could lead to the collapse of key species that feed millions and help preserve vital ecosystems . " we 've calculated that if carbon emissions are n't cut , then in the long-term we 'll see the creation of large death zones in the seas at a depth of 200 and 800 meters which will hardly have any oxygen , " hans joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate change research told german newspaper die zeit recently . schellnhuber , who is chancellor angela merkel 's advisor on climate change , warned of dramatic consequences for fishing and world food supplies . indonesia pushes for special status for oceans indonesia , an archipelago nation of 17,000 islands , is pushing for recognition of the role of oceans in absorbing carbon dioxide which is blamed for global warming .
the government in jakarta has said it wants special status for oceans written into the successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . " it is clear that our precious marine resources are under dire and increasing threat and that in many parts of the world climate change will accelerate their destruction , " indonesian maritime affairs and fisheries minister freddy numberi said .
" adaptation and mitigation measures are urgently needed to be taken up not only to save marine and coastal resources but also to save the coastal communities . " saving coastal communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 150 million people in indonesia 's rely on the sea for their livelihood an estimated 150 people in the region are dependant on the ocean for their livelihood .
but pollution , tourism and illegal fishing have caused huge damage to indonesia 's marine ecosystems . " for the people here , the ocean provides everything they need to live - much more than in industrialized nations .
they 're totally dependant on the ocean 's resources , " tim jennerjahn , a biochemist at the leibnitz center for marine tropical ecology in bremen told german public broadcaster zdf . jennerjahn , who heads a joint german-indonesian project for the protection of indonesia 's coastline , said the aim was to create a sustainable coastal management system .
" that 's why it 's important that we present the project at the world ocean conference , " he said . meanwhile , leaders from six countries - east timor , indonesia , malaysia , papua new guinea , the philippines and the solomon islands - will meet on the margins of the conference to launch a plan to save the coral triangle , a vast underwater ecosystem that is home to more than half the world 's coral reefs . sp / sms , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has used a speech to seek to heal the wounds created by , among other things , his reinstatement of a holocaust-denying bishop . the pope has begun his landmark , five-day trip to israel and the palestinian territories by condemning the holocaust and lingering anti-semitism , and calling for a " just and lasting solution " to the middle east conflict .
" tragically , the jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person , " he said at tel aviv 's ben-gurion airport .
he then went on to challenge israel 's conservative government by calling for the creation of a palestinian state .
" i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the six million jewish victims of the shoah , " the german-born pope said , using the hebrew term for the holocaust , " and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude . "
benedict , only the third reigning pope to visit the region , said : " i come , like so many others before me , to pray at the holy places , to pray especially for peace - peace in the holy land and peace throughout the world . "
pope deplores anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres , right , called the pope 's visit a " mission of peace " benedict recently angered many jews by lifting the excommunication on a holocaust-denying bishop .
he caused further anger by backing the beatification of controversial nazi-era pope pius xii .
" sadly , anti-semitism continues to raise its ugly head in parts of the world , " said the pontiff , calling this " totally unacceptable " and declaring " every effort " must be made to combat anti-semitism .
in the 45 years since the second vatican council repudiated the concept of collective jewish guilt for christ 's death , catholic-jewish relations have been haunted by the holocaust and the question of what the church did , or failed to do , about it .
they went through one of their worst periods after the pope in january lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops , including one who denied that six million jews were killed .
the vatican says it had not known enough about that british bishop 's past and the church and jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to yad vashem in jerusalem , israel 's memorial to the victims of the holocaust .
calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu , left , did not directly respond to the pope 's call for a palestinian state israeli president shimon peres , the country 's official head of state whose duties are largely ceremonial , welcomed pope benedict , calling his visit to the holy land a " mission of peace " and of " planting the seeds of tolerance and uprooting the weeds of fanaticism . "
the politically moderate peres also expressed hope for a lasting peace in the middle east .
" we 've made peace with egypt and jordan and we are negotiating peace with the palestinians .
we may also arrive at a comprehensive regional peace here in the near future .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a hardliner , who since taking office in late march following february 10 elections has refrained from openly committing to the establishment of a palestinian state , did not make a speech at the airport .
" it 's a pleasure to welcome you to the holy land , " he said as he shook benedict 's hand once the pontiff alighted from the royal jordanian aircraft , which had flown him from amman , jordan , where he had arrived on friday .
a " religious pilgrimage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope toured a mosque during a visit to jordan the catholic church has made a point of emphasizing that this is not a state visit by the head of the vatican , but a non-political , religious pilgrimage by its spiritual leader .
yet the visit is being seen as another milestone in israel-vatican relations , which have been historically tumultuous and were only formalized in 1993 .
the first reigning pope to visit was paul xi in 1964 , who made a one-day stopover from jordan , but refrained from mentioning israel by name , or meeting israeli leaders in jerusalem .
the second was john paul ii , who made a highly successful and emotional visit in 2000 .
after his stop at the airport , the pontiff later flew by israeli military helicopter to jerusalem .
the pope planned to visit the memorial of jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust remembrance institute .
but he had no plans to visit the museum , which accuses pope pius xii of being silent in the face of the suffering of the jews . nt / pfd , reuters / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

much uncertainty remains , including who will own the auto giant and what city the company will call home . managers , lawyers and consultants from volkswagen and porsche began meetings on monday to discuss ways to bring the two german carmakers together into an integrated auto group , german press agency dpa reported , adding that it was still too early for talk among top executives . the two automakers have said they hope to be in a position to present a final merger plan by early-june , dpa reported .
many analysts have recently said negotiations will have to address a number of touchy subjects before a deal can be announced . " it 's not really clear how they will construct -lsb- the new company -rsb- , " juergen pieper from metzler bank told the afp news agency . contentious questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of both carmakers are wondering if factories will be shut or moved when company executives outlined merger plans on may 6 , they knew questions about where the resulting auto group would be based , who owns how much of the carmakers and who runs the company 's operations would be among the most contentious issues up for negotiation . " it is not a marriage made in heaven , but a marriage of convenience , " porsche boss wendelin wiedeking told the luxury sports carmaker 's workers may 7 . german media have reported that the new auto group is considering setting up its headquarters in either wolfsburg , where vw is currently based , or hannover , the capital of the state of lower saxony , which is a major volkswagen shareholder . porsche officials , however , said on monday that the location of the future carmaker 's headquarters remained uncertain .
porsche is based in the southern german city of stuttgart . even more important than where the offices are located is who will land in the vw-porsche driver 's seat .
in addition to vw chairman martin winterkorn and porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking , weekly news magazine focus reported the possibility that a " neutral " manager could take over . fresh start after long-running feud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche and volkswagen have been clashing for years audi boss rupert stadler is also being eyed for the top vw-porsche position , the magazine said , adding that he could represent a fresh start for porsche and volkswagen as a confidant of the porsche and piech families - who own porsche - and is also supported by lower saxony premier christian wulff , who control 's the state 's 20 percent stake in vw , and volkswagen 's ferdinand piech . the two carmakers have a long history of competition and strife due to personal and professional relationships among their founders , heads and supervisory board members .
porsche racked up some nine billion euros in debt trying to takeover vw , europe 's largest automaker and a company about 15 times larger than the luxury car firm . porsche spokesman albrecht bamler said company officials had not yet discussed who would head the company . the porsche and piech families would own between 45 percent and 55 percent of the merged company 's shares while lower saxony would have 21 percent to 25 percent , germany 's der spiegel magazine reported . plans to merge porsche and volkswagen into a single auto group would have to be approved by supervisory boards and shareholders at both companies .
if all involved agree to the deal , the resulting supervisory board would be responsible for naming the group 's boss . sms / pfd , ap / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following an aborted action by germany 's elite anti-terrorism police unit , the gsg 9 , to free a kidnapped freighter in somalia , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble wants to broaden the mandate of the bundeswehr . by a constitutional change the german military would be made responsible for an area which has until now been the province of the police .
" under the constitution , the gsg 9 is responsible for these kind of eventualities , but really , it should be the military 's duty .
for them to do this duty , though , we have to lay the legal foundations , and that means changing the constitution , " schaeuble said in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble , pushing for constitutional change the minister said it was decided to send the gsg 9 to africa because the bundeswehr alone could n't come up with the necessary resources to carry out a hostage liberation at sea .
shortly before the planned operation could take place , consultations with the officer in command led to its cancellation .
before the gsg 9 could reach the scene , the kidnappers had brought the ship into port .
the situation became much more dangerous , as more pirates had gone aboard and the risk that police or hostages could be killed in an operation became too high .
the weekly magazine der spiegel tells the story somewhat differently .
the magazine says a gsg 9 dress rehearsal aboard the us helicopter ship " boxer " was a success , but at the last minute the us withdrew support for the operation .
der spiegel also blamed coordination difficulties between the operational commander and high command in berlin .
on top of that , they say there were conflicts between the gsg 9 and the bundeswehr .
the gsg 9 are better trained for hostage operations than the military 's special forces , but for the transport abroad they depended on the army .
schaeuble said the constitutional changes he has recommended are provided for under the coalition agreement between the christian democratic union and the social democratic party , but he criticized that the social democrats have so far blocked the changes . ch / ai , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following an aborted action by germany 's elite anti-terrorism police unit , the gsg 9 , to free a kidnapped freighter in somalia , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble wants to broaden the mandate of the bundeswehr . by a constitutional change the german military would be made responsible for an area which has until now been the province of the police .
" under the constitution , the gsg 9 is responsible for these kind of eventualities , but really , it should be the military 's duty .
for them to do this duty , though , we have to lay the legal foundations , and that means changing the constitution , " schaeuble said in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble , pushing for constitutional change the minister said it was decided to send the gsg 9 to africa because the bundeswehr alone could n't come up with the necessary resources to carry out a hostage liberation at sea .
shortly before the planned operation could take place , consultations with the officer in command led to its cancellation .
before the gsg 9 could reach the scene , the kidnappers had brought the ship into port .
the situation became much more dangerous , as more pirates had gone aboard and the risk that police or hostages could be killed in an operation became too high .
the weekly magazine der spiegel tells the story somewhat differently .
the magazine says a gsg 9 dress rehearsal aboard the us helicopter ship " boxer " was a success , but at the last minute the us withdrew support for the operation .
der spiegel also blamed coordination difficulties between the operational commander and high command in berlin .
on top of that , they say there were conflicts between the gsg 9 and the bundeswehr .
the gsg 9 are better trained for hostage operations than the military 's special forces , but for the transport abroad they depended on the army .
schaeuble said the constitutional changes he has recommended are provided for under the coalition agreement between the christian democratic union and the social democratic party , but he criticized that the social democrats have so far blocked the changes . ch / ai , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is very little room for tax cuts and no one can say right now when the time will be right , " schaeuble said .
" new tax revenue estimates due later in may will show just how limited the scope for tax relief is . "
berlin is expected to slash its tax revenue estimates for 2009 by 48 billion euros -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- later this week .
however , chancellor merkel is sticking to her pledge .
in an interview on german public television , she said that tax relief could help the stimulate sluggish german economy .
" we need to mobilize all our forces to foster growth , " she said .
merkel is promising a three-pronged approach of tax relief , deficit cuts and investment in education and innovation .
schaeuble 's doubts echoed the difference in opinion does n't end with schaeuble .
several cdu state premiers had already criticized her plans to make tax relief a key plank of the party 's election campaign program .
the cdu premier of thuringia , dieter althaus , also said this weekend that his party had an obligation to be a guarantor of solid state finances .
horst seehofer , the head of the cdu 's sister party in bavaria , the christian social union , also raised his doubts .
" one is not allowed to make promises that one ca n't keep to , " he said .
the divisions over the tax issue could hurt merkel in september 's election , despite her current lead of 10 points over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , her partners in government .
merkel had been hoping she would coast to re-election this year on her economic record and the promise of tax cuts .

" basically if you did n't have oceans you would n't have a climate ... that sort of link and understanding is n't being talked about in climate change discussions , " jacqueline alder , head of the marine unit of the united nations environment program told news agency afp . the conference , which opened monday and lasts until friday , has drawn environmental experts , officials and ministers from 120 nations .
one of the main aims is to create a forum to coordinate international conservation efforts to counter the impact of rising sea levels and dwindling fish stocks blamed on higher temperatures . scientists warn of dramatic consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is tight for the conference in manado , sulawesi richard spinrad of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- said scientists are no longer ruling out a rise in sea levels by a whole meter in this century .
the world 's oceans absorb 22 million tons of carbon dioxide daily and acidity levels have risen by a third over the last 100 years , he added . scientists also say rising temperatures and over-fishing could lead to the collapse of key species that feed millions and help preserve vital ecosystems . " we 've calculated that if carbon emissions are n't cut , then in the long-term we 'll see the creation of large death zones in the seas at a depth of 200 and 800 meters which will hardly have any oxygen , " hans joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate change research told german newspaper die zeit recently . schellnhuber , who is chancellor angela merkel 's advisor on climate change , warned of dramatic consequences for fishing and world food supplies . indonesia pushes for special status for oceans indonesia , an archipelago nation of 17,000 islands , is pushing for recognition of the role of oceans in absorbing carbon dioxide which is blamed for global warming .
the government in jakarta has said it wants special status for oceans written into the successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . " it is clear that our precious marine resources are under dire and increasing threat and that in many parts of the world climate change will accelerate their destruction , " indonesian maritime affairs and fisheries minister freddy numberi said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 11.05.2009 pope seeks to salve holocaust wounds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict called on israeli leaders to find a solution to the middle east conflict pope benedict xvi is on his first trip to israel .
he has used a speech to seek to heal the wounds created by , among other things , his reinstatement of a holocaust-denying bishop . the pope has begun his landmark , five-day trip to israel and the palestinian territories by condemning the holocaust and lingering anti-semitism , and calling for a " just and lasting solution " to the middle east conflict .
" tragically , the jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person , " he said at tel aviv 's ben-gurion airport .
he then went on to challenge israel 's conservative government by calling for the creation of a palestinian state .
" i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the six million jewish victims of the shoah , " the german-born pope said , using the hebrew term for the holocaust , " and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude . "
benedict , only the third reigning pope to visit the region , said : " i come , like so many others before me , to pray at the holy places , to pray especially for peace - peace in the holy land and peace throughout the world . "
pope deplores anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres , right , called the pope 's visit a " mission of peace " benedict recently angered many jews by lifting the excommunication on a holocaust-denying bishop .
he caused further anger by backing the beatification of controversial nazi-era pope pius xii .
" sadly , anti-semitism continues to raise its ugly head in parts of the world , " said the pontiff , calling this " totally unacceptable " and declaring " every effort " must be made to combat anti-semitism .
in the 45 years since the second vatican council repudiated the concept of collective jewish guilt for christ 's death , catholic-jewish relations have been haunted by the holocaust and the question of what the church did , or failed to do , about it .
they went through one of their worst periods after the pope in january lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops , including one who denied that six million jews were killed .
the vatican says it had not known enough about that british bishop 's past and the church and jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to yad vashem in jerusalem , israel 's memorial to the victims of the holocaust .
calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu , left , did not directly respond to the pope 's call for a palestinian state israeli president shimon peres , the country 's official head of state whose duties are largely ceremonial , welcomed pope benedict , calling his visit to the holy land a " mission of peace " and of " planting the seeds of tolerance and uprooting the weeds of fanaticism . "
the politically moderate peres also expressed hope for a lasting peace in the middle east .
" we 've made peace with egypt and jordan and we are negotiating peace with the palestinians .
we may also arrive at a comprehensive regional peace here in the near future .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a hardliner , who since taking office in late march following february 10 elections has refrained from openly committing to the establishment of a palestinian state , did not make a speech at the airport .
" it 's a pleasure to welcome you to the holy land , " he said as he shook benedict 's hand once the pontiff alighted from the royal jordanian aircraft , which had flown him from amman , jordan , where he had arrived on friday .
a " religious pilgrimage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope toured a mosque during a visit to jordan the catholic church has made a point of emphasizing that this is not a state visit by the head of the vatican , but a non-political , religious pilgrimage by its spiritual leader .
yet the visit is being seen as another milestone in israel-vatican relations , which have been historically tumultuous and were only formalized in 1993 .
the first reigning pope to visit was paul xi in 1964 , who made a one-day stopover from jordan , but refrained from mentioning israel by name , or meeting israeli leaders in jerusalem .
the second was john paul ii , who made a highly successful and emotional visit in 2000 .
after his stop at the airport , the pontiff later flew by israeli military helicopter to jerusalem .
the pope planned to visit the memorial of jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust remembrance institute .
but he had no plans to visit the museum , which accuses pope pius xii of being silent in the face of the suffering of the jews . nt / pfd , reuters / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has used a speech to seek to heal the wounds created by , among other things , his reinstatement of a holocaust-denying bishop . the pope has begun his landmark , five-day trip to israel and the palestinian territories by condemning the holocaust and lingering anti-semitism , and calling for a " just and lasting solution " to the middle east conflict .
" tragically , the jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person , " he said at tel aviv 's ben-gurion airport .
he then went on to challenge israel 's conservative government by calling for the creation of a palestinian state .
" i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the six million jewish victims of the shoah , " the german-born pope said , using the hebrew term for the holocaust , " and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude . "
benedict , only the third reigning pope to visit the region , said : " i come , like so many others before me , to pray at the holy places , to pray especially for peace - peace in the holy land and peace throughout the world . "
pope deplores anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres , right , called the pope 's visit a " mission of peace " benedict recently angered many jews by lifting the excommunication on a holocaust-denying bishop .
he caused further anger by backing the beatification of controversial nazi-era pope pius xii .
" sadly , anti-semitism continues to raise its ugly head in parts of the world , " said the pontiff , calling this " totally unacceptable " and declaring " every effort " must be made to combat anti-semitism .
in the 45 years since the second vatican council repudiated the concept of collective jewish guilt for christ 's death , catholic-jewish relations have been haunted by the holocaust and the question of what the church did , or failed to do , about it .
they went through one of their worst periods after the pope in january lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops , including one who denied that six million jews were killed .
the vatican says it had not known enough about that british bishop 's past and the church and jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to yad vashem in jerusalem , israel 's memorial to the victims of the holocaust .
calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu , left , did not directly respond to the pope 's call for a palestinian state israeli president shimon peres , the country 's official head of state whose duties are largely ceremonial , welcomed pope benedict , calling his visit to the holy land a " mission of peace " and of " planting the seeds of tolerance and uprooting the weeds of fanaticism . "
the politically moderate peres also expressed hope for a lasting peace in the middle east .
" we 've made peace with egypt and jordan and we are negotiating peace with the palestinians .
we may also arrive at a comprehensive regional peace here in the near future .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a hardliner , who since taking office in late march following february 10 elections has refrained from openly committing to the establishment of a palestinian state , did not make a speech at the airport .
" it 's a pleasure to welcome you to the holy land , " he said as he shook benedict 's hand once the pontiff alighted from the royal jordanian aircraft , which had flown him from amman , jordan , where he had arrived on friday .
a " religious pilgrimage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope toured a mosque during a visit to jordan the catholic church has made a point of emphasizing that this is not a state visit by the head of the vatican , but a non-political , religious pilgrimage by its spiritual leader .
yet the visit is being seen as another milestone in israel-vatican relations , which have been historically tumultuous and were only formalized in 1993 .
the first reigning pope to visit was paul xi in 1964 , who made a one-day stopover from jordan , but refrained from mentioning israel by name , or meeting israeli leaders in jerusalem .
the second was john paul ii , who made a highly successful and emotional visit in 2000 .
after his stop at the airport , the pontiff later flew by israeli military helicopter to jerusalem .

he has used a speech to seek to heal the wounds created by , among other things , his reinstatement of a holocaust-denying bishop . the pope has begun his landmark , five-day trip to israel and the palestinian territories by condemning the holocaust and lingering anti-semitism , and calling for a " just and lasting solution " to the middle east conflict .
" tragically , the jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person , " he said at tel aviv 's ben-gurion airport .
he then went on to challenge israel 's conservative government by calling for the creation of a palestinian state .
" i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the six million jewish victims of the shoah , " the german-born pope said , using the hebrew term for the holocaust , " and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude . "
benedict , only the third reigning pope to visit the region , said : " i come , like so many others before me , to pray at the holy places , to pray especially for peace - peace in the holy land and peace throughout the world . "
pope deplores anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres , right , called the pope 's visit a " mission of peace " benedict recently angered many jews by lifting the excommunication on a holocaust-denying bishop .
he caused further anger by backing the beatification of controversial nazi-era pope pius xii .
" sadly , anti-semitism continues to raise its ugly head in parts of the world , " said the pontiff , calling this " totally unacceptable " and declaring " every effort " must be made to combat anti-semitism .
in the 45 years since the second vatican council repudiated the concept of collective jewish guilt for christ 's death , catholic-jewish relations have been haunted by the holocaust and the question of what the church did , or failed to do , about it .
they went through one of their worst periods after the pope in january lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops , including one who denied that six million jews were killed .
the vatican says it had not known enough about that british bishop 's past and the church and jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to yad vashem in jerusalem , israel 's memorial to the victims of the holocaust .
calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu , left , did not directly respond to the pope 's call for a palestinian state israeli president shimon peres , the country 's official head of state whose duties are largely ceremonial , welcomed pope benedict , calling his visit to the holy land a " mission of peace " and of " planting the seeds of tolerance and uprooting the weeds of fanaticism . "
the politically moderate peres also expressed hope for a lasting peace in the middle east .
" we 've made peace with egypt and jordan and we are negotiating peace with the palestinians .
we may also arrive at a comprehensive regional peace here in the near future .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a hardliner , who since taking office in late march following february 10 elections has refrained from openly committing to the establishment of a palestinian state , did not make a speech at the airport .
" it 's a pleasure to welcome you to the holy land , " he said as he shook benedict 's hand once the pontiff alighted from the royal jordanian aircraft , which had flown him from amman , jordan , where he had arrived on friday .
a " religious pilgrimage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope toured a mosque during a visit to jordan the catholic church has made a point of emphasizing that this is not a state visit by the head of the vatican , but a non-political , religious pilgrimage by its spiritual leader .
yet the visit is being seen as another milestone in israel-vatican relations , which have been historically tumultuous and were only formalized in 1993 .
the first reigning pope to visit was paul xi in 1964 , who made a one-day stopover from jordan , but refrained from mentioning israel by name , or meeting israeli leaders in jerusalem .
the second was john paul ii , who made a highly successful and emotional visit in 2000 .
after his stop at the airport , the pontiff later flew by israeli military helicopter to jerusalem .
the pope planned to visit the memorial of jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust remembrance institute .
but he had no plans to visit the museum , which accuses pope pius xii of being silent in the face of the suffering of the jews . nt / pfd , reuters / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " iron men " - as they are popularly known - have gained notoriety over the past 11 months as their unique fans have been tranforming their old stadium into a modern soccer arena .
" this is the most unique experience of my career , " sylvia weisheit told dw radio .
weisheit , who has been a die-hard union berlin fan for the past three decades , is the manager of the stadium construction project .
" the fans spend their free time and holidays working at the constuction site .
they are totally committed to the community , and any company would be glad to have such workers . "
the middle-aged blonde is one of only about six to 10 professional builders at the site .
the rest of the 60 to 80 workers turning up each morning at 7 a.m. are union supporters .
iron men with an iron will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union fans toil for club glory since construction of the new stadium began last june , around 1,600 volunteers have put in an estimated 90,000 hours of work .
they have saved the club two million euros from the overall construction costs of 15 million euros .
the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- had threatend to close the club ’ s old forestry stadium , which dates back to the 1920s .
dfb offcials said it no longer met the security requirements of professional soccer in germany .
michael - or " kibi " as he likes to be known - said the dfb 's decision was a test of union supporters unique fan culture .
describing the club as a big family bound together by more than just football he said : " union is a social event .
we ’ ve got the spirit of a neighborhood club where everyone sticks together . "
the stadium construction project was proof , he said , that it is possible to combine " commercial soccer with preserving the club 's century-old tradition . "
iron men defy odds and oppression fc union berlin was founded in 1906 by metalworkers in the industrial district of koepenick in the east of the city .
union supporters ‘ rapturous chant " eisern union " - meaning " iron union " - first echoed through the old forestry stadium in the 1920s .
after world war two , berlin was divided and union berlin played in the leagues of the then communist east germany .
union berlin enjoyed cult status as the club of non-conformists and of all east berliners opposing the regime .
their eternal rivals in the city were bfc dynamo , a club run by the dreaded stasi secret police .
" they had a lot of money and they had the best players , " recalls thommy thiele , an union fan since he was 13 years old .
" we hated the bfc dynamo , we hated the secret service , we hated the berlin wall , we were in opposition to the state , " he told dw radio .
" that ’ s why in the 1980s there were over 20,000 people in the fc union stadium every match and only 5,000 people at bfc dynamo . "
after german unification in 1990 , fc union berlin experienced difficult economic times in professional soccer .
the club frequently hovered on the brink of insolvency .
there were fan protests at berlin ’ s brandenburg gate to force the city government to transform the stadium into club property .
in 2004 , union supporters donated blood to earn enough funds for the club to get dfb approval to play the next season .
new stadium ushers in new era those trying days have forged the club together , the fans say .
" the manager , the president , the coach , the team and the supporters make up a whole system , " says thommy thiele .
" dirk zingler , our president , was standing in the stadium behind me 20 years ago .
he is one of us , a part of the family . "
while the hard-working fans sweat it out on the stadium terraces , they can watch the players give their all on the training ground right next door .
to see the new oval rise from the rubble of the old stadium has been a huge boost for the team ’ s morale , said club coach uwe neuhaus .
" the team is well aware of the close bonds within the club .
this is something special and is currently being underscored by the fans very impressively . "
on saturday , coach neuhaus and the team paid back their debt to the fans by clinching promotion to the second division .
ironically , the victory came in the stadium of the hated bfc dynamo , where the team has played throughout the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union player macchambes younga-mouhani -lrb- 2.v.r -rrb- scores opening goal against jahn regensburg promotion to the second bundesliga ushers in new challenges for union berlin , said thommy thiele .
but even if the club will have to struggle commercially , as well as on the pitch , the iron-willed union community can never be broken up .
" we have to maintain our spirit .
we have a lot of common people in our community and there is not a lot of money .
in the third division , the second division , the first division or the fourth division , i don ’ t care .
fc union is important , not the league we play in . "
the new old forestry stadium is to be officially be inaugurated on july 8 , 2008 with a friendly against berlin ’ s top club hertha bsc .

reports say more than 14 million euros were paid in a kickback scheme over several years . prosecutors in munich said they have reason to believe that the german truck maker had a system in place to " boost the sales of trucks and buses . "
that system allegedly included illegal payouts to man customers .
at times , bank accounts of relatives and friends were used to disguise the transactions , according to prosecutors .
between 2002 and 2005 , an estimated 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- in bribes are thought to have been paid out , the majority of it to customers outside of germany .
prosecutors did not specify exactly how many people were being investigated , but said the number is " well over 100 . "
that figure includes both man marketing staff and customers suspected of having taken illegal payoffs .
about 300 police personnel across germany are involved in the probe .
two people were arrested last week , although one was later released .
suspects could face charges for bribery and tax evasion .
corruption an issue in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is a leading german truck maker man , which has volkswagen as its dominant shareholder , said it was fully cooperating with the prosecutors .
prosecutors said the top management at man had not been implicated in the allegations , which arose after a tip-off from tax authorities .
the inquiry comes on the heels of a corruption scandal at engineering and telecommunications giant siemens in 2006 .
investigators found that siemens staff had set up slush funds to pay " commissions " to secure contracts .
the affair led to a major restructuring at siemens and the company later agreed to pay one billion euros in fines .
in 2007 , man responded to the siemens scandal by appointing two ombudsmen to accept tip-offs from whistle-blowers in the company and investigate possible breaches of corporate standards . th / pfd , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following an aborted action by germany 's elite anti-terrorism police unit , the gsg 9 , to free a kidnapped freighter in somalia , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble wants to broaden the mandate of the bundeswehr . by a constitutional change the german military would be made responsible for an area which has until now been the province of the police .
" under the constitution , the gsg 9 is responsible for these kind of eventualities , but really , it should be the military 's duty .
for them to do this duty , though , we have to lay the legal foundations , and that means changing the constitution , " schaeuble said in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble , pushing for constitutional change the minister said it was decided to send the gsg 9 to africa because the bundeswehr alone could n't come up with the necessary resources to carry out a hostage liberation at sea .
shortly before the planned operation could take place , consultations with the officer in command led to its cancellation .
before the gsg 9 could reach the scene , the kidnappers had brought the ship into port .
the situation became much more dangerous , as more pirates had gone aboard and the risk that police or hostages could be killed in an operation became too high .
the weekly magazine der spiegel tells the story somewhat differently .
the magazine says a gsg 9 dress rehearsal aboard the us helicopter ship " boxer " was a success , but at the last minute the us withdrew support for the operation .
der spiegel also blamed coordination difficulties between the operational commander and high command in berlin .
on top of that , they say there were conflicts between the gsg 9 and the bundeswehr .
the gsg 9 are better trained for hostage operations than the military 's special forces , but for the transport abroad they depended on the army .
schaeuble said the constitutional changes he has recommended are provided for under the coalition agreement between the christian democratic union and the social democratic party , but he criticized that the social democrats have so far blocked the changes . ch / ai , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following an aborted action by germany 's elite anti-terrorism police unit , the gsg 9 , to free a kidnapped freighter in somalia , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble wants to broaden the mandate of the bundeswehr . by a constitutional change the german military would be made responsible for an area which has until now been the province of the police .
" under the constitution , the gsg 9 is responsible for these kind of eventualities , but really , it should be the military 's duty .
for them to do this duty , though , we have to lay the legal foundations , and that means changing the constitution , " schaeuble said in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble , pushing for constitutional change the minister said it was decided to send the gsg 9 to africa because the bundeswehr alone could n't come up with the necessary resources to carry out a hostage liberation at sea .
shortly before the planned operation could take place , consultations with the officer in command led to its cancellation .
before the gsg 9 could reach the scene , the kidnappers had brought the ship into port .
the situation became much more dangerous , as more pirates had gone aboard and the risk that police or hostages could be killed in an operation became too high .
the weekly magazine der spiegel tells the story somewhat differently .
the magazine says a gsg 9 dress rehearsal aboard the us helicopter ship " boxer " was a success , but at the last minute the us withdrew support for the operation .
der spiegel also blamed coordination difficulties between the operational commander and high command in berlin .
on top of that , they say there were conflicts between the gsg 9 and the bundeswehr .
the gsg 9 are better trained for hostage operations than the military 's special forces , but for the transport abroad they depended on the army .

much uncertainty remains , including who will own the auto giant and what city the company will call home . managers , lawyers and consultants from volkswagen and porsche began meetings on monday to discuss ways to bring the two german carmakers together into an integrated auto group , german press agency dpa reported , adding that it was still too early for talk among top executives . the two automakers have said they hope to be in a position to present a final merger plan by early-june , dpa reported .
many analysts have recently said negotiations will have to address a number of touchy subjects before a deal can be announced . " it 's not really clear how they will construct -lsb- the new company -rsb- , " juergen pieper from metzler bank told the afp news agency . contentious questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of both carmakers are wondering if factories will be shut or moved when company executives outlined merger plans on may 6 , they knew questions about where the resulting auto group would be based , who owns how much of the carmakers and who runs the company 's operations would be among the most contentious issues up for negotiation . " it is not a marriage made in heaven , but a marriage of convenience , " porsche boss wendelin wiedeking told the luxury sports carmaker 's workers may 7 . german media have reported that the new auto group is considering setting up its headquarters in either wolfsburg , where vw is currently based , or hannover , the capital of the state of lower saxony , which is a major volkswagen shareholder . porsche officials , however , said on monday that the location of the future carmaker 's headquarters remained uncertain .
porsche is based in the southern german city of stuttgart . even more important than where the offices are located is who will land in the vw-porsche driver 's seat .
in addition to vw chairman martin winterkorn and porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking , weekly news magazine focus reported the possibility that a " neutral " manager could take over . fresh start after long-running feud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche and volkswagen have been clashing for years audi boss rupert stadler is also being eyed for the top vw-porsche position , the magazine said , adding that he could represent a fresh start for porsche and volkswagen as a confidant of the porsche and piech families - who own porsche - and is also supported by lower saxony premier christian wulff , who control 's the state 's 20 percent stake in vw , and volkswagen 's ferdinand piech . the two carmakers have a long history of competition and strife due to personal and professional relationships among their founders , heads and supervisory board members .
porsche racked up some nine billion euros in debt trying to takeover vw , europe 's largest automaker and a company about 15 times larger than the luxury car firm . porsche spokesman albrecht bamler said company officials had not yet discussed who would head the company . the porsche and piech families would own between 45 percent and 55 percent of the merged company 's shares while lower saxony would have 21 percent to 25 percent , germany 's der spiegel magazine reported . plans to merge porsche and volkswagen into a single auto group would have to be approved by supervisory boards and shareholders at both companies .
if all involved agree to the deal , the resulting supervisory board would be responsible for naming the group 's boss . sms / pfd , ap / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is very little room for tax cuts and no one can say right now when the time will be right , " schaeuble said .
" new tax revenue estimates due later in may will show just how limited the scope for tax relief is . "
berlin is expected to slash its tax revenue estimates for 2009 by 48 billion euros -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- later this week .
however , chancellor merkel is sticking to her pledge .
in an interview on german public television , she said that tax relief could help the stimulate sluggish german economy .
" we need to mobilize all our forces to foster growth , " she said .
merkel is promising a three-pronged approach of tax relief , deficit cuts and investment in education and innovation .
schaeuble 's doubts echoed the difference in opinion does n't end with schaeuble .
several cdu state premiers had already criticized her plans to make tax relief a key plank of the party 's election campaign program .
the cdu premier of thuringia , dieter althaus , also said this weekend that his party had an obligation to be a guarantor of solid state finances .
horst seehofer , the head of the cdu 's sister party in bavaria , the christian social union , also raised his doubts .
" one is not allowed to make promises that one ca n't keep to , " he said .
the divisions over the tax issue could hurt merkel in september 's election , despite her current lead of 10 points over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , her partners in government .
merkel had been hoping she would coast to re-election this year on her economic record and the promise of tax cuts .
things look rather different now , however , as the global financial crisis has plunged germany into its deepest recession since world war ii and the economic and fiscal gains from her first three years in office now just a distant memory . cg / jk , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vatican says it did not know enough about the bishop 's past and both sides now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit to jerusalem 's yad vashem memorial to holocaust victims .
most jewish leaders now consider the episode to have been put to rest - but not all .
the dorot hemeshech association of holocaust survivors has called on drivers to blow their car horns during the pope 's speech at yad vashem .
" israelis will this way express their disapproval of the pope who encourages holocaust denial and anti-semitism , " the association said .
the german-born pontiff 's membership in the hitler youth , although it was forced , has also angered holocaust survivors .
in addition , a group of far-right activists has said they plan to press criminal charges against the pope over vatican treasures they claim were plundered from jewish people , while nitzan horowitz , a gay rights activist and a left-wing parliamentarian , will boycott all official ceremonies held for the pope .
" pope benedict xvi is responsible for the suffering of thousands of people in the world , " horowitz said .
" he conveys a message of extremism and insensitivity , " he added , referring to a papal warning that condom use could be aggravating africa 's aids crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pm netanyahu has not yet endorsed the idea of a palestinian state pope to meet israeli and palestinian leaders during his five-day visit , pope benedict will hold talks with israeli and palestinian leaders .
he is expected to repeat his offer for the catholic church to do all it can to help the stalled peace process .
the vatican supports a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which also has internationally backing .
pope benedict will be welcomed by israeli president shimon peres and the country 's new , right-leaning prime minister , benjamin netanyahu .
since being sworn in to power at the end of march , netanyahu has so far refused to publicly endorse the creation of a palestinian state .
he did , however , say on sunday that israel will try to ease restrictions on palestinians in the west bank .
" i think we need to make a big effort , within the given security constraints , to make things easier for the palestinians , " netanyahu reportedly told ministers during a cabinet meeting .
after welcoming the pope , prime minister netanyahu heads to egypt , on his first trip to the arab world since he took office .
egypt is looking for netanyahu to support and endorse palestinian independence .
meanwhile , the united nations security council is holding talks on monday , to also revive the stalled middle east peace process . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin , who chairs the 15-member security council this month , called the meeting to stress the " urgency of reaching comprehensive peace in the middle east .

much uncertainty remains , including who will own the auto giant and what city the company will call home . managers , lawyers and consultants from volkswagen and porsche began meetings on monday to discuss ways to bring the two german carmakers together into an integrated auto group , german press agency dpa reported , adding that it was still too early for talk among top executives . the two automakers have said they hope to be in a position to present a final merger plan by early-june , dpa reported .
many analysts have recently said negotiations will have to address a number of touchy subjects before a deal can be announced . " it 's not really clear how they will construct -lsb- the new company -rsb- , " juergen pieper from metzler bank told the afp news agency . contentious questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of both carmakers are wondering if factories will be shut or moved when company executives outlined merger plans on may 6 , they knew questions about where the resulting auto group would be based , who owns how much of the carmakers and who runs the company 's operations would be among the most contentious issues up for negotiation . " it is not a marriage made in heaven , but a marriage of convenience , " porsche boss wendelin wiedeking told the luxury sports carmaker 's workers may 7 . german media have reported that the new auto group is considering setting up its headquarters in either wolfsburg , where vw is currently based , or hannover , the capital of the state of lower saxony , which is a major volkswagen shareholder . porsche officials , however , said on monday that the location of the future carmaker 's headquarters remained uncertain .
porsche is based in the southern german city of stuttgart . even more important than where the offices are located is who will land in the vw-porsche driver 's seat .
in addition to vw chairman martin winterkorn and porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking , weekly news magazine focus reported the possibility that a " neutral " manager could take over . fresh start after long-running feud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche and volkswagen have been clashing for years audi boss rupert stadler is also being eyed for the top vw-porsche position , the magazine said , adding that he could represent a fresh start for porsche and volkswagen as a confidant of the porsche and piech families - who own porsche - and is also supported by lower saxony premier christian wulff , who control 's the state 's 20 percent stake in vw , and volkswagen 's ferdinand piech . the two carmakers have a long history of competition and strife due to personal and professional relationships among their founders , heads and supervisory board members .
porsche racked up some nine billion euros in debt trying to takeover vw , europe 's largest automaker and a company about 15 times larger than the luxury car firm . porsche spokesman albrecht bamler said company officials had not yet discussed who would head the company . the porsche and piech families would own between 45 percent and 55 percent of the merged company 's shares while lower saxony would have 21 percent to 25 percent , germany 's der spiegel magazine reported . plans to merge porsche and volkswagen into a single auto group would have to be approved by supervisory boards and shareholders at both companies .
if all involved agree to the deal , the resulting supervisory board would be responsible for naming the group 's boss . sms / pfd , ap / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 11.05.2009 speculation abounds over future boss of a vw-porsche group großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche and vw officials have given themselves until early june to draft a merger plan german car experts are waiting to see who takes the wheel after a potential tie-up of porsche and vw .
much uncertainty remains , including who will own the auto giant and what city the company will call home . managers , lawyers and consultants from volkswagen and porsche began meetings on monday to discuss ways to bring the two german carmakers together into an integrated auto group , german press agency dpa reported , adding that it was still too early for talk among top executives . the two automakers have said they hope to be in a position to present a final merger plan by early-june , dpa reported .
many analysts have recently said negotiations will have to address a number of touchy subjects before a deal can be announced . " it 's not really clear how they will construct -lsb- the new company -rsb- , " juergen pieper from metzler bank told the afp news agency . contentious questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of both carmakers are wondering if factories will be shut or moved when company executives outlined merger plans on may 6 , they knew questions about where the resulting auto group would be based , who owns how much of the carmakers and who runs the company 's operations would be among the most contentious issues up for negotiation . " it is not a marriage made in heaven , but a marriage of convenience , " porsche boss wendelin wiedeking told the luxury sports carmaker 's workers may 7 . german media have reported that the new auto group is considering setting up its headquarters in either wolfsburg , where vw is currently based , or hannover , the capital of the state of lower saxony , which is a major volkswagen shareholder . porsche officials , however , said on monday that the location of the future carmaker 's headquarters remained uncertain .
porsche is based in the southern german city of stuttgart . even more important than where the offices are located is who will land in the vw-porsche driver 's seat .
in addition to vw chairman martin winterkorn and porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking , weekly news magazine focus reported the possibility that a " neutral " manager could take over . fresh start after long-running feud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche and volkswagen have been clashing for years audi boss rupert stadler is also being eyed for the top vw-porsche position , the magazine said , adding that he could represent a fresh start for porsche and volkswagen as a confidant of the porsche and piech families - who own porsche - and is also supported by lower saxony premier christian wulff , who control 's the state 's 20 percent stake in vw , and volkswagen 's ferdinand piech . the two carmakers have a long history of competition and strife due to personal and professional relationships among their founders , heads and supervisory board members .
porsche racked up some nine billion euros in debt trying to takeover vw , europe 's largest automaker and a company about 15 times larger than the luxury car firm . porsche spokesman albrecht bamler said company officials had not yet discussed who would head the company . the porsche and piech families would own between 45 percent and 55 percent of the merged company 's shares while lower saxony would have 21 percent to 25 percent , germany 's der spiegel magazine reported . plans to merge porsche and volkswagen into a single auto group would have to be approved by supervisory boards and shareholders at both companies .
if all involved agree to the deal , the resulting supervisory board would be responsible for naming the group 's boss . sms / pfd , ap / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

much uncertainty remains , including who will own the auto giant and what city the company will call home . managers , lawyers and consultants from volkswagen and porsche began meetings on monday to discuss ways to bring the two german carmakers together into an integrated auto group , german press agency dpa reported , adding that it was still too early for talk among top executives . the two automakers have said they hope to be in a position to present a final merger plan by early-june , dpa reported .
many analysts have recently said negotiations will have to address a number of touchy subjects before a deal can be announced . " it 's not really clear how they will construct -lsb- the new company -rsb- , " juergen pieper from metzler bank told the afp news agency . contentious questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of both carmakers are wondering if factories will be shut or moved when company executives outlined merger plans on may 6 , they knew questions about where the resulting auto group would be based , who owns how much of the carmakers and who runs the company 's operations would be among the most contentious issues up for negotiation . " it is not a marriage made in heaven , but a marriage of convenience , " porsche boss wendelin wiedeking told the luxury sports carmaker 's workers may 7 . german media have reported that the new auto group is considering setting up its headquarters in either wolfsburg , where vw is currently based , or hannover , the capital of the state of lower saxony , which is a major volkswagen shareholder . porsche officials , however , said on monday that the location of the future carmaker 's headquarters remained uncertain .
porsche is based in the southern german city of stuttgart . even more important than where the offices are located is who will land in the vw-porsche driver 's seat .
in addition to vw chairman martin winterkorn and porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking , weekly news magazine focus reported the possibility that a " neutral " manager could take over . fresh start after long-running feud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche and volkswagen have been clashing for years audi boss rupert stadler is also being eyed for the top vw-porsche position , the magazine said , adding that he could represent a fresh start for porsche and volkswagen as a confidant of the porsche and piech families - who own porsche - and is also supported by lower saxony premier christian wulff , who control 's the state 's 20 percent stake in vw , and volkswagen 's ferdinand piech . the two carmakers have a long history of competition and strife due to personal and professional relationships among their founders , heads and supervisory board members .
porsche racked up some nine billion euros in debt trying to takeover vw , europe 's largest automaker and a company about 15 times larger than the luxury car firm . porsche spokesman albrecht bamler said company officials had not yet discussed who would head the company . the porsche and piech families would own between 45 percent and 55 percent of the merged company 's shares while lower saxony would have 21 percent to 25 percent , germany 's der spiegel magazine reported . plans to merge porsche and volkswagen into a single auto group would have to be approved by supervisory boards and shareholders at both companies .
if all involved agree to the deal , the resulting supervisory board would be responsible for naming the group 's boss . sms / pfd , ap / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" basically if you did n't have oceans you would n't have a climate ... that sort of link and understanding is n't being talked about in climate change discussions , " jacqueline alder , head of the marine unit of the united nations environment program told news agency afp . the conference , which opened monday and lasts until friday , has drawn environmental experts , officials and ministers from 120 nations .
one of the main aims is to create a forum to coordinate international conservation efforts to counter the impact of rising sea levels and dwindling fish stocks blamed on higher temperatures . scientists warn of dramatic consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is tight for the conference in manado , sulawesi richard spinrad of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- said scientists are no longer ruling out a rise in sea levels by a whole meter in this century .
the world 's oceans absorb 22 million tons of carbon dioxide daily and acidity levels have risen by a third over the last 100 years , he added . scientists also say rising temperatures and over-fishing could lead to the collapse of key species that feed millions and help preserve vital ecosystems . " we 've calculated that if carbon emissions are n't cut , then in the long-term we 'll see the creation of large death zones in the seas at a depth of 200 and 800 meters which will hardly have any oxygen , " hans joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate change research told german newspaper die zeit recently . schellnhuber , who is chancellor angela merkel 's advisor on climate change , warned of dramatic consequences for fishing and world food supplies . indonesia pushes for special status for oceans indonesia , an archipelago nation of 17,000 islands , is pushing for recognition of the role of oceans in absorbing carbon dioxide which is blamed for global warming .
the government in jakarta has said it wants special status for oceans written into the successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . " it is clear that our precious marine resources are under dire and increasing threat and that in many parts of the world climate change will accelerate their destruction , " indonesian maritime affairs and fisheries minister freddy numberi said .
" adaptation and mitigation measures are urgently needed to be taken up not only to save marine and coastal resources but also to save the coastal communities . " saving coastal communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 150 million people in indonesia 's rely on the sea for their livelihood an estimated 150 people in the region are dependant on the ocean for their livelihood .

they 're totally dependant on the ocean 's resources , " tim jennerjahn , a biochemist at the leibnitz center for marine tropical ecology in bremen told german public broadcaster zdf . jennerjahn , who heads a joint german-indonesian project for the protection of indonesia 's coastline , said the aim was to create a sustainable coastal management system .
" that 's why it 's important that we present the project at the world ocean conference , " he said . meanwhile , leaders from six countries - east timor , indonesia , malaysia , papua new guinea , the philippines and the solomon islands - will meet on the margins of the conference to launch a plan to save the coral triangle , a vast underwater ecosystem that is home to more than half the world 's coral reefs . sp / sms , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reports say more than 14 million euros were paid in a kickback scheme over several years . prosecutors in munich said they have reason to believe that the german truck maker had a system in place to " boost the sales of trucks and buses . "
that system allegedly included illegal payouts to man customers .
at times , bank accounts of relatives and friends were used to disguise the transactions , according to prosecutors .
between 2002 and 2005 , an estimated 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- in bribes are thought to have been paid out , the majority of it to customers outside of germany .
prosecutors did not specify exactly how many people were being investigated , but said the number is " well over 100 . "
that figure includes both man marketing staff and customers suspected of having taken illegal payoffs .
about 300 police personnel across germany are involved in the probe .
two people were arrested last week , although one was later released .
suspects could face charges for bribery and tax evasion .
corruption an issue in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is a leading german truck maker man , which has volkswagen as its dominant shareholder , said it was fully cooperating with the prosecutors .
prosecutors said the top management at man had not been implicated in the allegations , which arose after a tip-off from tax authorities .
the inquiry comes on the heels of a corruption scandal at engineering and telecommunications giant siemens in 2006 .
investigators found that siemens staff had set up slush funds to pay " commissions " to secure contracts .
the affair led to a major restructuring at siemens and the company later agreed to pay one billion euros in fines .
in 2007 , man responded to the siemens scandal by appointing two ombudsmen to accept tip-offs from whistle-blowers in the company and investigate possible breaches of corporate standards . th / pfd , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has used a speech to seek to heal the wounds created by , among other things , his reinstatement of a holocaust-denying bishop . the pope has begun his landmark , five-day trip to israel and the palestinian territories by condemning the holocaust and lingering anti-semitism , and calling for a " just and lasting solution " to the middle east conflict .
" tragically , the jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person , " he said at tel aviv 's ben-gurion airport .
he then went on to challenge israel 's conservative government by calling for the creation of a palestinian state .
" i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the six million jewish victims of the shoah , " the german-born pope said , using the hebrew term for the holocaust , " and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude . "
benedict , only the third reigning pope to visit the region , said : " i come , like so many others before me , to pray at the holy places , to pray especially for peace - peace in the holy land and peace throughout the world . "
pope deplores anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres , right , called the pope 's visit a " mission of peace " benedict recently angered many jews by lifting the excommunication on a holocaust-denying bishop .
he caused further anger by backing the beatification of controversial nazi-era pope pius xii .
" sadly , anti-semitism continues to raise its ugly head in parts of the world , " said the pontiff , calling this " totally unacceptable " and declaring " every effort " must be made to combat anti-semitism .
in the 45 years since the second vatican council repudiated the concept of collective jewish guilt for christ 's death , catholic-jewish relations have been haunted by the holocaust and the question of what the church did , or failed to do , about it .
they went through one of their worst periods after the pope in january lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops , including one who denied that six million jews were killed .
the vatican says it had not known enough about that british bishop 's past and the church and jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to yad vashem in jerusalem , israel 's memorial to the victims of the holocaust .
calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu , left , did not directly respond to the pope 's call for a palestinian state israeli president shimon peres , the country 's official head of state whose duties are largely ceremonial , welcomed pope benedict , calling his visit to the holy land a " mission of peace " and of " planting the seeds of tolerance and uprooting the weeds of fanaticism . "
the politically moderate peres also expressed hope for a lasting peace in the middle east .
" we 've made peace with egypt and jordan and we are negotiating peace with the palestinians .
we may also arrive at a comprehensive regional peace here in the near future .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a hardliner , who since taking office in late march following february 10 elections has refrained from openly committing to the establishment of a palestinian state , did not make a speech at the airport .
" it 's a pleasure to welcome you to the holy land , " he said as he shook benedict 's hand once the pontiff alighted from the royal jordanian aircraft , which had flown him from amman , jordan , where he had arrived on friday .
a " religious pilgrimage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope toured a mosque during a visit to jordan the catholic church has made a point of emphasizing that this is not a state visit by the head of the vatican , but a non-political , religious pilgrimage by its spiritual leader .
yet the visit is being seen as another milestone in israel-vatican relations , which have been historically tumultuous and were only formalized in 1993 .
the first reigning pope to visit was paul xi in 1964 , who made a one-day stopover from jordan , but refrained from mentioning israel by name , or meeting israeli leaders in jerusalem .
the second was john paul ii , who made a highly successful and emotional visit in 2000 .
after his stop at the airport , the pontiff later flew by israeli military helicopter to jerusalem .
the pope planned to visit the memorial of jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust remembrance institute .

he has used a speech to seek to heal the wounds created by , among other things , his reinstatement of a holocaust-denying bishop . the pope has begun his landmark , five-day trip to israel and the palestinian territories by condemning the holocaust and lingering anti-semitism , and calling for a " just and lasting solution " to the middle east conflict .
" tragically , the jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person , " he said at tel aviv 's ben-gurion airport .
he then went on to challenge israel 's conservative government by calling for the creation of a palestinian state .
" i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the six million jewish victims of the shoah , " the german-born pope said , using the hebrew term for the holocaust , " and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude . "
benedict , only the third reigning pope to visit the region , said : " i come , like so many others before me , to pray at the holy places , to pray especially for peace - peace in the holy land and peace throughout the world . "
pope deplores anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres , right , called the pope 's visit a " mission of peace " benedict recently angered many jews by lifting the excommunication on a holocaust-denying bishop .
he caused further anger by backing the beatification of controversial nazi-era pope pius xii .
" sadly , anti-semitism continues to raise its ugly head in parts of the world , " said the pontiff , calling this " totally unacceptable " and declaring " every effort " must be made to combat anti-semitism .
in the 45 years since the second vatican council repudiated the concept of collective jewish guilt for christ 's death , catholic-jewish relations have been haunted by the holocaust and the question of what the church did , or failed to do , about it .
they went through one of their worst periods after the pope in january lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops , including one who denied that six million jews were killed .
the vatican says it had not known enough about that british bishop 's past and the church and jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to yad vashem in jerusalem , israel 's memorial to the victims of the holocaust .
calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu , left , did not directly respond to the pope 's call for a palestinian state israeli president shimon peres , the country 's official head of state whose duties are largely ceremonial , welcomed pope benedict , calling his visit to the holy land a " mission of peace " and of " planting the seeds of tolerance and uprooting the weeds of fanaticism . "
the politically moderate peres also expressed hope for a lasting peace in the middle east .
" we 've made peace with egypt and jordan and we are negotiating peace with the palestinians .
we may also arrive at a comprehensive regional peace here in the near future .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a hardliner , who since taking office in late march following february 10 elections has refrained from openly committing to the establishment of a palestinian state , did not make a speech at the airport .
" it 's a pleasure to welcome you to the holy land , " he said as he shook benedict 's hand once the pontiff alighted from the royal jordanian aircraft , which had flown him from amman , jordan , where he had arrived on friday .
a " religious pilgrimage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope toured a mosque during a visit to jordan the catholic church has made a point of emphasizing that this is not a state visit by the head of the vatican , but a non-political , religious pilgrimage by its spiritual leader .
yet the visit is being seen as another milestone in israel-vatican relations , which have been historically tumultuous and were only formalized in 1993 .
the first reigning pope to visit was paul xi in 1964 , who made a one-day stopover from jordan , but refrained from mentioning israel by name , or meeting israeli leaders in jerusalem .
the second was john paul ii , who made a highly successful and emotional visit in 2000 .
after his stop at the airport , the pontiff later flew by israeli military helicopter to jerusalem .
the pope planned to visit the memorial of jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust remembrance institute .
but he had no plans to visit the museum , which accuses pope pius xii of being silent in the face of the suffering of the jews . nt / pfd , reuters / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

much uncertainty remains , including who will own the auto giant and what city the company will call home . managers , lawyers and consultants from volkswagen and porsche began meetings on monday to discuss ways to bring the two german carmakers together into an integrated auto group , german press agency dpa reported , adding that it was still too early for talk among top executives . the two automakers have said they hope to be in a position to present a final merger plan by early-june , dpa reported .
many analysts have recently said negotiations will have to address a number of touchy subjects before a deal can be announced . " it 's not really clear how they will construct -lsb- the new company -rsb- , " juergen pieper from metzler bank told the afp news agency . contentious questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of both carmakers are wondering if factories will be shut or moved when company executives outlined merger plans on may 6 , they knew questions about where the resulting auto group would be based , who owns how much of the carmakers and who runs the company 's operations would be among the most contentious issues up for negotiation . " it is not a marriage made in heaven , but a marriage of convenience , " porsche boss wendelin wiedeking told the luxury sports carmaker 's workers may 7 . german media have reported that the new auto group is considering setting up its headquarters in either wolfsburg , where vw is currently based , or hannover , the capital of the state of lower saxony , which is a major volkswagen shareholder . porsche officials , however , said on monday that the location of the future carmaker 's headquarters remained uncertain .
porsche is based in the southern german city of stuttgart . even more important than where the offices are located is who will land in the vw-porsche driver 's seat .
in addition to vw chairman martin winterkorn and porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking , weekly news magazine focus reported the possibility that a " neutral " manager could take over . fresh start after long-running feud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche and volkswagen have been clashing for years audi boss rupert stadler is also being eyed for the top vw-porsche position , the magazine said , adding that he could represent a fresh start for porsche and volkswagen as a confidant of the porsche and piech families - who own porsche - and is also supported by lower saxony premier christian wulff , who control 's the state 's 20 percent stake in vw , and volkswagen 's ferdinand piech . the two carmakers have a long history of competition and strife due to personal and professional relationships among their founders , heads and supervisory board members .
porsche racked up some nine billion euros in debt trying to takeover vw , europe 's largest automaker and a company about 15 times larger than the luxury car firm . porsche spokesman albrecht bamler said company officials had not yet discussed who would head the company . the porsche and piech families would own between 45 percent and 55 percent of the merged company 's shares while lower saxony would have 21 percent to 25 percent , germany 's der spiegel magazine reported . plans to merge porsche and volkswagen into a single auto group would have to be approved by supervisory boards and shareholders at both companies .
if all involved agree to the deal , the resulting supervisory board would be responsible for naming the group 's boss . sms / pfd , ap / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 11.05.2009 merkel maintains tax cut pledge despite party doubts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel is still standing by her promise , despite schaeuble 's comments a senior member of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet has questioned her pledge to german voters to cut taxes – exposing a deep policy rift just months before the federal election . interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , an influential figure in merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- party , told the newspaper bild am sonntag that tax relief in the current situation is unlikely .
" there is very little room for tax cuts and no one can say right now when the time will be right , " schaeuble said .
" new tax revenue estimates due later in may will show just how limited the scope for tax relief is . "
berlin is expected to slash its tax revenue estimates for 2009 by 48 billion euros -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- later this week .
however , chancellor merkel is sticking to her pledge .
in an interview on german public television , she said that tax relief could help the stimulate sluggish german economy .
" we need to mobilize all our forces to foster growth , " she said .
merkel is promising a three-pronged approach of tax relief , deficit cuts and investment in education and innovation .
schaeuble 's doubts echoed the difference in opinion does n't end with schaeuble .
several cdu state premiers had already criticized her plans to make tax relief a key plank of the party 's election campaign program .
the cdu premier of thuringia , dieter althaus , also said this weekend that his party had an obligation to be a guarantor of solid state finances .
horst seehofer , the head of the cdu 's sister party in bavaria , the christian social union , also raised his doubts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 11.05.2009 speculation abounds over future boss of a vw-porsche group großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche and vw officials have given themselves until early june to draft a merger plan german car experts are waiting to see who takes the wheel after a potential tie-up of porsche and vw .
much uncertainty remains , including who will own the auto giant and what city the company will call home . managers , lawyers and consultants from volkswagen and porsche began meetings on monday to discuss ways to bring the two german carmakers together into an integrated auto group , german press agency dpa reported , adding that it was still too early for talk among top executives . the two automakers have said they hope to be in a position to present a final merger plan by early-june , dpa reported .
many analysts have recently said negotiations will have to address a number of touchy subjects before a deal can be announced . " it 's not really clear how they will construct -lsb- the new company -rsb- , " juergen pieper from metzler bank told the afp news agency . contentious questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of both carmakers are wondering if factories will be shut or moved when company executives outlined merger plans on may 6 , they knew questions about where the resulting auto group would be based , who owns how much of the carmakers and who runs the company 's operations would be among the most contentious issues up for negotiation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 11.05.2009 pope seeks to salve holocaust wounds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict called on israeli leaders to find a solution to the middle east conflict pope benedict xvi is on his first trip to israel .
he has used a speech to seek to heal the wounds created by , among other things , his reinstatement of a holocaust-denying bishop . the pope has begun his landmark , five-day trip to israel and the palestinian territories by condemning the holocaust and lingering anti-semitism , and calling for a " just and lasting solution " to the middle east conflict .
" tragically , the jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person , " he said at tel aviv 's ben-gurion airport .
he then went on to challenge israel 's conservative government by calling for the creation of a palestinian state .
" i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the six million jewish victims of the shoah , " the german-born pope said , using the hebrew term for the holocaust , " and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude . "
benedict , only the third reigning pope to visit the region , said : " i come , like so many others before me , to pray at the holy places , to pray especially for peace - peace in the holy land and peace throughout the world . "
pope deplores anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres , right , called the pope 's visit a " mission of peace " benedict recently angered many jews by lifting the excommunication on a holocaust-denying bishop .
he caused further anger by backing the beatification of controversial nazi-era pope pius xii .
" sadly , anti-semitism continues to raise its ugly head in parts of the world , " said the pontiff , calling this " totally unacceptable " and declaring " every effort " must be made to combat anti-semitism .
in the 45 years since the second vatican council repudiated the concept of collective jewish guilt for christ 's death , catholic-jewish relations have been haunted by the holocaust and the question of what the church did , or failed to do , about it .
they went through one of their worst periods after the pope in january lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops , including one who denied that six million jews were killed .
the vatican says it had not known enough about that british bishop 's past and the church and jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to yad vashem in jerusalem , israel 's memorial to the victims of the holocaust .
calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu , left , did not directly respond to the pope 's call for a palestinian state israeli president shimon peres , the country 's official head of state whose duties are largely ceremonial , welcomed pope benedict , calling his visit to the holy land a " mission of peace " and of " planting the seeds of tolerance and uprooting the weeds of fanaticism . "
the politically moderate peres also expressed hope for a lasting peace in the middle east .
" we 've made peace with egypt and jordan and we are negotiating peace with the palestinians .
we may also arrive at a comprehensive regional peace here in the near future .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a hardliner , who since taking office in late march following february 10 elections has refrained from openly committing to the establishment of a palestinian state , did not make a speech at the airport .
" it 's a pleasure to welcome you to the holy land , " he said as he shook benedict 's hand once the pontiff alighted from the royal jordanian aircraft , which had flown him from amman , jordan , where he had arrived on friday .
a " religious pilgrimage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope toured a mosque during a visit to jordan the catholic church has made a point of emphasizing that this is not a state visit by the head of the vatican , but a non-political , religious pilgrimage by its spiritual leader .
yet the visit is being seen as another milestone in israel-vatican relations , which have been historically tumultuous and were only formalized in 1993 .
the first reigning pope to visit was paul xi in 1964 , who made a one-day stopover from jordan , but refrained from mentioning israel by name , or meeting israeli leaders in jerusalem .
the second was john paul ii , who made a highly successful and emotional visit in 2000 .
after his stop at the airport , the pontiff later flew by israeli military helicopter to jerusalem .
the pope planned to visit the memorial of jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust remembrance institute .
but he had no plans to visit the museum , which accuses pope pius xii of being silent in the face of the suffering of the jews . nt / pfd , reuters / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" tragically , the jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person , " he said at tel aviv 's ben-gurion airport .
he then went on to challenge israel 's conservative government by calling for the creation of a palestinian state .
" i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the six million jewish victims of the shoah , " the german-born pope said , using the hebrew term for the holocaust , " and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude . "
benedict , only the third reigning pope to visit the region , said : " i come , like so many others before me , to pray at the holy places , to pray especially for peace - peace in the holy land and peace throughout the world . "
pope deplores anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres , right , called the pope 's visit a " mission of peace " benedict recently angered many jews by lifting the excommunication on a holocaust-denying bishop .
he caused further anger by backing the beatification of controversial nazi-era pope pius xii .
" sadly , anti-semitism continues to raise its ugly head in parts of the world , " said the pontiff , calling this " totally unacceptable " and declaring " every effort " must be made to combat anti-semitism .
in the 45 years since the second vatican council repudiated the concept of collective jewish guilt for christ 's death , catholic-jewish relations have been haunted by the holocaust and the question of what the church did , or failed to do , about it .
they went through one of their worst periods after the pope in january lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops , including one who denied that six million jews were killed .
the vatican says it had not known enough about that british bishop 's past and the church and jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to yad vashem in jerusalem , israel 's memorial to the victims of the holocaust .
calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu , left , did not directly respond to the pope 's call for a palestinian state israeli president shimon peres , the country 's official head of state whose duties are largely ceremonial , welcomed pope benedict , calling his visit to the holy land a " mission of peace " and of " planting the seeds of tolerance and uprooting the weeds of fanaticism . "
the politically moderate peres also expressed hope for a lasting peace in the middle east .
" we 've made peace with egypt and jordan and we are negotiating peace with the palestinians .
we may also arrive at a comprehensive regional peace here in the near future .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a hardliner , who since taking office in late march following february 10 elections has refrained from openly committing to the establishment of a palestinian state , did not make a speech at the airport .
" it 's a pleasure to welcome you to the holy land , " he said as he shook benedict 's hand once the pontiff alighted from the royal jordanian aircraft , which had flown him from amman , jordan , where he had arrived on friday .
a " religious pilgrimage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope toured a mosque during a visit to jordan the catholic church has made a point of emphasizing that this is not a state visit by the head of the vatican , but a non-political , religious pilgrimage by its spiritual leader .
yet the visit is being seen as another milestone in israel-vatican relations , which have been historically tumultuous and were only formalized in 1993 .
the first reigning pope to visit was paul xi in 1964 , who made a one-day stopover from jordan , but refrained from mentioning israel by name , or meeting israeli leaders in jerusalem .
the second was john paul ii , who made a highly successful and emotional visit in 2000 .
after his stop at the airport , the pontiff later flew by israeli military helicopter to jerusalem .
the pope planned to visit the memorial of jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust remembrance institute .
but he had no plans to visit the museum , which accuses pope pius xii of being silent in the face of the suffering of the jews . nt / pfd , reuters / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" basically if you did n't have oceans you would n't have a climate ... that sort of link and understanding is n't being talked about in climate change discussions , " jacqueline alder , head of the marine unit of the united nations environment program told news agency afp . the conference , which opened monday and lasts until friday , has drawn environmental experts , officials and ministers from 120 nations .
one of the main aims is to create a forum to coordinate international conservation efforts to counter the impact of rising sea levels and dwindling fish stocks blamed on higher temperatures . scientists warn of dramatic consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is tight for the conference in manado , sulawesi richard spinrad of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- said scientists are no longer ruling out a rise in sea levels by a whole meter in this century .
the world 's oceans absorb 22 million tons of carbon dioxide daily and acidity levels have risen by a third over the last 100 years , he added . scientists also say rising temperatures and over-fishing could lead to the collapse of key species that feed millions and help preserve vital ecosystems . " we 've calculated that if carbon emissions are n't cut , then in the long-term we 'll see the creation of large death zones in the seas at a depth of 200 and 800 meters which will hardly have any oxygen , " hans joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate change research told german newspaper die zeit recently . schellnhuber , who is chancellor angela merkel 's advisor on climate change , warned of dramatic consequences for fishing and world food supplies . indonesia pushes for special status for oceans indonesia , an archipelago nation of 17,000 islands , is pushing for recognition of the role of oceans in absorbing carbon dioxide which is blamed for global warming .
the government in jakarta has said it wants special status for oceans written into the successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . " it is clear that our precious marine resources are under dire and increasing threat and that in many parts of the world climate change will accelerate their destruction , " indonesian maritime affairs and fisheries minister freddy numberi said .
" adaptation and mitigation measures are urgently needed to be taken up not only to save marine and coastal resources but also to save the coastal communities . " saving coastal communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 150 million people in indonesia 's rely on the sea for their livelihood an estimated 150 people in the region are dependant on the ocean for their livelihood .
but pollution , tourism and illegal fishing have caused huge damage to indonesia 's marine ecosystems . " for the people here , the ocean provides everything they need to live - much more than in industrialized nations .
they 're totally dependant on the ocean 's resources , " tim jennerjahn , a biochemist at the leibnitz center for marine tropical ecology in bremen told german public broadcaster zdf . jennerjahn , who heads a joint german-indonesian project for the protection of indonesia 's coastline , said the aim was to create a sustainable coastal management system .
" that 's why it 's important that we present the project at the world ocean conference , " he said . meanwhile , leaders from six countries - east timor , indonesia , malaysia , papua new guinea , the philippines and the solomon islands - will meet on the margins of the conference to launch a plan to save the coral triangle , a vast underwater ecosystem that is home to more than half the world 's coral reefs . sp / sms , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has used a speech to seek to heal the wounds created by , among other things , his reinstatement of a holocaust-denying bishop . the pope has begun his landmark , five-day trip to israel and the palestinian territories by condemning the holocaust and lingering anti-semitism , and calling for a " just and lasting solution " to the middle east conflict .
" tragically , the jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person , " he said at tel aviv 's ben-gurion airport .
he then went on to challenge israel 's conservative government by calling for the creation of a palestinian state .
" i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the six million jewish victims of the shoah , " the german-born pope said , using the hebrew term for the holocaust , " and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude . "
benedict , only the third reigning pope to visit the region , said : " i come , like so many others before me , to pray at the holy places , to pray especially for peace - peace in the holy land and peace throughout the world . "
pope deplores anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres , right , called the pope 's visit a " mission of peace " benedict recently angered many jews by lifting the excommunication on a holocaust-denying bishop .
he caused further anger by backing the beatification of controversial nazi-era pope pius xii .
" sadly , anti-semitism continues to raise its ugly head in parts of the world , " said the pontiff , calling this " totally unacceptable " and declaring " every effort " must be made to combat anti-semitism .
in the 45 years since the second vatican council repudiated the concept of collective jewish guilt for christ 's death , catholic-jewish relations have been haunted by the holocaust and the question of what the church did , or failed to do , about it .
they went through one of their worst periods after the pope in january lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops , including one who denied that six million jews were killed .
the vatican says it had not known enough about that british bishop 's past and the church and jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to yad vashem in jerusalem , israel 's memorial to the victims of the holocaust .
calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu , left , did not directly respond to the pope 's call for a palestinian state israeli president shimon peres , the country 's official head of state whose duties are largely ceremonial , welcomed pope benedict , calling his visit to the holy land a " mission of peace " and of " planting the seeds of tolerance and uprooting the weeds of fanaticism . "
the politically moderate peres also expressed hope for a lasting peace in the middle east .
" we 've made peace with egypt and jordan and we are negotiating peace with the palestinians .
we may also arrive at a comprehensive regional peace here in the near future .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a hardliner , who since taking office in late march following february 10 elections has refrained from openly committing to the establishment of a palestinian state , did not make a speech at the airport .
" it 's a pleasure to welcome you to the holy land , " he said as he shook benedict 's hand once the pontiff alighted from the royal jordanian aircraft , which had flown him from amman , jordan , where he had arrived on friday .
a " religious pilgrimage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope toured a mosque during a visit to jordan the catholic church has made a point of emphasizing that this is not a state visit by the head of the vatican , but a non-political , religious pilgrimage by its spiritual leader .
yet the visit is being seen as another milestone in israel-vatican relations , which have been historically tumultuous and were only formalized in 1993 .
the first reigning pope to visit was paul xi in 1964 , who made a one-day stopover from jordan , but refrained from mentioning israel by name , or meeting israeli leaders in jerusalem .
the second was john paul ii , who made a highly successful and emotional visit in 2000 .
after his stop at the airport , the pontiff later flew by israeli military helicopter to jerusalem .
the pope planned to visit the memorial of jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust remembrance institute .

he has used a speech to seek to heal the wounds created by , among other things , his reinstatement of a holocaust-denying bishop . the pope has begun his landmark , five-day trip to israel and the palestinian territories by condemning the holocaust and lingering anti-semitism , and calling for a " just and lasting solution " to the middle east conflict .
" tragically , the jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person , " he said at tel aviv 's ben-gurion airport .
he then went on to challenge israel 's conservative government by calling for the creation of a palestinian state .
" i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the six million jewish victims of the shoah , " the german-born pope said , using the hebrew term for the holocaust , " and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude . "
benedict , only the third reigning pope to visit the region , said : " i come , like so many others before me , to pray at the holy places , to pray especially for peace - peace in the holy land and peace throughout the world . "
pope deplores anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres , right , called the pope 's visit a " mission of peace " benedict recently angered many jews by lifting the excommunication on a holocaust-denying bishop .
he caused further anger by backing the beatification of controversial nazi-era pope pius xii .
" sadly , anti-semitism continues to raise its ugly head in parts of the world , " said the pontiff , calling this " totally unacceptable " and declaring " every effort " must be made to combat anti-semitism .
in the 45 years since the second vatican council repudiated the concept of collective jewish guilt for christ 's death , catholic-jewish relations have been haunted by the holocaust and the question of what the church did , or failed to do , about it .
they went through one of their worst periods after the pope in january lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops , including one who denied that six million jews were killed .
the vatican says it had not known enough about that british bishop 's past and the church and jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to yad vashem in jerusalem , israel 's memorial to the victims of the holocaust .
calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu , left , did not directly respond to the pope 's call for a palestinian state israeli president shimon peres , the country 's official head of state whose duties are largely ceremonial , welcomed pope benedict , calling his visit to the holy land a " mission of peace " and of " planting the seeds of tolerance and uprooting the weeds of fanaticism . "
the politically moderate peres also expressed hope for a lasting peace in the middle east .
" we 've made peace with egypt and jordan and we are negotiating peace with the palestinians .
we may also arrive at a comprehensive regional peace here in the near future .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a hardliner , who since taking office in late march following february 10 elections has refrained from openly committing to the establishment of a palestinian state , did not make a speech at the airport .
" it 's a pleasure to welcome you to the holy land , " he said as he shook benedict 's hand once the pontiff alighted from the royal jordanian aircraft , which had flown him from amman , jordan , where he had arrived on friday .
a " religious pilgrimage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope toured a mosque during a visit to jordan the catholic church has made a point of emphasizing that this is not a state visit by the head of the vatican , but a non-political , religious pilgrimage by its spiritual leader .
yet the visit is being seen as another milestone in israel-vatican relations , which have been historically tumultuous and were only formalized in 1993 .
the first reigning pope to visit was paul xi in 1964 , who made a one-day stopover from jordan , but refrained from mentioning israel by name , or meeting israeli leaders in jerusalem .
the second was john paul ii , who made a highly successful and emotional visit in 2000 .
after his stop at the airport , the pontiff later flew by israeli military helicopter to jerusalem .
the pope planned to visit the memorial of jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust remembrance institute .
but he had no plans to visit the museum , which accuses pope pius xii of being silent in the face of the suffering of the jews . nt / pfd , reuters / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " iron men " - as they are popularly known - have gained notoriety over the past 11 months as their unique fans have been tranforming their old stadium into a modern soccer arena .
" this is the most unique experience of my career , " sylvia weisheit told dw radio .
weisheit , who has been a die-hard union berlin fan for the past three decades , is the manager of the stadium construction project .
" the fans spend their free time and holidays working at the constuction site .
they are totally committed to the community , and any company would be glad to have such workers . "
the middle-aged blonde is one of only about six to 10 professional builders at the site .
the rest of the 60 to 80 workers turning up each morning at 7 a.m. are union supporters .
iron men with an iron will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union fans toil for club glory since construction of the new stadium began last june , around 1,600 volunteers have put in an estimated 90,000 hours of work .
they have saved the club two million euros from the overall construction costs of 15 million euros .
the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- had threatend to close the club ’ s old forestry stadium , which dates back to the 1920s .
dfb offcials said it no longer met the security requirements of professional soccer in germany .
michael - or " kibi " as he likes to be known - said the dfb 's decision was a test of union supporters unique fan culture .
describing the club as a big family bound together by more than just football he said : " union is a social event .
we ’ ve got the spirit of a neighborhood club where everyone sticks together . "
the stadium construction project was proof , he said , that it is possible to combine " commercial soccer with preserving the club 's century-old tradition . "
iron men defy odds and oppression fc union berlin was founded in 1906 by metalworkers in the industrial district of koepenick in the east of the city .
union supporters ‘ rapturous chant " eisern union " - meaning " iron union " - first echoed through the old forestry stadium in the 1920s .
after world war two , berlin was divided and union berlin played in the leagues of the then communist east germany .
union berlin enjoyed cult status as the club of non-conformists and of all east berliners opposing the regime .
their eternal rivals in the city were bfc dynamo , a club run by the dreaded stasi secret police .
" they had a lot of money and they had the best players , " recalls thommy thiele , an union fan since he was 13 years old .
" we hated the bfc dynamo , we hated the secret service , we hated the berlin wall , we were in opposition to the state , " he told dw radio .
" that ’ s why in the 1980s there were over 20,000 people in the fc union stadium every match and only 5,000 people at bfc dynamo . "
after german unification in 1990 , fc union berlin experienced difficult economic times in professional soccer .
the club frequently hovered on the brink of insolvency .
there were fan protests at berlin ’ s brandenburg gate to force the city government to transform the stadium into club property .
in 2004 , union supporters donated blood to earn enough funds for the club to get dfb approval to play the next season .
new stadium ushers in new era those trying days have forged the club together , the fans say .
" the manager , the president , the coach , the team and the supporters make up a whole system , " says thommy thiele .
" dirk zingler , our president , was standing in the stadium behind me 20 years ago .
he is one of us , a part of the family . "
while the hard-working fans sweat it out on the stadium terraces , they can watch the players give their all on the training ground right next door .
to see the new oval rise from the rubble of the old stadium has been a huge boost for the team ’ s morale , said club coach uwe neuhaus .
" the team is well aware of the close bonds within the club .
this is something special and is currently being underscored by the fans very impressively . "
on saturday , coach neuhaus and the team paid back their debt to the fans by clinching promotion to the second division .
ironically , the victory came in the stadium of the hated bfc dynamo , where the team has played throughout the season .

but even if the club will have to struggle commercially , as well as on the pitch , the iron-willed union community can never be broken up .
" we have to maintain our spirit .
we have a lot of common people in our community and there is not a lot of money .
in the third division , the second division , the first division or the fourth division , i don ’ t care .
fc union is important , not the league we play in . "
the new old forestry stadium is to be officially be inaugurated on july 8 , 2008 with a friendly against berlin ’ s top club hertha bsc .

" basically if you did n't have oceans you would n't have a climate ... that sort of link and understanding is n't being talked about in climate change discussions , " jacqueline alder , head of the marine unit of the united nations environment program told news agency afp . the conference , which opened monday and lasts until friday , has drawn environmental experts , officials and ministers from 120 nations .
one of the main aims is to create a forum to coordinate international conservation efforts to counter the impact of rising sea levels and dwindling fish stocks blamed on higher temperatures . scientists warn of dramatic consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is tight for the conference in manado , sulawesi richard spinrad of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- said scientists are no longer ruling out a rise in sea levels by a whole meter in this century .
the world 's oceans absorb 22 million tons of carbon dioxide daily and acidity levels have risen by a third over the last 100 years , he added . scientists also say rising temperatures and over-fishing could lead to the collapse of key species that feed millions and help preserve vital ecosystems . " we 've calculated that if carbon emissions are n't cut , then in the long-term we 'll see the creation of large death zones in the seas at a depth of 200 and 800 meters which will hardly have any oxygen , " hans joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate change research told german newspaper die zeit recently . schellnhuber , who is chancellor angela merkel 's advisor on climate change , warned of dramatic consequences for fishing and world food supplies . indonesia pushes for special status for oceans indonesia , an archipelago nation of 17,000 islands , is pushing for recognition of the role of oceans in absorbing carbon dioxide which is blamed for global warming .
the government in jakarta has said it wants special status for oceans written into the successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . " it is clear that our precious marine resources are under dire and increasing threat and that in many parts of the world climate change will accelerate their destruction , " indonesian maritime affairs and fisheries minister freddy numberi said .
" adaptation and mitigation measures are urgently needed to be taken up not only to save marine and coastal resources but also to save the coastal communities . " saving coastal communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 150 million people in indonesia 's rely on the sea for their livelihood an estimated 150 people in the region are dependant on the ocean for their livelihood .
but pollution , tourism and illegal fishing have caused huge damage to indonesia 's marine ecosystems . " for the people here , the ocean provides everything they need to live - much more than in industrialized nations .
they 're totally dependant on the ocean 's resources , " tim jennerjahn , a biochemist at the leibnitz center for marine tropical ecology in bremen told german public broadcaster zdf . jennerjahn , who heads a joint german-indonesian project for the protection of indonesia 's coastline , said the aim was to create a sustainable coastal management system .
" that 's why it 's important that we present the project at the world ocean conference , " he said . meanwhile , leaders from six countries - east timor , indonesia , malaysia , papua new guinea , the philippines and the solomon islands - will meet on the margins of the conference to launch a plan to save the coral triangle , a vast underwater ecosystem that is home to more than half the world 's coral reefs . sp / sms , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" basically if you did n't have oceans you would n't have a climate ... that sort of link and understanding is n't being talked about in climate change discussions , " jacqueline alder , head of the marine unit of the united nations environment program told news agency afp . the conference , which opened monday and lasts until friday , has drawn environmental experts , officials and ministers from 120 nations .
one of the main aims is to create a forum to coordinate international conservation efforts to counter the impact of rising sea levels and dwindling fish stocks blamed on higher temperatures . scientists warn of dramatic consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is tight for the conference in manado , sulawesi richard spinrad of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- said scientists are no longer ruling out a rise in sea levels by a whole meter in this century .
the world 's oceans absorb 22 million tons of carbon dioxide daily and acidity levels have risen by a third over the last 100 years , he added . scientists also say rising temperatures and over-fishing could lead to the collapse of key species that feed millions and help preserve vital ecosystems . " we 've calculated that if carbon emissions are n't cut , then in the long-term we 'll see the creation of large death zones in the seas at a depth of 200 and 800 meters which will hardly have any oxygen , " hans joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate change research told german newspaper die zeit recently . schellnhuber , who is chancellor angela merkel 's advisor on climate change , warned of dramatic consequences for fishing and world food supplies . indonesia pushes for special status for oceans indonesia , an archipelago nation of 17,000 islands , is pushing for recognition of the role of oceans in absorbing carbon dioxide which is blamed for global warming .
the government in jakarta has said it wants special status for oceans written into the successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . " it is clear that our precious marine resources are under dire and increasing threat and that in many parts of the world climate change will accelerate their destruction , " indonesian maritime affairs and fisheries minister freddy numberi said .
" adaptation and mitigation measures are urgently needed to be taken up not only to save marine and coastal resources but also to save the coastal communities . " saving coastal communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 150 million people in indonesia 's rely on the sea for their livelihood an estimated 150 people in the region are dependant on the ocean for their livelihood .
but pollution , tourism and illegal fishing have caused huge damage to indonesia 's marine ecosystems . " for the people here , the ocean provides everything they need to live - much more than in industrialized nations .
they 're totally dependant on the ocean 's resources , " tim jennerjahn , a biochemist at the leibnitz center for marine tropical ecology in bremen told german public broadcaster zdf . jennerjahn , who heads a joint german-indonesian project for the protection of indonesia 's coastline , said the aim was to create a sustainable coastal management system .
" that 's why it 's important that we present the project at the world ocean conference , " he said . meanwhile , leaders from six countries - east timor , indonesia , malaysia , papua new guinea , the philippines and the solomon islands - will meet on the margins of the conference to launch a plan to save the coral triangle , a vast underwater ecosystem that is home to more than half the world 's coral reefs . sp / sms , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 've calculated that if carbon emissions are n't cut , then in the long-term we 'll see the creation of large death zones in the seas at a depth of 200 and 800 meters which will hardly have any oxygen , " hans joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate change research told german newspaper die zeit recently . schellnhuber , who is chancellor angela merkel 's advisor on climate change , warned of dramatic consequences for fishing and world food supplies . indonesia pushes for special status for oceans indonesia , an archipelago nation of 17,000 islands , is pushing for recognition of the role of oceans in absorbing carbon dioxide which is blamed for global warming .
the government in jakarta has said it wants special status for oceans written into the successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . " it is clear that our precious marine resources are under dire and increasing threat and that in many parts of the world climate change will accelerate their destruction , " indonesian maritime affairs and fisheries minister freddy numberi said .
" adaptation and mitigation measures are urgently needed to be taken up not only to save marine and coastal resources but also to save the coastal communities . " saving coastal communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 150 million people in indonesia 's rely on the sea for their livelihood an estimated 150 people in the region are dependant on the ocean for their livelihood .
but pollution , tourism and illegal fishing have caused huge damage to indonesia 's marine ecosystems . " for the people here , the ocean provides everything they need to live - much more than in industrialized nations .
they 're totally dependant on the ocean 's resources , " tim jennerjahn , a biochemist at the leibnitz center for marine tropical ecology in bremen told german public broadcaster zdf . jennerjahn , who heads a joint german-indonesian project for the protection of indonesia 's coastline , said the aim was to create a sustainable coastal management system .
" that 's why it 's important that we present the project at the world ocean conference , " he said . meanwhile , leaders from six countries - east timor , indonesia , malaysia , papua new guinea , the philippines and the solomon islands - will meet on the margins of the conference to launch a plan to save the coral triangle , a vast underwater ecosystem that is home to more than half the world 's coral reefs . sp / sms , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

between 2002 and 2005 , an estimated 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- in bribes are thought to have been paid out , the majority of it to customers outside of germany .
prosecutors did not specify exactly how many people were being investigated , but said the number is " well over 100 . "
that figure includes both man marketing staff and customers suspected of having taken illegal payoffs .
about 300 police personnel across germany are involved in the probe .

prosecutors said the top management at man had not been implicated in the allegations , which arose after a tip-off from tax authorities .
the inquiry comes on the heels of a corruption scandal at engineering and telecommunications giant siemens in 2006 .
investigators found that siemens staff had set up slush funds to pay " commissions " to secure contracts .
the affair led to a major restructuring at siemens and the company later agreed to pay one billion euros in fines .

the vatican says it did not know enough about the bishop 's past and both sides now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit to jerusalem 's yad vashem memorial to holocaust victims .
most jewish leaders now consider the episode to have been put to rest - but not all .
the dorot hemeshech association of holocaust survivors has called on drivers to blow their car horns during the pope 's speech at yad vashem .
" israelis will this way express their disapproval of the pope who encourages holocaust denial and anti-semitism , " the association said .
the german-born pontiff 's membership in the hitler youth , although it was forced , has also angered holocaust survivors .
in addition , a group of far-right activists has said they plan to press criminal charges against the pope over vatican treasures they claim were plundered from jewish people , while nitzan horowitz , a gay rights activist and a left-wing parliamentarian , will boycott all official ceremonies held for the pope .
" pope benedict xvi is responsible for the suffering of thousands of people in the world , " horowitz said .
" he conveys a message of extremism and insensitivity , " he added , referring to a papal warning that condom use could be aggravating africa 's aids crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pm netanyahu has not yet endorsed the idea of a palestinian state pope to meet israeli and palestinian leaders during his five-day visit , pope benedict will hold talks with israeli and palestinian leaders .
he is expected to repeat his offer for the catholic church to do all it can to help the stalled peace process .
the vatican supports a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which also has internationally backing .
pope benedict will be welcomed by israeli president shimon peres and the country 's new , right-leaning prime minister , benjamin netanyahu .
since being sworn in to power at the end of march , netanyahu has so far refused to publicly endorse the creation of a palestinian state .
he did , however , say on sunday that israel will try to ease restrictions on palestinians in the west bank .
" i think we need to make a big effort , within the given security constraints , to make things easier for the palestinians , " netanyahu reportedly told ministers during a cabinet meeting .
after welcoming the pope , prime minister netanyahu heads to egypt , on his first trip to the arab world since he took office .
egypt is looking for netanyahu to support and endorse palestinian independence .

" there is very little room for tax cuts and no one can say right now when the time will be right , " schaeuble said .
" new tax revenue estimates due later in may will show just how limited the scope for tax relief is . "
berlin is expected to slash its tax revenue estimates for 2009 by 48 billion euros -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- later this week .
however , chancellor merkel is sticking to her pledge .
in an interview on german public television , she said that tax relief could help the stimulate sluggish german economy .
" we need to mobilize all our forces to foster growth , " she said .
merkel is promising a three-pronged approach of tax relief , deficit cuts and investment in education and innovation .
schaeuble 's doubts echoed the difference in opinion does n't end with schaeuble .
several cdu state premiers had already criticized her plans to make tax relief a key plank of the party 's election campaign program .
the cdu premier of thuringia , dieter althaus , also said this weekend that his party had an obligation to be a guarantor of solid state finances .
horst seehofer , the head of the cdu 's sister party in bavaria , the christian social union , also raised his doubts .
" one is not allowed to make promises that one ca n't keep to , " he said .
the divisions over the tax issue could hurt merkel in september 's election , despite her current lead of 10 points over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , her partners in government .
merkel had been hoping she would coast to re-election this year on her economic record and the promise of tax cuts .
things look rather different now , however , as the global financial crisis has plunged germany into its deepest recession since world war ii and the economic and fiscal gains from her first three years in office now just a distant memory . cg / jk , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reports say more than 14 million euros were paid in a kickback scheme over several years . prosecutors in munich said they have reason to believe that the german truck maker had a system in place to " boost the sales of trucks and buses . "
that system allegedly included illegal payouts to man customers .
at times , bank accounts of relatives and friends were used to disguise the transactions , according to prosecutors .
between 2002 and 2005 , an estimated 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- in bribes are thought to have been paid out , the majority of it to customers outside of germany .
prosecutors did not specify exactly how many people were being investigated , but said the number is " well over 100 . "
that figure includes both man marketing staff and customers suspected of having taken illegal payoffs .
about 300 police personnel across germany are involved in the probe .

following an aborted action by germany 's elite anti-terrorism police unit , the gsg 9 , to free a kidnapped freighter in somalia , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble wants to broaden the mandate of the bundeswehr . by a constitutional change the german military would be made responsible for an area which has until now been the province of the police .
" under the constitution , the gsg 9 is responsible for these kind of eventualities , but really , it should be the military 's duty .
for them to do this duty , though , we have to lay the legal foundations , and that means changing the constitution , " schaeuble said in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble , pushing for constitutional change the minister said it was decided to send the gsg 9 to africa because the bundeswehr alone could n't come up with the necessary resources to carry out a hostage liberation at sea .
shortly before the planned operation could take place , consultations with the officer in command led to its cancellation .
before the gsg 9 could reach the scene , the kidnappers had brought the ship into port .
the situation became much more dangerous , as more pirates had gone aboard and the risk that police or hostages could be killed in an operation became too high .
the weekly magazine der spiegel tells the story somewhat differently .
the magazine says a gsg 9 dress rehearsal aboard the us helicopter ship " boxer " was a success , but at the last minute the us withdrew support for the operation .
der spiegel also blamed coordination difficulties between the operational commander and high command in berlin .
on top of that , they say there were conflicts between the gsg 9 and the bundeswehr .
the gsg 9 are better trained for hostage operations than the military 's special forces , but for the transport abroad they depended on the army .
schaeuble said the constitutional changes he has recommended are provided for under the coalition agreement between the christian democratic union and the social democratic party , but he criticized that the social democrats have so far blocked the changes . ch / ai , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following an aborted action by germany 's elite anti-terrorism police unit , the gsg 9 , to free a kidnapped freighter in somalia , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble wants to broaden the mandate of the bundeswehr . by a constitutional change the german military would be made responsible for an area which has until now been the province of the police .
" under the constitution , the gsg 9 is responsible for these kind of eventualities , but really , it should be the military 's duty .
for them to do this duty , though , we have to lay the legal foundations , and that means changing the constitution , " schaeuble said in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble , pushing for constitutional change the minister said it was decided to send the gsg 9 to africa because the bundeswehr alone could n't come up with the necessary resources to carry out a hostage liberation at sea .
shortly before the planned operation could take place , consultations with the officer in command led to its cancellation .
before the gsg 9 could reach the scene , the kidnappers had brought the ship into port .
the situation became much more dangerous , as more pirates had gone aboard and the risk that police or hostages could be killed in an operation became too high .
the weekly magazine der spiegel tells the story somewhat differently .
the magazine says a gsg 9 dress rehearsal aboard the us helicopter ship " boxer " was a success , but at the last minute the us withdrew support for the operation .
der spiegel also blamed coordination difficulties between the operational commander and high command in berlin .
on top of that , they say there were conflicts between the gsg 9 and the bundeswehr .
the gsg 9 are better trained for hostage operations than the military 's special forces , but for the transport abroad they depended on the army .
schaeuble said the constitutional changes he has recommended are provided for under the coalition agreement between the christian democratic union and the social democratic party , but he criticized that the social democrats have so far blocked the changes . ch / ai , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " iron men " - as they are popularly known - have gained notoriety over the past 11 months as their unique fans have been tranforming their old stadium into a modern soccer arena .
" this is the most unique experience of my career , " sylvia weisheit told dw radio .
weisheit , who has been a die-hard union berlin fan for the past three decades , is the manager of the stadium construction project .
" the fans spend their free time and holidays working at the constuction site .
they are totally committed to the community , and any company would be glad to have such workers . "

describing the club as a big family bound together by more than just football he said : " union is a social event .

the stadium construction project was proof , he said , that it is possible to combine " commercial soccer with preserving the club 's century-old tradition . "
iron men defy odds and oppression fc union berlin was founded in 1906 by metalworkers in the industrial district of koepenick in the east of the city .
union supporters ‘ rapturous chant " eisern union " - meaning " iron union " - first echoed through the old forestry stadium in the 1920s .
after world war two , berlin was divided and union berlin played in the leagues of the then communist east germany .
union berlin enjoyed cult status as the club of non-conformists and of all east berliners opposing the regime .
their eternal rivals in the city were bfc dynamo , a club run by the dreaded stasi secret police .
" they had a lot of money and they had the best players , " recalls thommy thiele , an union fan since he was 13 years old .
" we hated the bfc dynamo , we hated the secret service , we hated the berlin wall , we were in opposition to the state , " he told dw radio .
" that ’ s why in the 1980s there were over 20,000 people in the fc union stadium every match and only 5,000 people at bfc dynamo . "
after german unification in 1990 , fc union berlin experienced difficult economic times in professional soccer .
the club frequently hovered on the brink of insolvency .
there were fan protests at berlin ’ s brandenburg gate to force the city government to transform the stadium into club property .
in 2004 , union supporters donated blood to earn enough funds for the club to get dfb approval to play the next season .
new stadium ushers in new era those trying days have forged the club together , the fans say .

he is one of us , a part of the family . "
while the hard-working fans sweat it out on the stadium terraces , they can watch the players give their all on the training ground right next door .
to see the new oval rise from the rubble of the old stadium has been a huge boost for the team ’ s morale , said club coach uwe neuhaus .
" the team is well aware of the close bonds within the club .
this is something special and is currently being underscored by the fans very impressively . "
on saturday , coach neuhaus and the team paid back their debt to the fans by clinching promotion to the second division .

following an aborted action by germany 's elite anti-terrorism police unit , the gsg 9 , to free a kidnapped freighter in somalia , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble wants to broaden the mandate of the bundeswehr . by a constitutional change the german military would be made responsible for an area which has until now been the province of the police .
" under the constitution , the gsg 9 is responsible for these kind of eventualities , but really , it should be the military 's duty .
for them to do this duty , though , we have to lay the legal foundations , and that means changing the constitution , " schaeuble said in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble , pushing for constitutional change the minister said it was decided to send the gsg 9 to africa because the bundeswehr alone could n't come up with the necessary resources to carry out a hostage liberation at sea .
shortly before the planned operation could take place , consultations with the officer in command led to its cancellation .
before the gsg 9 could reach the scene , the kidnappers had brought the ship into port .
the situation became much more dangerous , as more pirates had gone aboard and the risk that police or hostages could be killed in an operation became too high .
the weekly magazine der spiegel tells the story somewhat differently .
the magazine says a gsg 9 dress rehearsal aboard the us helicopter ship " boxer " was a success , but at the last minute the us withdrew support for the operation .
der spiegel also blamed coordination difficulties between the operational commander and high command in berlin .
on top of that , they say there were conflicts between the gsg 9 and the bundeswehr .
the gsg 9 are better trained for hostage operations than the military 's special forces , but for the transport abroad they depended on the army .
schaeuble said the constitutional changes he has recommended are provided for under the coalition agreement between the christian democratic union and the social democratic party , but he criticized that the social democrats have so far blocked the changes . ch / ai , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reports say more than 14 million euros were paid in a kickback scheme over several years . prosecutors in munich said they have reason to believe that the german truck maker had a system in place to " boost the sales of trucks and buses . "
that system allegedly included illegal payouts to man customers .

between 2002 and 2005 , an estimated 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- in bribes are thought to have been paid out , the majority of it to customers outside of germany .
prosecutors did not specify exactly how many people were being investigated , but said the number is " well over 100 . "
that figure includes both man marketing staff and customers suspected of having taken illegal payoffs .
about 300 police personnel across germany are involved in the probe .

the inquiry comes on the heels of a corruption scandal at engineering and telecommunications giant siemens in 2006 .
investigators found that siemens staff had set up slush funds to pay " commissions " to secure contracts .
the affair led to a major restructuring at siemens and the company later agreed to pay one billion euros in fines .

" there is very little room for tax cuts and no one can say right now when the time will be right , " schaeuble said .
" new tax revenue estimates due later in may will show just how limited the scope for tax relief is . "
berlin is expected to slash its tax revenue estimates for 2009 by 48 billion euros -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- later this week .
however , chancellor merkel is sticking to her pledge .
in an interview on german public television , she said that tax relief could help the stimulate sluggish german economy .
" we need to mobilize all our forces to foster growth , " she said .
merkel is promising a three-pronged approach of tax relief , deficit cuts and investment in education and innovation .
schaeuble 's doubts echoed the difference in opinion does n't end with schaeuble .
several cdu state premiers had already criticized her plans to make tax relief a key plank of the party 's election campaign program .
the cdu premier of thuringia , dieter althaus , also said this weekend that his party had an obligation to be a guarantor of solid state finances .
horst seehofer , the head of the cdu 's sister party in bavaria , the christian social union , also raised his doubts .
" one is not allowed to make promises that one ca n't keep to , " he said .
the divisions over the tax issue could hurt merkel in september 's election , despite her current lead of 10 points over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , her partners in government .
merkel had been hoping she would coast to re-election this year on her economic record and the promise of tax cuts .
things look rather different now , however , as the global financial crisis has plunged germany into its deepest recession since world war ii and the economic and fiscal gains from her first three years in office now just a distant memory . cg / jk , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vatican says it did not know enough about the bishop 's past and both sides now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit to jerusalem 's yad vashem memorial to holocaust victims .
most jewish leaders now consider the episode to have been put to rest - but not all .
the dorot hemeshech association of holocaust survivors has called on drivers to blow their car horns during the pope 's speech at yad vashem .
" israelis will this way express their disapproval of the pope who encourages holocaust denial and anti-semitism , " the association said .
the german-born pontiff 's membership in the hitler youth , although it was forced , has also angered holocaust survivors .
in addition , a group of far-right activists has said they plan to press criminal charges against the pope over vatican treasures they claim were plundered from jewish people , while nitzan horowitz , a gay rights activist and a left-wing parliamentarian , will boycott all official ceremonies held for the pope .
" pope benedict xvi is responsible for the suffering of thousands of people in the world , " horowitz said .
" he conveys a message of extremism and insensitivity , " he added , referring to a papal warning that condom use could be aggravating africa 's aids crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pm netanyahu has not yet endorsed the idea of a palestinian state pope to meet israeli and palestinian leaders during his five-day visit , pope benedict will hold talks with israeli and palestinian leaders .

he says the drug 's efficacy has so far only been proven in lab tests . countries have to be provided with data on whether the drug tamiflu is effective in fighting swine flu in humans before millions are spent stockpiling the anti-viral drug , according to bernd muehlbauer , the head of the institute for pharmacology at the bremen-mitte clinic . " we absolutely do not know whether it helps with swine flu , " muehlbauer said in an interview with german news magazine der spiegel .
" the efficacy has only been shown in the lab .
one should first prove that this medication actually works against this new kind of pathogen before one damages the economy by shelling out millions on tamiflu . " muehlbauer said tamiflu 's effectiveness in fighting the normal flu had also been widely overstated , pointing out that on average the anti-viral drug reduced the length of the illness by just one day . the expert also criticized a recent move by british authorities to administer tamiflu to an entire school after it was discovered that five students were infected with the h1n1 virus .

following an aborted action by germany 's elite anti-terrorism police unit , the gsg 9 , to free a kidnapped freighter in somalia , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble wants to broaden the mandate of the bundeswehr . by a constitutional change the german military would be made responsible for an area which has until now been the province of the police .
" under the constitution , the gsg 9 is responsible for these kind of eventualities , but really , it should be the military 's duty .
for them to do this duty , though , we have to lay the legal foundations , and that means changing the constitution , " schaeuble said in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble , pushing for constitutional change the minister said it was decided to send the gsg 9 to africa because the bundeswehr alone could n't come up with the necessary resources to carry out a hostage liberation at sea .
shortly before the planned operation could take place , consultations with the officer in command led to its cancellation .
before the gsg 9 could reach the scene , the kidnappers had brought the ship into port .
the situation became much more dangerous , as more pirates had gone aboard and the risk that police or hostages could be killed in an operation became too high .
the weekly magazine der spiegel tells the story somewhat differently .
the magazine says a gsg 9 dress rehearsal aboard the us helicopter ship " boxer " was a success , but at the last minute the us withdrew support for the operation .
der spiegel also blamed coordination difficulties between the operational commander and high command in berlin .
on top of that , they say there were conflicts between the gsg 9 and the bundeswehr .
the gsg 9 are better trained for hostage operations than the military 's special forces , but for the transport abroad they depended on the army .
schaeuble said the constitutional changes he has recommended are provided for under the coalition agreement between the christian democratic union and the social democratic party , but he criticized that the social democrats have so far blocked the changes . ch / ai , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following an aborted action by germany 's elite anti-terrorism police unit , the gsg 9 , to free a kidnapped freighter in somalia , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble wants to broaden the mandate of the bundeswehr . by a constitutional change the german military would be made responsible for an area which has until now been the province of the police .
" under the constitution , the gsg 9 is responsible for these kind of eventualities , but really , it should be the military 's duty .
for them to do this duty , though , we have to lay the legal foundations , and that means changing the constitution , " schaeuble said in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble , pushing for constitutional change the minister said it was decided to send the gsg 9 to africa because the bundeswehr alone could n't come up with the necessary resources to carry out a hostage liberation at sea .
shortly before the planned operation could take place , consultations with the officer in command led to its cancellation .
before the gsg 9 could reach the scene , the kidnappers had brought the ship into port .
the situation became much more dangerous , as more pirates had gone aboard and the risk that police or hostages could be killed in an operation became too high .
the weekly magazine der spiegel tells the story somewhat differently .
the magazine says a gsg 9 dress rehearsal aboard the us helicopter ship " boxer " was a success , but at the last minute the us withdrew support for the operation .
der spiegel also blamed coordination difficulties between the operational commander and high command in berlin .
on top of that , they say there were conflicts between the gsg 9 and the bundeswehr .
the gsg 9 are better trained for hostage operations than the military 's special forces , but for the transport abroad they depended on the army .
schaeuble said the constitutional changes he has recommended are provided for under the coalition agreement between the christian democratic union and the social democratic party , but he criticized that the social democrats have so far blocked the changes . ch / ai , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" basically if you did n't have oceans you would n't have a climate ... that sort of link and understanding is n't being talked about in climate change discussions , " jacqueline alder , head of the marine unit of the united nations environment program told news agency afp . the conference , which opened monday and lasts until friday , has drawn environmental experts , officials and ministers from 120 nations .
one of the main aims is to create a forum to coordinate international conservation efforts to counter the impact of rising sea levels and dwindling fish stocks blamed on higher temperatures . scientists warn of dramatic consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is tight for the conference in manado , sulawesi richard spinrad of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- said scientists are no longer ruling out a rise in sea levels by a whole meter in this century .
the world 's oceans absorb 22 million tons of carbon dioxide daily and acidity levels have risen by a third over the last 100 years , he added . scientists also say rising temperatures and over-fishing could lead to the collapse of key species that feed millions and help preserve vital ecosystems . " we 've calculated that if carbon emissions are n't cut , then in the long-term we 'll see the creation of large death zones in the seas at a depth of 200 and 800 meters which will hardly have any oxygen , " hans joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate change research told german newspaper die zeit recently . schellnhuber , who is chancellor angela merkel 's advisor on climate change , warned of dramatic consequences for fishing and world food supplies . indonesia pushes for special status for oceans indonesia , an archipelago nation of 17,000 islands , is pushing for recognition of the role of oceans in absorbing carbon dioxide which is blamed for global warming .
the government in jakarta has said it wants special status for oceans written into the successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . " it is clear that our precious marine resources are under dire and increasing threat and that in many parts of the world climate change will accelerate their destruction , " indonesian maritime affairs and fisheries minister freddy numberi said .
" adaptation and mitigation measures are urgently needed to be taken up not only to save marine and coastal resources but also to save the coastal communities . " saving coastal communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 150 million people in indonesia 's rely on the sea for their livelihood an estimated 150 people in the region are dependant on the ocean for their livelihood .
but pollution , tourism and illegal fishing have caused huge damage to indonesia 's marine ecosystems . " for the people here , the ocean provides everything they need to live - much more than in industrialized nations .
they 're totally dependant on the ocean 's resources , " tim jennerjahn , a biochemist at the leibnitz center for marine tropical ecology in bremen told german public broadcaster zdf . jennerjahn , who heads a joint german-indonesian project for the protection of indonesia 's coastline , said the aim was to create a sustainable coastal management system .
" that 's why it 's important that we present the project at the world ocean conference , " he said . meanwhile , leaders from six countries - east timor , indonesia , malaysia , papua new guinea , the philippines and the solomon islands - will meet on the margins of the conference to launch a plan to save the coral triangle , a vast underwater ecosystem that is home to more than half the world 's coral reefs . sp / sms , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" basically if you did n't have oceans you would n't have a climate ... that sort of link and understanding is n't being talked about in climate change discussions , " jacqueline alder , head of the marine unit of the united nations environment program told news agency afp . the conference , which opened monday and lasts until friday , has drawn environmental experts , officials and ministers from 120 nations .
one of the main aims is to create a forum to coordinate international conservation efforts to counter the impact of rising sea levels and dwindling fish stocks blamed on higher temperatures . scientists warn of dramatic consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is tight for the conference in manado , sulawesi richard spinrad of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- said scientists are no longer ruling out a rise in sea levels by a whole meter in this century .
the world 's oceans absorb 22 million tons of carbon dioxide daily and acidity levels have risen by a third over the last 100 years , he added . scientists also say rising temperatures and over-fishing could lead to the collapse of key species that feed millions and help preserve vital ecosystems . " we 've calculated that if carbon emissions are n't cut , then in the long-term we 'll see the creation of large death zones in the seas at a depth of 200 and 800 meters which will hardly have any oxygen , " hans joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate change research told german newspaper die zeit recently . schellnhuber , who is chancellor angela merkel 's advisor on climate change , warned of dramatic consequences for fishing and world food supplies . indonesia pushes for special status for oceans indonesia , an archipelago nation of 17,000 islands , is pushing for recognition of the role of oceans in absorbing carbon dioxide which is blamed for global warming .
the government in jakarta has said it wants special status for oceans written into the successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . " it is clear that our precious marine resources are under dire and increasing threat and that in many parts of the world climate change will accelerate their destruction , " indonesian maritime affairs and fisheries minister freddy numberi said .
" adaptation and mitigation measures are urgently needed to be taken up not only to save marine and coastal resources but also to save the coastal communities . " saving coastal communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 150 million people in indonesia 's rely on the sea for their livelihood an estimated 150 people in the region are dependant on the ocean for their livelihood .
but pollution , tourism and illegal fishing have caused huge damage to indonesia 's marine ecosystems . " for the people here , the ocean provides everything they need to live - much more than in industrialized nations .
they 're totally dependant on the ocean 's resources , " tim jennerjahn , a biochemist at the leibnitz center for marine tropical ecology in bremen told german public broadcaster zdf . jennerjahn , who heads a joint german-indonesian project for the protection of indonesia 's coastline , said the aim was to create a sustainable coastal management system .
" that 's why it 's important that we present the project at the world ocean conference , " he said . meanwhile , leaders from six countries - east timor , indonesia , malaysia , papua new guinea , the philippines and the solomon islands - will meet on the margins of the conference to launch a plan to save the coral triangle , a vast underwater ecosystem that is home to more than half the world 's coral reefs . sp / sms , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has used a speech to seek to heal the wounds created by , among other things , his reinstatement of a holocaust-denying bishop . the pope has begun his landmark , five-day trip to israel and the palestinian territories by condemning the holocaust and lingering anti-semitism , and calling for a " just and lasting solution " to the middle east conflict .
" tragically , the jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person , " he said at tel aviv 's ben-gurion airport .
he then went on to challenge israel 's conservative government by calling for the creation of a palestinian state .
" i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the six million jewish victims of the shoah , " the german-born pope said , using the hebrew term for the holocaust , " and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude . "
benedict , only the third reigning pope to visit the region , said : " i come , like so many others before me , to pray at the holy places , to pray especially for peace - peace in the holy land and peace throughout the world . "
pope deplores anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres , right , called the pope 's visit a " mission of peace " benedict recently angered many jews by lifting the excommunication on a holocaust-denying bishop .
he caused further anger by backing the beatification of controversial nazi-era pope pius xii .
" sadly , anti-semitism continues to raise its ugly head in parts of the world , " said the pontiff , calling this " totally unacceptable " and declaring " every effort " must be made to combat anti-semitism .
in the 45 years since the second vatican council repudiated the concept of collective jewish guilt for christ 's death , catholic-jewish relations have been haunted by the holocaust and the question of what the church did , or failed to do , about it .
they went through one of their worst periods after the pope in january lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops , including one who denied that six million jews were killed .
the vatican says it had not known enough about that british bishop 's past and the church and jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to yad vashem in jerusalem , israel 's memorial to the victims of the holocaust .
calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu , left , did not directly respond to the pope 's call for a palestinian state israeli president shimon peres , the country 's official head of state whose duties are largely ceremonial , welcomed pope benedict , calling his visit to the holy land a " mission of peace " and of " planting the seeds of tolerance and uprooting the weeds of fanaticism . "
the politically moderate peres also expressed hope for a lasting peace in the middle east .
" we 've made peace with egypt and jordan and we are negotiating peace with the palestinians .
we may also arrive at a comprehensive regional peace here in the near future .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a hardliner , who since taking office in late march following february 10 elections has refrained from openly committing to the establishment of a palestinian state , did not make a speech at the airport .
" it 's a pleasure to welcome you to the holy land , " he said as he shook benedict 's hand once the pontiff alighted from the royal jordanian aircraft , which had flown him from amman , jordan , where he had arrived on friday .
a " religious pilgrimage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope toured a mosque during a visit to jordan the catholic church has made a point of emphasizing that this is not a state visit by the head of the vatican , but a non-political , religious pilgrimage by its spiritual leader .
yet the visit is being seen as another milestone in israel-vatican relations , which have been historically tumultuous and were only formalized in 1993 .
the first reigning pope to visit was paul xi in 1964 , who made a one-day stopover from jordan , but refrained from mentioning israel by name , or meeting israeli leaders in jerusalem .
the second was john paul ii , who made a highly successful and emotional visit in 2000 .
after his stop at the airport , the pontiff later flew by israeli military helicopter to jerusalem .
the pope planned to visit the memorial of jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust remembrance institute .

the " iron men " - as they are popularly known - have gained notoriety over the past 11 months as their unique fans have been tranforming their old stadium into a modern soccer arena .
" this is the most unique experience of my career , " sylvia weisheit told dw radio .
weisheit , who has been a die-hard union berlin fan for the past three decades , is the manager of the stadium construction project .
" the fans spend their free time and holidays working at the constuction site .
they are totally committed to the community , and any company would be glad to have such workers . "
the middle-aged blonde is one of only about six to 10 professional builders at the site .
the rest of the 60 to 80 workers turning up each morning at 7 a.m. are union supporters .
iron men with an iron will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union fans toil for club glory since construction of the new stadium began last june , around 1,600 volunteers have put in an estimated 90,000 hours of work .
they have saved the club two million euros from the overall construction costs of 15 million euros .
the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- had threatend to close the club ’ s old forestry stadium , which dates back to the 1920s .
dfb offcials said it no longer met the security requirements of professional soccer in germany .
michael - or " kibi " as he likes to be known - said the dfb 's decision was a test of union supporters unique fan culture .
describing the club as a big family bound together by more than just football he said : " union is a social event .
we ’ ve got the spirit of a neighborhood club where everyone sticks together . "
the stadium construction project was proof , he said , that it is possible to combine " commercial soccer with preserving the club 's century-old tradition . "
iron men defy odds and oppression fc union berlin was founded in 1906 by metalworkers in the industrial district of koepenick in the east of the city .
union supporters ‘ rapturous chant " eisern union " - meaning " iron union " - first echoed through the old forestry stadium in the 1920s .
after world war two , berlin was divided and union berlin played in the leagues of the then communist east germany .
union berlin enjoyed cult status as the club of non-conformists and of all east berliners opposing the regime .
their eternal rivals in the city were bfc dynamo , a club run by the dreaded stasi secret police .
" they had a lot of money and they had the best players , " recalls thommy thiele , an union fan since he was 13 years old .
" we hated the bfc dynamo , we hated the secret service , we hated the berlin wall , we were in opposition to the state , " he told dw radio .
" that ’ s why in the 1980s there were over 20,000 people in the fc union stadium every match and only 5,000 people at bfc dynamo . "
after german unification in 1990 , fc union berlin experienced difficult economic times in professional soccer .
the club frequently hovered on the brink of insolvency .
there were fan protests at berlin ’ s brandenburg gate to force the city government to transform the stadium into club property .
in 2004 , union supporters donated blood to earn enough funds for the club to get dfb approval to play the next season .
new stadium ushers in new era those trying days have forged the club together , the fans say .
" the manager , the president , the coach , the team and the supporters make up a whole system , " says thommy thiele .
" dirk zingler , our president , was standing in the stadium behind me 20 years ago .
he is one of us , a part of the family . "
while the hard-working fans sweat it out on the stadium terraces , they can watch the players give their all on the training ground right next door .
to see the new oval rise from the rubble of the old stadium has been a huge boost for the team ’ s morale , said club coach uwe neuhaus .
" the team is well aware of the close bonds within the club .
this is something special and is currently being underscored by the fans very impressively . "
on saturday , coach neuhaus and the team paid back their debt to the fans by clinching promotion to the second division .
ironically , the victory came in the stadium of the hated bfc dynamo , where the team has played throughout the season .

but even if the club will have to struggle commercially , as well as on the pitch , the iron-willed union community can never be broken up .
" we have to maintain our spirit .
we have a lot of common people in our community and there is not a lot of money .
in the third division , the second division , the first division or the fourth division , i don ’ t care .
fc union is important , not the league we play in . "
the new old forestry stadium is to be officially be inaugurated on july 8 , 2008 with a friendly against berlin ’ s top club hertha bsc .

reports say more than 14 million euros were paid in a kickback scheme over several years . prosecutors in munich said they have reason to believe that the german truck maker had a system in place to " boost the sales of trucks and buses . "
that system allegedly included illegal payouts to man customers .
at times , bank accounts of relatives and friends were used to disguise the transactions , according to prosecutors .
between 2002 and 2005 , an estimated 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- in bribes are thought to have been paid out , the majority of it to customers outside of germany .
prosecutors did not specify exactly how many people were being investigated , but said the number is " well over 100 . "
that figure includes both man marketing staff and customers suspected of having taken illegal payoffs .
about 300 police personnel across germany are involved in the probe .
two people were arrested last week , although one was later released .
suspects could face charges for bribery and tax evasion .
corruption an issue in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is a leading german truck maker man , which has volkswagen as its dominant shareholder , said it was fully cooperating with the prosecutors .
prosecutors said the top management at man had not been implicated in the allegations , which arose after a tip-off from tax authorities .
the inquiry comes on the heels of a corruption scandal at engineering and telecommunications giant siemens in 2006 .
investigators found that siemens staff had set up slush funds to pay " commissions " to secure contracts .
the affair led to a major restructuring at siemens and the company later agreed to pay one billion euros in fines .
in 2007 , man responded to the siemens scandal by appointing two ombudsmen to accept tip-offs from whistle-blowers in the company and investigate possible breaches of corporate standards . th / pfd , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

much uncertainty remains , including who will own the auto giant and what city the company will call home . managers , lawyers and consultants from volkswagen and porsche began meetings on monday to discuss ways to bring the two german carmakers together into an integrated auto group , german press agency dpa reported , adding that it was still too early for talk among top executives . the two automakers have said they hope to be in a position to present a final merger plan by early-june , dpa reported .
many analysts have recently said negotiations will have to address a number of touchy subjects before a deal can be announced . " it 's not really clear how they will construct -lsb- the new company -rsb- , " juergen pieper from metzler bank told the afp news agency . contentious questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of both carmakers are wondering if factories will be shut or moved when company executives outlined merger plans on may 6 , they knew questions about where the resulting auto group would be based , who owns how much of the carmakers and who runs the company 's operations would be among the most contentious issues up for negotiation . " it is not a marriage made in heaven , but a marriage of convenience , " porsche boss wendelin wiedeking told the luxury sports carmaker 's workers may 7 . german media have reported that the new auto group is considering setting up its headquarters in either wolfsburg , where vw is currently based , or hannover , the capital of the state of lower saxony , which is a major volkswagen shareholder . porsche officials , however , said on monday that the location of the future carmaker 's headquarters remained uncertain .
porsche is based in the southern german city of stuttgart . even more important than where the offices are located is who will land in the vw-porsche driver 's seat .
in addition to vw chairman martin winterkorn and porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking , weekly news magazine focus reported the possibility that a " neutral " manager could take over . fresh start after long-running feud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche and volkswagen have been clashing for years audi boss rupert stadler is also being eyed for the top vw-porsche position , the magazine said , adding that he could represent a fresh start for porsche and volkswagen as a confidant of the porsche and piech families - who own porsche - and is also supported by lower saxony premier christian wulff , who control 's the state 's 20 percent stake in vw , and volkswagen 's ferdinand piech . the two carmakers have a long history of competition and strife due to personal and professional relationships among their founders , heads and supervisory board members .
porsche racked up some nine billion euros in debt trying to takeover vw , europe 's largest automaker and a company about 15 times larger than the luxury car firm . porsche spokesman albrecht bamler said company officials had not yet discussed who would head the company . the porsche and piech families would own between 45 percent and 55 percent of the merged company 's shares while lower saxony would have 21 percent to 25 percent , germany 's der spiegel magazine reported . plans to merge porsche and volkswagen into a single auto group would have to be approved by supervisory boards and shareholders at both companies .
if all involved agree to the deal , the resulting supervisory board would be responsible for naming the group 's boss . sms / pfd , ap / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reports say more than 14 million euros were paid in a kickback scheme over several years . prosecutors in munich said they have reason to believe that the german truck maker had a system in place to " boost the sales of trucks and buses . "
that system allegedly included illegal payouts to man customers .
at times , bank accounts of relatives and friends were used to disguise the transactions , according to prosecutors .
between 2002 and 2005 , an estimated 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- in bribes are thought to have been paid out , the majority of it to customers outside of germany .
prosecutors did not specify exactly how many people were being investigated , but said the number is " well over 100 . "
that figure includes both man marketing staff and customers suspected of having taken illegal payoffs .
about 300 police personnel across germany are involved in the probe .
two people were arrested last week , although one was later released .
suspects could face charges for bribery and tax evasion .
corruption an issue in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is a leading german truck maker man , which has volkswagen as its dominant shareholder , said it was fully cooperating with the prosecutors .
prosecutors said the top management at man had not been implicated in the allegations , which arose after a tip-off from tax authorities .
the inquiry comes on the heels of a corruption scandal at engineering and telecommunications giant siemens in 2006 .
investigators found that siemens staff had set up slush funds to pay " commissions " to secure contracts .
the affair led to a major restructuring at siemens and the company later agreed to pay one billion euros in fines .
in 2007 , man responded to the siemens scandal by appointing two ombudsmen to accept tip-offs from whistle-blowers in the company and investigate possible breaches of corporate standards . th / pfd , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has used a speech to seek to heal the wounds created by , among other things , his reinstatement of a holocaust-denying bishop . the pope has begun his landmark , five-day trip to israel and the palestinian territories by condemning the holocaust and lingering anti-semitism , and calling for a " just and lasting solution " to the middle east conflict .
" tragically , the jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person , " he said at tel aviv 's ben-gurion airport .
he then went on to challenge israel 's conservative government by calling for the creation of a palestinian state .
" i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the six million jewish victims of the shoah , " the german-born pope said , using the hebrew term for the holocaust , " and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude . "
benedict , only the third reigning pope to visit the region , said : " i come , like so many others before me , to pray at the holy places , to pray especially for peace - peace in the holy land and peace throughout the world . "
pope deplores anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres , right , called the pope 's visit a " mission of peace " benedict recently angered many jews by lifting the excommunication on a holocaust-denying bishop .
he caused further anger by backing the beatification of controversial nazi-era pope pius xii .
" sadly , anti-semitism continues to raise its ugly head in parts of the world , " said the pontiff , calling this " totally unacceptable " and declaring " every effort " must be made to combat anti-semitism .
in the 45 years since the second vatican council repudiated the concept of collective jewish guilt for christ 's death , catholic-jewish relations have been haunted by the holocaust and the question of what the church did , or failed to do , about it .
they went through one of their worst periods after the pope in january lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops , including one who denied that six million jews were killed .
the vatican says it had not known enough about that british bishop 's past and the church and jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to yad vashem in jerusalem , israel 's memorial to the victims of the holocaust .
calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu , left , did not directly respond to the pope 's call for a palestinian state israeli president shimon peres , the country 's official head of state whose duties are largely ceremonial , welcomed pope benedict , calling his visit to the holy land a " mission of peace " and of " planting the seeds of tolerance and uprooting the weeds of fanaticism . "
the politically moderate peres also expressed hope for a lasting peace in the middle east .
" we 've made peace with egypt and jordan and we are negotiating peace with the palestinians .
we may also arrive at a comprehensive regional peace here in the near future .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a hardliner , who since taking office in late march following february 10 elections has refrained from openly committing to the establishment of a palestinian state , did not make a speech at the airport .
" it 's a pleasure to welcome you to the holy land , " he said as he shook benedict 's hand once the pontiff alighted from the royal jordanian aircraft , which had flown him from amman , jordan , where he had arrived on friday .
a " religious pilgrimage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope toured a mosque during a visit to jordan the catholic church has made a point of emphasizing that this is not a state visit by the head of the vatican , but a non-political , religious pilgrimage by its spiritual leader .
yet the visit is being seen as another milestone in israel-vatican relations , which have been historically tumultuous and were only formalized in 1993 .
the first reigning pope to visit was paul xi in 1964 , who made a one-day stopover from jordan , but refrained from mentioning israel by name , or meeting israeli leaders in jerusalem .
the second was john paul ii , who made a highly successful and emotional visit in 2000 .
after his stop at the airport , the pontiff later flew by israeli military helicopter to jerusalem .
the pope planned to visit the memorial of jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust remembrance institute .
but he had no plans to visit the museum , which accuses pope pius xii of being silent in the face of the suffering of the jews . nt / pfd , reuters / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- had threatend to close the club ’ s old forestry stadium , which dates back to the 1920s .
dfb offcials said it no longer met the security requirements of professional soccer in germany .
michael - or " kibi " as he likes to be known - said the dfb 's decision was a test of union supporters unique fan culture .
describing the club as a big family bound together by more than just football he said : " union is a social event .
we ’ ve got the spirit of a neighborhood club where everyone sticks together . "
the stadium construction project was proof , he said , that it is possible to combine " commercial soccer with preserving the club 's century-old tradition . "
iron men defy odds and oppression fc union berlin was founded in 1906 by metalworkers in the industrial district of koepenick in the east of the city .
union supporters ‘ rapturous chant " eisern union " - meaning " iron union " - first echoed through the old forestry stadium in the 1920s .
after world war two , berlin was divided and union berlin played in the leagues of the then communist east germany .
union berlin enjoyed cult status as the club of non-conformists and of all east berliners opposing the regime .
their eternal rivals in the city were bfc dynamo , a club run by the dreaded stasi secret police .
" they had a lot of money and they had the best players , " recalls thommy thiele , an union fan since he was 13 years old .
" we hated the bfc dynamo , we hated the secret service , we hated the berlin wall , we were in opposition to the state , " he told dw radio .
" that ’ s why in the 1980s there were over 20,000 people in the fc union stadium every match and only 5,000 people at bfc dynamo . "
after german unification in 1990 , fc union berlin experienced difficult economic times in professional soccer .
the club frequently hovered on the brink of insolvency .
there were fan protests at berlin ’ s brandenburg gate to force the city government to transform the stadium into club property .
in 2004 , union supporters donated blood to earn enough funds for the club to get dfb approval to play the next season .
new stadium ushers in new era those trying days have forged the club together , the fans say .

he is one of us , a part of the family . "
while the hard-working fans sweat it out on the stadium terraces , they can watch the players give their all on the training ground right next door .
to see the new oval rise from the rubble of the old stadium has been a huge boost for the team ’ s morale , said club coach uwe neuhaus .
" the team is well aware of the close bonds within the club .
this is something special and is currently being underscored by the fans very impressively . "

" basically if you did n't have oceans you would n't have a climate ... that sort of link and understanding is n't being talked about in climate change discussions , " jacqueline alder , head of the marine unit of the united nations environment program told news agency afp . the conference , which opened monday and lasts until friday , has drawn environmental experts , officials and ministers from 120 nations .
one of the main aims is to create a forum to coordinate international conservation efforts to counter the impact of rising sea levels and dwindling fish stocks blamed on higher temperatures . scientists warn of dramatic consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is tight for the conference in manado , sulawesi richard spinrad of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- said scientists are no longer ruling out a rise in sea levels by a whole meter in this century .
the world 's oceans absorb 22 million tons of carbon dioxide daily and acidity levels have risen by a third over the last 100 years , he added . scientists also say rising temperatures and over-fishing could lead to the collapse of key species that feed millions and help preserve vital ecosystems . " we 've calculated that if carbon emissions are n't cut , then in the long-term we 'll see the creation of large death zones in the seas at a depth of 200 and 800 meters which will hardly have any oxygen , " hans joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate change research told german newspaper die zeit recently . schellnhuber , who is chancellor angela merkel 's advisor on climate change , warned of dramatic consequences for fishing and world food supplies . indonesia pushes for special status for oceans indonesia , an archipelago nation of 17,000 islands , is pushing for recognition of the role of oceans in absorbing carbon dioxide which is blamed for global warming .
the government in jakarta has said it wants special status for oceans written into the successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . " it is clear that our precious marine resources are under dire and increasing threat and that in many parts of the world climate change will accelerate their destruction , " indonesian maritime affairs and fisheries minister freddy numberi said .
" adaptation and mitigation measures are urgently needed to be taken up not only to save marine and coastal resources but also to save the coastal communities .

they 're totally dependant on the ocean 's resources , " tim jennerjahn , a biochemist at the leibnitz center for marine tropical ecology in bremen told german public broadcaster zdf . jennerjahn , who heads a joint german-indonesian project for the protection of indonesia 's coastline , said the aim was to create a sustainable coastal management system .
" that 's why it 's important that we present the project at the world ocean conference , " he said . meanwhile , leaders from six countries - east timor , indonesia , malaysia , papua new guinea , the philippines and the solomon islands - will meet on the margins of the conference to launch a plan to save the coral triangle , a vast underwater ecosystem that is home to more than half the world 's coral reefs . sp / sms , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 've calculated that if carbon emissions are n't cut , then in the long-term we 'll see the creation of large death zones in the seas at a depth of 200 and 800 meters which will hardly have any oxygen , " hans joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate change research told german newspaper die zeit recently . schellnhuber , who is chancellor angela merkel 's advisor on climate change , warned of dramatic consequences for fishing and world food supplies . indonesia pushes for special status for oceans indonesia , an archipelago nation of 17,000 islands , is pushing for recognition of the role of oceans in absorbing carbon dioxide which is blamed for global warming .
the government in jakarta has said it wants special status for oceans written into the successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . " it is clear that our precious marine resources are under dire and increasing threat and that in many parts of the world climate change will accelerate their destruction , " indonesian maritime affairs and fisheries minister freddy numberi said .
" adaptation and mitigation measures are urgently needed to be taken up not only to save marine and coastal resources but also to save the coastal communities . " saving coastal communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 150 million people in indonesia 's rely on the sea for their livelihood an estimated 150 people in the region are dependant on the ocean for their livelihood .
but pollution , tourism and illegal fishing have caused huge damage to indonesia 's marine ecosystems . " for the people here , the ocean provides everything they need to live - much more than in industrialized nations .
they 're totally dependant on the ocean 's resources , " tim jennerjahn , a biochemist at the leibnitz center for marine tropical ecology in bremen told german public broadcaster zdf . jennerjahn , who heads a joint german-indonesian project for the protection of indonesia 's coastline , said the aim was to create a sustainable coastal management system .
" that 's why it 's important that we present the project at the world ocean conference , " he said . meanwhile , leaders from six countries - east timor , indonesia , malaysia , papua new guinea , the philippines and the solomon islands - will meet on the margins of the conference to launch a plan to save the coral triangle , a vast underwater ecosystem that is home to more than half the world 's coral reefs . sp / sms , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " iron men " - as they are popularly known - have gained notoriety over the past 11 months as their unique fans have been tranforming their old stadium into a modern soccer arena .
" this is the most unique experience of my career , " sylvia weisheit told dw radio .
weisheit , who has been a die-hard union berlin fan for the past three decades , is the manager of the stadium construction project .
" the fans spend their free time and holidays working at the constuction site .
they are totally committed to the community , and any company would be glad to have such workers . "
the middle-aged blonde is one of only about six to 10 professional builders at the site .
the rest of the 60 to 80 workers turning up each morning at 7 a.m. are union supporters .
iron men with an iron will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union fans toil for club glory since construction of the new stadium began last june , around 1,600 volunteers have put in an estimated 90,000 hours of work .
they have saved the club two million euros from the overall construction costs of 15 million euros .
the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- had threatend to close the club ’ s old forestry stadium , which dates back to the 1920s .
dfb offcials said it no longer met the security requirements of professional soccer in germany .
michael - or " kibi " as he likes to be known - said the dfb 's decision was a test of union supporters unique fan culture .
describing the club as a big family bound together by more than just football he said : " union is a social event .
we ’ ve got the spirit of a neighborhood club where everyone sticks together . "
the stadium construction project was proof , he said , that it is possible to combine " commercial soccer with preserving the club 's century-old tradition . "
iron men defy odds and oppression fc union berlin was founded in 1906 by metalworkers in the industrial district of koepenick in the east of the city .
union supporters ‘ rapturous chant " eisern union " - meaning " iron union " - first echoed through the old forestry stadium in the 1920s .
after world war two , berlin was divided and union berlin played in the leagues of the then communist east germany .
union berlin enjoyed cult status as the club of non-conformists and of all east berliners opposing the regime .
their eternal rivals in the city were bfc dynamo , a club run by the dreaded stasi secret police .
" they had a lot of money and they had the best players , " recalls thommy thiele , an union fan since he was 13 years old .
" we hated the bfc dynamo , we hated the secret service , we hated the berlin wall , we were in opposition to the state , " he told dw radio .
" that ’ s why in the 1980s there were over 20,000 people in the fc union stadium every match and only 5,000 people at bfc dynamo . "
after german unification in 1990 , fc union berlin experienced difficult economic times in professional soccer .
the club frequently hovered on the brink of insolvency .
there were fan protests at berlin ’ s brandenburg gate to force the city government to transform the stadium into club property .
in 2004 , union supporters donated blood to earn enough funds for the club to get dfb approval to play the next season .
new stadium ushers in new era those trying days have forged the club together , the fans say .
" the manager , the president , the coach , the team and the supporters make up a whole system , " says thommy thiele .
" dirk zingler , our president , was standing in the stadium behind me 20 years ago .
he is one of us , a part of the family . "
while the hard-working fans sweat it out on the stadium terraces , they can watch the players give their all on the training ground right next door .
to see the new oval rise from the rubble of the old stadium has been a huge boost for the team ’ s morale , said club coach uwe neuhaus .
" the team is well aware of the close bonds within the club .
this is something special and is currently being underscored by the fans very impressively . "
on saturday , coach neuhaus and the team paid back their debt to the fans by clinching promotion to the second division .
ironically , the victory came in the stadium of the hated bfc dynamo , where the team has played throughout the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union player macchambes younga-mouhani -lrb- 2.v.r -rrb- scores opening goal against jahn regensburg promotion to the second bundesliga ushers in new challenges for union berlin , said thommy thiele .
but even if the club will have to struggle commercially , as well as on the pitch , the iron-willed union community can never be broken up .
" we have to maintain our spirit .
we have a lot of common people in our community and there is not a lot of money .
in the third division , the second division , the first division or the fourth division , i don ’ t care .
fc union is important , not the league we play in . "
the new old forestry stadium is to be officially be inaugurated on july 8 , 2008 with a friendly against berlin ’ s top club hertha bsc .

he has used a speech to seek to heal the wounds created by , among other things , his reinstatement of a holocaust-denying bishop . the pope has begun his landmark , five-day trip to israel and the palestinian territories by condemning the holocaust and lingering anti-semitism , and calling for a " just and lasting solution " to the middle east conflict .
" tragically , the jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person , " he said at tel aviv 's ben-gurion airport .
he then went on to challenge israel 's conservative government by calling for the creation of a palestinian state .
" i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the six million jewish victims of the shoah , " the german-born pope said , using the hebrew term for the holocaust , " and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude . "
benedict , only the third reigning pope to visit the region , said : " i come , like so many others before me , to pray at the holy places , to pray especially for peace - peace in the holy land and peace throughout the world . "

they went through one of their worst periods after the pope in january lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops , including one who denied that six million jews were killed .
the vatican says it had not known enough about that british bishop 's past and the church and jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to yad vashem in jerusalem , israel 's memorial to the victims of the holocaust .

prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a hardliner , who since taking office in late march following february 10 elections has refrained from openly committing to the establishment of a palestinian state , did not make a speech at the airport .

reports say more than 14 million euros were paid in a kickback scheme over several years . prosecutors in munich said they have reason to believe that the german truck maker had a system in place to " boost the sales of trucks and buses . "
that system allegedly included illegal payouts to man customers .
at times , bank accounts of relatives and friends were used to disguise the transactions , according to prosecutors .
between 2002 and 2005 , an estimated 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- in bribes are thought to have been paid out , the majority of it to customers outside of germany .
prosecutors did not specify exactly how many people were being investigated , but said the number is " well over 100 . "
that figure includes both man marketing staff and customers suspected of having taken illegal payoffs .
about 300 police personnel across germany are involved in the probe .
two people were arrested last week , although one was later released .
suspects could face charges for bribery and tax evasion .

prosecutors said the top management at man had not been implicated in the allegations , which arose after a tip-off from tax authorities .
the inquiry comes on the heels of a corruption scandal at engineering and telecommunications giant siemens in 2006 .
investigators found that siemens staff had set up slush funds to pay " commissions " to secure contracts .
the affair led to a major restructuring at siemens and the company later agreed to pay one billion euros in fines .
in 2007 , man responded to the siemens scandal by appointing two ombudsmen to accept tip-offs from whistle-blowers in the company and investigate possible breaches of corporate standards . th / pfd , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has used a speech to seek to heal the wounds created by , among other things , his reinstatement of a holocaust-denying bishop . the pope has begun his landmark , five-day trip to israel and the palestinian territories by condemning the holocaust and lingering anti-semitism , and calling for a " just and lasting solution " to the middle east conflict .
" tragically , the jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person , " he said at tel aviv 's ben-gurion airport .
he then went on to challenge israel 's conservative government by calling for the creation of a palestinian state .
" i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the six million jewish victims of the shoah , " the german-born pope said , using the hebrew term for the holocaust , " and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude . "
benedict , only the third reigning pope to visit the region , said : " i come , like so many others before me , to pray at the holy places , to pray especially for peace - peace in the holy land and peace throughout the world . "
pope deplores anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres , right , called the pope 's visit a " mission of peace " benedict recently angered many jews by lifting the excommunication on a holocaust-denying bishop .
he caused further anger by backing the beatification of controversial nazi-era pope pius xii .
" sadly , anti-semitism continues to raise its ugly head in parts of the world , " said the pontiff , calling this " totally unacceptable " and declaring " every effort " must be made to combat anti-semitism .
in the 45 years since the second vatican council repudiated the concept of collective jewish guilt for christ 's death , catholic-jewish relations have been haunted by the holocaust and the question of what the church did , or failed to do , about it .
they went through one of their worst periods after the pope in january lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops , including one who denied that six million jews were killed .
the vatican says it had not known enough about that british bishop 's past and the church and jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to yad vashem in jerusalem , israel 's memorial to the victims of the holocaust .
calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu , left , did not directly respond to the pope 's call for a palestinian state israeli president shimon peres , the country 's official head of state whose duties are largely ceremonial , welcomed pope benedict , calling his visit to the holy land a " mission of peace " and of " planting the seeds of tolerance and uprooting the weeds of fanaticism . "
the politically moderate peres also expressed hope for a lasting peace in the middle east .
" we 've made peace with egypt and jordan and we are negotiating peace with the palestinians .
we may also arrive at a comprehensive regional peace here in the near future .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a hardliner , who since taking office in late march following february 10 elections has refrained from openly committing to the establishment of a palestinian state , did not make a speech at the airport .
" it 's a pleasure to welcome you to the holy land , " he said as he shook benedict 's hand once the pontiff alighted from the royal jordanian aircraft , which had flown him from amman , jordan , where he had arrived on friday .
a " religious pilgrimage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope toured a mosque during a visit to jordan the catholic church has made a point of emphasizing that this is not a state visit by the head of the vatican , but a non-political , religious pilgrimage by its spiritual leader .
yet the visit is being seen as another milestone in israel-vatican relations , which have been historically tumultuous and were only formalized in 1993 .
the first reigning pope to visit was paul xi in 1964 , who made a one-day stopover from jordan , but refrained from mentioning israel by name , or meeting israeli leaders in jerusalem .
the second was john paul ii , who made a highly successful and emotional visit in 2000 .
after his stop at the airport , the pontiff later flew by israeli military helicopter to jerusalem .
the pope planned to visit the memorial of jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust remembrance institute .
but he had no plans to visit the museum , which accuses pope pius xii of being silent in the face of the suffering of the jews . nt / pfd , reuters / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reports say more than 14 million euros were paid in a kickback scheme over several years . prosecutors in munich said they have reason to believe that the german truck maker had a system in place to " boost the sales of trucks and buses . "
that system allegedly included illegal payouts to man customers .
at times , bank accounts of relatives and friends were used to disguise the transactions , according to prosecutors .
between 2002 and 2005 , an estimated 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- in bribes are thought to have been paid out , the majority of it to customers outside of germany .
prosecutors did not specify exactly how many people were being investigated , but said the number is " well over 100 . "
that figure includes both man marketing staff and customers suspected of having taken illegal payoffs .
about 300 police personnel across germany are involved in the probe .
two people were arrested last week , although one was later released .
suspects could face charges for bribery and tax evasion .
corruption an issue in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is a leading german truck maker man , which has volkswagen as its dominant shareholder , said it was fully cooperating with the prosecutors .
prosecutors said the top management at man had not been implicated in the allegations , which arose after a tip-off from tax authorities .
the inquiry comes on the heels of a corruption scandal at engineering and telecommunications giant siemens in 2006 .
investigators found that siemens staff had set up slush funds to pay " commissions " to secure contracts .
the affair led to a major restructuring at siemens and the company later agreed to pay one billion euros in fines .
in 2007 , man responded to the siemens scandal by appointing two ombudsmen to accept tip-offs from whistle-blowers in the company and investigate possible breaches of corporate standards . th / pfd , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet the visit is being seen as another milestone in israel-vatican relations , which have been historically tumultuous and were only formalized in 1993 .
the first reigning pope to visit was paul xi in 1964 , who made a one-day stopover from jordan , but refrained from mentioning israel by name , or meeting israeli leaders in jerusalem .
the second was john paul ii , who made a highly successful and emotional visit in 2000 .
after his stop at the airport , the pontiff later flew by israeli military helicopter to jerusalem .
the pope planned to visit the memorial of jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust remembrance institute .
but he had no plans to visit the museum , which accuses pope pius xii of being silent in the face of the suffering of the jews . nt / pfd , reuters / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steel workers snaked through the city of duisburg in a convoy of about 300 cars , 1,500 workers protested at the nordseewerke wharf in emden , and about 1,000 demonstrators participated in the protest at hdw shipbuilders in kiel .
about 3,000 workers held a vigil at the company 's steel works in bochum .

“ i expect essential agreement concerning our key demands so that we can reach a basis for negotiations , ” schlenz told germany 's dpa news agency .
employees are demanding job security and the continuation of workers ' participation in decision-making .

the federal statistics office in wiesbaden announced on monday that production in the steel industry is down by more than 50 percent .
german smelting works produced 1,06 million tons of iron ore and 1,88 million tons of crude steel last month - a staggering 56,8 percent less iron ore and 53,1 percent less crude steel than in the same period in 2008 .
the german steel federation does not expect the situation to improve any time soon .
“ we expect a decline of more than 25 percent for 2009 , “ a spokeswoman said .
grim outlook for the steel-using industries demand for steel and other construction materials has fallen off precipitously since the downturn began at the end of last year .
nationwide , iron ore is only being produced at nine of the 15 german blast furnaces – and they have been operating at a mere 50 percent of their capacity . as a result , 45,000 of the 94,000 people employed by germany 's steel industry are currently working reduced hours . db / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

much uncertainty remains , including who will own the auto giant and what city the company will call home . managers , lawyers and consultants from volkswagen and porsche began meetings on monday to discuss ways to bring the two german carmakers together into an integrated auto group , german press agency dpa reported , adding that it was still too early for talk among top executives . the two automakers have said they hope to be in a position to present a final merger plan by early-june , dpa reported .
many analysts have recently said negotiations will have to address a number of touchy subjects before a deal can be announced . " it 's not really clear how they will construct -lsb- the new company -rsb- , " juergen pieper from metzler bank told the afp news agency . contentious questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of both carmakers are wondering if factories will be shut or moved when company executives outlined merger plans on may 6 , they knew questions about where the resulting auto group would be based , who owns how much of the carmakers and who runs the company 's operations would be among the most contentious issues up for negotiation . " it is not a marriage made in heaven , but a marriage of convenience , " porsche boss wendelin wiedeking told the luxury sports carmaker 's workers may 7 . german media have reported that the new auto group is considering setting up its headquarters in either wolfsburg , where vw is currently based , or hannover , the capital of the state of lower saxony , which is a major volkswagen shareholder . porsche officials , however , said on monday that the location of the future carmaker 's headquarters remained uncertain .
porsche is based in the southern german city of stuttgart . even more important than where the offices are located is who will land in the vw-porsche driver 's seat .
in addition to vw chairman martin winterkorn and porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking , weekly news magazine focus reported the possibility that a " neutral " manager could take over . fresh start after long-running feud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche and volkswagen have been clashing for years audi boss rupert stadler is also being eyed for the top vw-porsche position , the magazine said , adding that he could represent a fresh start for porsche and volkswagen as a confidant of the porsche and piech families - who own porsche - and is also supported by lower saxony premier christian wulff , who control 's the state 's 20 percent stake in vw , and volkswagen 's ferdinand piech . the two carmakers have a long history of competition and strife due to personal and professional relationships among their founders , heads and supervisory board members .
porsche racked up some nine billion euros in debt trying to takeover vw , europe 's largest automaker and a company about 15 times larger than the luxury car firm . porsche spokesman albrecht bamler said company officials had not yet discussed who would head the company . the porsche and piech families would own between 45 percent and 55 percent of the merged company 's shares while lower saxony would have 21 percent to 25 percent , germany 's der spiegel magazine reported . plans to merge porsche and volkswagen into a single auto group would have to be approved by supervisory boards and shareholders at both companies .

reports say more than 14 million euros were paid in a kickback scheme over several years . prosecutors in munich said they have reason to believe that the german truck maker had a system in place to " boost the sales of trucks and buses . "
that system allegedly included illegal payouts to man customers .

between 2002 and 2005 , an estimated 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- in bribes are thought to have been paid out , the majority of it to customers outside of germany .
prosecutors did not specify exactly how many people were being investigated , but said the number is " well over 100 . "

the inquiry comes on the heels of a corruption scandal at engineering and telecommunications giant siemens in 2006 .

the affair led to a major restructuring at siemens and the company later agreed to pay one billion euros in fines .

the world 's oceans absorb 22 million tons of carbon dioxide daily and acidity levels have risen by a third over the last 100 years , he added . scientists also say rising temperatures and over-fishing could lead to the collapse of key species that feed millions and help preserve vital ecosystems . " we 've calculated that if carbon emissions are n't cut , then in the long-term we 'll see the creation of large death zones in the seas at a depth of 200 and 800 meters which will hardly have any oxygen , " hans joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate change research told german newspaper die zeit recently . schellnhuber , who is chancellor angela merkel 's advisor on climate change , warned of dramatic consequences for fishing and world food supplies . indonesia pushes for special status for oceans indonesia , an archipelago nation of 17,000 islands , is pushing for recognition of the role of oceans in absorbing carbon dioxide which is blamed for global warming .
the government in jakarta has said it wants special status for oceans written into the successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . " it is clear that our precious marine resources are under dire and increasing threat and that in many parts of the world climate change will accelerate their destruction , " indonesian maritime affairs and fisheries minister freddy numberi said .
" adaptation and mitigation measures are urgently needed to be taken up not only to save marine and coastal resources but also to save the coastal communities . " saving coastal communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 150 million people in indonesia 's rely on the sea for their livelihood an estimated 150 people in the region are dependant on the ocean for their livelihood .
but pollution , tourism and illegal fishing have caused huge damage to indonesia 's marine ecosystems . " for the people here , the ocean provides everything they need to live - much more than in industrialized nations .
they 're totally dependant on the ocean 's resources , " tim jennerjahn , a biochemist at the leibnitz center for marine tropical ecology in bremen told german public broadcaster zdf . jennerjahn , who heads a joint german-indonesian project for the protection of indonesia 's coastline , said the aim was to create a sustainable coastal management system .
" that 's why it 's important that we present the project at the world ocean conference , " he said . meanwhile , leaders from six countries - east timor , indonesia , malaysia , papua new guinea , the philippines and the solomon islands - will meet on the margins of the conference to launch a plan to save the coral triangle , a vast underwater ecosystem that is home to more than half the world 's coral reefs . sp / sms , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de israel -pipe- 11.05.2009 pope benedict begins israel visit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope arrives in israel after three days in jordan pope benedict xvi enters the most sensitive leg of his middle east tour as he visits israel and the palestinian territories . in israel the german-born pontiff will be seeking to continue to repair relations , after he angered many jews earlier this year by lifting the excommunication of a holocaust-denying british bishop .
the vatican says it did not know enough about the bishop 's past and both sides now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit to jerusalem 's yad vashem memorial to holocaust victims .
most jewish leaders now consider the episode to have been put to rest - but not all .
the dorot hemeshech association of holocaust survivors has called on drivers to blow their car horns during the pope 's speech at yad vashem .
" israelis will this way express their disapproval of the pope who encourages holocaust denial and anti-semitism , " the association said .
the german-born pontiff 's membership in the hitler youth , although it was forced , has also angered holocaust survivors .
in addition , a group of far-right activists has said they plan to press criminal charges against the pope over vatican treasures they claim were plundered from jewish people , while nitzan horowitz , a gay rights activist and a left-wing parliamentarian , will boycott all official ceremonies held for the pope .
" pope benedict xvi is responsible for the suffering of thousands of people in the world , " horowitz said .
" he conveys a message of extremism and insensitivity , " he added , referring to a papal warning that condom use could be aggravating africa 's aids crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pm netanyahu has not yet endorsed the idea of a palestinian state pope to meet israeli and palestinian leaders during his five-day visit , pope benedict will hold talks with israeli and palestinian leaders .
he is expected to repeat his offer for the catholic church to do all it can to help the stalled peace process .
the vatican supports a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which also has internationally backing .
pope benedict will be welcomed by israeli president shimon peres and the country 's new , right-leaning prime minister , benjamin netanyahu .
since being sworn in to power at the end of march , netanyahu has so far refused to publicly endorse the creation of a palestinian state .
he did , however , say on sunday that israel will try to ease restrictions on palestinians in the west bank .
" i think we need to make a big effort , within the given security constraints , to make things easier for the palestinians , " netanyahu reportedly told ministers during a cabinet meeting .
after welcoming the pope , prime minister netanyahu heads to egypt , on his first trip to the arab world since he took office .
egypt is looking for netanyahu to support and endorse palestinian independence .
meanwhile , the united nations security council is holding talks on monday , to also revive the stalled middle east peace process . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin , who chairs the 15-member security council this month , called the meeting to stress the " urgency of reaching comprehensive peace in the middle east .

following an aborted action by germany 's elite anti-terrorism police unit , the gsg 9 , to free a kidnapped freighter in somalia , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble wants to broaden the mandate of the bundeswehr . by a constitutional change the german military would be made responsible for an area which has until now been the province of the police .
" under the constitution , the gsg 9 is responsible for these kind of eventualities , but really , it should be the military 's duty .
for them to do this duty , though , we have to lay the legal foundations , and that means changing the constitution , " schaeuble said in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble , pushing for constitutional change the minister said it was decided to send the gsg 9 to africa because the bundeswehr alone could n't come up with the necessary resources to carry out a hostage liberation at sea .
shortly before the planned operation could take place , consultations with the officer in command led to its cancellation .
before the gsg 9 could reach the scene , the kidnappers had brought the ship into port .
the situation became much more dangerous , as more pirates had gone aboard and the risk that police or hostages could be killed in an operation became too high .
the weekly magazine der spiegel tells the story somewhat differently .
the magazine says a gsg 9 dress rehearsal aboard the us helicopter ship " boxer " was a success , but at the last minute the us withdrew support for the operation .
der spiegel also blamed coordination difficulties between the operational commander and high command in berlin .
on top of that , they say there were conflicts between the gsg 9 and the bundeswehr .
the gsg 9 are better trained for hostage operations than the military 's special forces , but for the transport abroad they depended on the army .
schaeuble said the constitutional changes he has recommended are provided for under the coalition agreement between the christian democratic union and the social democratic party , but he criticized that the social democrats have so far blocked the changes . ch / ai , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says the drug 's efficacy has so far only been proven in lab tests . countries have to be provided with data on whether the drug tamiflu is effective in fighting swine flu in humans before millions are spent stockpiling the anti-viral drug , according to bernd muehlbauer , the head of the institute for pharmacology at the bremen-mitte clinic . " we absolutely do not know whether it helps with swine flu , " muehlbauer said in an interview with german news magazine der spiegel .
" the efficacy has only been shown in the lab .
one should first prove that this medication actually works against this new kind of pathogen before one damages the economy by shelling out millions on tamiflu . " muehlbauer said tamiflu 's effectiveness in fighting the normal flu had also been widely overstated , pointing out that on average the anti-viral drug reduced the length of the illness by just one day . the expert also criticized a recent move by british authorities to administer tamiflu to an entire school after it was discovered that five students were infected with the h1n1 virus . " excessive and irresponsible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airport authorities around the world are closely monitoring flights arriving from mexico " that is not just excessive but also practically irresponsible , " muehlbauer told the magazine .
" for one , such a thing can lead to the development of resistance . " muehlbauer also criticized emergency plans by the german government to store stocks of tamiflu to treat 20 percent of the population in case of a pandemic .
germany has so far reported 11 confirmed cases of the virus . muelhbauer 's views are at odds with the prevailing wisdom on treating the swine flu virus that scientists say is a genetic mixture of swine , bird and human viruses that first emerged in mexico in late april . who pushes nations to stockpile tamiflu both the world health organization and the eu 's european medicines agency -lrb- ema -rrb- have recommended countries to stockpile tamiflu , known generically as oseltamivir , as confirmed cases of swine flu infections continue to climb around the world . in its latest global tally , the who confirmed 4,379 infections with the new type a strain of h1n1 flu in some 29 countries .

tui brought in 990 million euros in the quarter from the sale of a stake of its hapag-lloyd marine division to a consortium of investors , including the city of hamburg .
for 2009 as a whole , the company predicted sales would keep falling .

the vatican says it did not know enough about the bishop 's past and both sides now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit to jerusalem 's yad vashem memorial to holocaust victims .
most jewish leaders now consider the episode to have been put to rest - but not all .
the dorot hemeshech association of holocaust survivors has called on drivers to blow their car horns during the pope 's speech at yad vashem .
" israelis will this way express their disapproval of the pope who encourages holocaust denial and anti-semitism , " the association said .
the german-born pontiff 's membership in the hitler youth , although it was forced , has also angered holocaust survivors .
in addition , a group of far-right activists has said they plan to press criminal charges against the pope over vatican treasures they claim were plundered from jewish people , while nitzan horowitz , a gay rights activist and a left-wing parliamentarian , will boycott all official ceremonies held for the pope .
" pope benedict xvi is responsible for the suffering of thousands of people in the world , " horowitz said .
" he conveys a message of extremism and insensitivity , " he added , referring to a papal warning that condom use could be aggravating africa 's aids crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pm netanyahu has not yet endorsed the idea of a palestinian state pope to meet israeli and palestinian leaders during his five-day visit , pope benedict will hold talks with israeli and palestinian leaders .
he is expected to repeat his offer for the catholic church to do all it can to help the stalled peace process .
the vatican supports a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which also has internationally backing .
pope benedict will be welcomed by israeli president shimon peres and the country 's new , right-leaning prime minister , benjamin netanyahu .
since being sworn in to power at the end of march , netanyahu has so far refused to publicly endorse the creation of a palestinian state .
he did , however , say on sunday that israel will try to ease restrictions on palestinians in the west bank .
" i think we need to make a big effort , within the given security constraints , to make things easier for the palestinians , " netanyahu reportedly told ministers during a cabinet meeting .
after welcoming the pope , prime minister netanyahu heads to egypt , on his first trip to the arab world since he took office .
egypt is looking for netanyahu to support and endorse palestinian independence .
meanwhile , the united nations security council is holding talks on monday , to also revive the stalled middle east peace process . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin , who chairs the 15-member security council this month , called the meeting to stress the " urgency of reaching comprehensive peace in the middle east .

following an aborted action by germany 's elite anti-terrorism police unit , the gsg 9 , to free a kidnapped freighter in somalia , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble wants to broaden the mandate of the bundeswehr . by a constitutional change the german military would be made responsible for an area which has until now been the province of the police .
" under the constitution , the gsg 9 is responsible for these kind of eventualities , but really , it should be the military 's duty .
for them to do this duty , though , we have to lay the legal foundations , and that means changing the constitution , " schaeuble said in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble , pushing for constitutional change the minister said it was decided to send the gsg 9 to africa because the bundeswehr alone could n't come up with the necessary resources to carry out a hostage liberation at sea .
shortly before the planned operation could take place , consultations with the officer in command led to its cancellation .
before the gsg 9 could reach the scene , the kidnappers had brought the ship into port .
the situation became much more dangerous , as more pirates had gone aboard and the risk that police or hostages could be killed in an operation became too high .
the weekly magazine der spiegel tells the story somewhat differently .
the magazine says a gsg 9 dress rehearsal aboard the us helicopter ship " boxer " was a success , but at the last minute the us withdrew support for the operation .
der spiegel also blamed coordination difficulties between the operational commander and high command in berlin .
on top of that , they say there were conflicts between the gsg 9 and the bundeswehr .
the gsg 9 are better trained for hostage operations than the military 's special forces , but for the transport abroad they depended on the army .

the vatican says it did not know enough about the bishop 's past and both sides now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit to jerusalem 's yad vashem memorial to holocaust victims .
most jewish leaders now consider the episode to have been put to rest - but not all .
the dorot hemeshech association of holocaust survivors has called on drivers to blow their car horns during the pope 's speech at yad vashem .
" israelis will this way express their disapproval of the pope who encourages holocaust denial and anti-semitism , " the association said .
the german-born pontiff 's membership in the hitler youth , although it was forced , has also angered holocaust survivors .
in addition , a group of far-right activists has said they plan to press criminal charges against the pope over vatican treasures they claim were plundered from jewish people , while nitzan horowitz , a gay rights activist and a left-wing parliamentarian , will boycott all official ceremonies held for the pope .

the " iron men " - as they are popularly known - have gained notoriety over the past 11 months as their unique fans have been tranforming their old stadium into a modern soccer arena .
" this is the most unique experience of my career , " sylvia weisheit told dw radio .
weisheit , who has been a die-hard union berlin fan for the past three decades , is the manager of the stadium construction project .
" the fans spend their free time and holidays working at the constuction site .
they are totally committed to the community , and any company would be glad to have such workers . "
the middle-aged blonde is one of only about six to 10 professional builders at the site .
the rest of the 60 to 80 workers turning up each morning at 7 a.m. are union supporters .
iron men with an iron will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union fans toil for club glory since construction of the new stadium began last june , around 1,600 volunteers have put in an estimated 90,000 hours of work .
they have saved the club two million euros from the overall construction costs of 15 million euros .
the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- had threatend to close the club ’ s old forestry stadium , which dates back to the 1920s .
dfb offcials said it no longer met the security requirements of professional soccer in germany .
michael - or " kibi " as he likes to be known - said the dfb 's decision was a test of union supporters unique fan culture .
describing the club as a big family bound together by more than just football he said : " union is a social event .
we ’ ve got the spirit of a neighborhood club where everyone sticks together . "
the stadium construction project was proof , he said , that it is possible to combine " commercial soccer with preserving the club 's century-old tradition . "
iron men defy odds and oppression fc union berlin was founded in 1906 by metalworkers in the industrial district of koepenick in the east of the city .
union supporters ‘ rapturous chant " eisern union " - meaning " iron union " - first echoed through the old forestry stadium in the 1920s .
after world war two , berlin was divided and union berlin played in the leagues of the then communist east germany .
union berlin enjoyed cult status as the club of non-conformists and of all east berliners opposing the regime .
their eternal rivals in the city were bfc dynamo , a club run by the dreaded stasi secret police .
" they had a lot of money and they had the best players , " recalls thommy thiele , an union fan since he was 13 years old .
" we hated the bfc dynamo , we hated the secret service , we hated the berlin wall , we were in opposition to the state , " he told dw radio .
" that ’ s why in the 1980s there were over 20,000 people in the fc union stadium every match and only 5,000 people at bfc dynamo . "
after german unification in 1990 , fc union berlin experienced difficult economic times in professional soccer .
the club frequently hovered on the brink of insolvency .
there were fan protests at berlin ’ s brandenburg gate to force the city government to transform the stadium into club property .
in 2004 , union supporters donated blood to earn enough funds for the club to get dfb approval to play the next season .
new stadium ushers in new era those trying days have forged the club together , the fans say .
" the manager , the president , the coach , the team and the supporters make up a whole system , " says thommy thiele .
" dirk zingler , our president , was standing in the stadium behind me 20 years ago .
he is one of us , a part of the family . "
while the hard-working fans sweat it out on the stadium terraces , they can watch the players give their all on the training ground right next door .
to see the new oval rise from the rubble of the old stadium has been a huge boost for the team ’ s morale , said club coach uwe neuhaus .
" the team is well aware of the close bonds within the club .
this is something special and is currently being underscored by the fans very impressively . "
on saturday , coach neuhaus and the team paid back their debt to the fans by clinching promotion to the second division .
ironically , the victory came in the stadium of the hated bfc dynamo , where the team has played throughout the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union player macchambes younga-mouhani -lrb- 2.v.r -rrb- scores opening goal against jahn regensburg promotion to the second bundesliga ushers in new challenges for union berlin , said thommy thiele .
but even if the club will have to struggle commercially , as well as on the pitch , the iron-willed union community can never be broken up .
" we have to maintain our spirit .
we have a lot of common people in our community and there is not a lot of money .
in the third division , the second division , the first division or the fourth division , i don ’ t care .
fc union is important , not the league we play in . "
the new old forestry stadium is to be officially be inaugurated on july 8 , 2008 with a friendly against berlin ’ s top club hertha bsc .

the " iron men " - as they are popularly known - have gained notoriety over the past 11 months as their unique fans have been tranforming their old stadium into a modern soccer arena .
" this is the most unique experience of my career , " sylvia weisheit told dw radio .
weisheit , who has been a die-hard union berlin fan for the past three decades , is the manager of the stadium construction project .
" the fans spend their free time and holidays working at the constuction site .
they are totally committed to the community , and any company would be glad to have such workers . "
the middle-aged blonde is one of only about six to 10 professional builders at the site .
the rest of the 60 to 80 workers turning up each morning at 7 a.m. are union supporters .
iron men with an iron will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union fans toil for club glory since construction of the new stadium began last june , around 1,600 volunteers have put in an estimated 90,000 hours of work .
they have saved the club two million euros from the overall construction costs of 15 million euros .
the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- had threatend to close the club ’ s old forestry stadium , which dates back to the 1920s .
dfb offcials said it no longer met the security requirements of professional soccer in germany .
michael - or " kibi " as he likes to be known - said the dfb 's decision was a test of union supporters unique fan culture .
describing the club as a big family bound together by more than just football he said : " union is a social event .
we ’ ve got the spirit of a neighborhood club where everyone sticks together . "
the stadium construction project was proof , he said , that it is possible to combine " commercial soccer with preserving the club 's century-old tradition . "
iron men defy odds and oppression fc union berlin was founded in 1906 by metalworkers in the industrial district of koepenick in the east of the city .
union supporters ‘ rapturous chant " eisern union " - meaning " iron union " - first echoed through the old forestry stadium in the 1920s .
after world war two , berlin was divided and union berlin played in the leagues of the then communist east germany .
union berlin enjoyed cult status as the club of non-conformists and of all east berliners opposing the regime .
their eternal rivals in the city were bfc dynamo , a club run by the dreaded stasi secret police .
" they had a lot of money and they had the best players , " recalls thommy thiele , an union fan since he was 13 years old .
" we hated the bfc dynamo , we hated the secret service , we hated the berlin wall , we were in opposition to the state , " he told dw radio .
" that ’ s why in the 1980s there were over 20,000 people in the fc union stadium every match and only 5,000 people at bfc dynamo . "
after german unification in 1990 , fc union berlin experienced difficult economic times in professional soccer .
the club frequently hovered on the brink of insolvency .
there were fan protests at berlin ’ s brandenburg gate to force the city government to transform the stadium into club property .
in 2004 , union supporters donated blood to earn enough funds for the club to get dfb approval to play the next season .
new stadium ushers in new era those trying days have forged the club together , the fans say .
" the manager , the president , the coach , the team and the supporters make up a whole system , " says thommy thiele .
" dirk zingler , our president , was standing in the stadium behind me 20 years ago .
he is one of us , a part of the family . "
while the hard-working fans sweat it out on the stadium terraces , they can watch the players give their all on the training ground right next door .
to see the new oval rise from the rubble of the old stadium has been a huge boost for the team ’ s morale , said club coach uwe neuhaus .
" the team is well aware of the close bonds within the club .
this is something special and is currently being underscored by the fans very impressively . "
on saturday , coach neuhaus and the team paid back their debt to the fans by clinching promotion to the second division .
ironically , the victory came in the stadium of the hated bfc dynamo , where the team has played throughout the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union player macchambes younga-mouhani -lrb- 2.v.r -rrb- scores opening goal against jahn regensburg promotion to the second bundesliga ushers in new challenges for union berlin , said thommy thiele .
but even if the club will have to struggle commercially , as well as on the pitch , the iron-willed union community can never be broken up .
" we have to maintain our spirit .
we have a lot of common people in our community and there is not a lot of money .
in the third division , the second division , the first division or the fourth division , i don ’ t care .
fc union is important , not the league we play in . "
the new old forestry stadium is to be officially be inaugurated on july 8 , 2008 with a friendly against berlin ’ s top club hertha bsc .

the " iron men " - as they are popularly known - have gained notoriety over the past 11 months as their unique fans have been tranforming their old stadium into a modern soccer arena .
" this is the most unique experience of my career , " sylvia weisheit told dw radio .
weisheit , who has been a die-hard union berlin fan for the past three decades , is the manager of the stadium construction project .
" the fans spend their free time and holidays working at the constuction site .
they are totally committed to the community , and any company would be glad to have such workers . "
the middle-aged blonde is one of only about six to 10 professional builders at the site .
the rest of the 60 to 80 workers turning up each morning at 7 a.m. are union supporters .
iron men with an iron will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union fans toil for club glory since construction of the new stadium began last june , around 1,600 volunteers have put in an estimated 90,000 hours of work .
they have saved the club two million euros from the overall construction costs of 15 million euros .
the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- had threatend to close the club ’ s old forestry stadium , which dates back to the 1920s .
dfb offcials said it no longer met the security requirements of professional soccer in germany .
michael - or " kibi " as he likes to be known - said the dfb 's decision was a test of union supporters unique fan culture .
describing the club as a big family bound together by more than just football he said : " union is a social event .
we ’ ve got the spirit of a neighborhood club where everyone sticks together . "
the stadium construction project was proof , he said , that it is possible to combine " commercial soccer with preserving the club 's century-old tradition . "
iron men defy odds and oppression fc union berlin was founded in 1906 by metalworkers in the industrial district of koepenick in the east of the city .
union supporters ‘ rapturous chant " eisern union " - meaning " iron union " - first echoed through the old forestry stadium in the 1920s .
after world war two , berlin was divided and union berlin played in the leagues of the then communist east germany .
union berlin enjoyed cult status as the club of non-conformists and of all east berliners opposing the regime .
their eternal rivals in the city were bfc dynamo , a club run by the dreaded stasi secret police .
" they had a lot of money and they had the best players , " recalls thommy thiele , an union fan since he was 13 years old .
" we hated the bfc dynamo , we hated the secret service , we hated the berlin wall , we were in opposition to the state , " he told dw radio .
" that ’ s why in the 1980s there were over 20,000 people in the fc union stadium every match and only 5,000 people at bfc dynamo . "
after german unification in 1990 , fc union berlin experienced difficult economic times in professional soccer .
the club frequently hovered on the brink of insolvency .
there were fan protests at berlin ’ s brandenburg gate to force the city government to transform the stadium into club property .
in 2004 , union supporters donated blood to earn enough funds for the club to get dfb approval to play the next season .
new stadium ushers in new era those trying days have forged the club together , the fans say .
" the manager , the president , the coach , the team and the supporters make up a whole system , " says thommy thiele .
" dirk zingler , our president , was standing in the stadium behind me 20 years ago .
he is one of us , a part of the family . "
while the hard-working fans sweat it out on the stadium terraces , they can watch the players give their all on the training ground right next door .
to see the new oval rise from the rubble of the old stadium has been a huge boost for the team ’ s morale , said club coach uwe neuhaus .
" the team is well aware of the close bonds within the club .
this is something special and is currently being underscored by the fans very impressively . "
on saturday , coach neuhaus and the team paid back their debt to the fans by clinching promotion to the second division .
ironically , the victory came in the stadium of the hated bfc dynamo , where the team has played throughout the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union player macchambes younga-mouhani -lrb- 2.v.r -rrb- scores opening goal against jahn regensburg promotion to the second bundesliga ushers in new challenges for union berlin , said thommy thiele .
but even if the club will have to struggle commercially , as well as on the pitch , the iron-willed union community can never be broken up .
" we have to maintain our spirit .
we have a lot of common people in our community and there is not a lot of money .
in the third division , the second division , the first division or the fourth division , i don ’ t care .
fc union is important , not the league we play in . "
the new old forestry stadium is to be officially be inaugurated on july 8 , 2008 with a friendly against berlin ’ s top club hertha bsc .

he has used a speech to seek to heal the wounds created by , among other things , his reinstatement of a holocaust-denying bishop . the pope has begun his landmark , five-day trip to israel and the palestinian territories by condemning the holocaust and lingering anti-semitism , and calling for a " just and lasting solution " to the middle east conflict .
" tragically , the jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person , " he said at tel aviv 's ben-gurion airport .
he then went on to challenge israel 's conservative government by calling for the creation of a palestinian state .
" i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the six million jewish victims of the shoah , " the german-born pope said , using the hebrew term for the holocaust , " and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude . "
benedict , only the third reigning pope to visit the region , said : " i come , like so many others before me , to pray at the holy places , to pray especially for peace - peace in the holy land and peace throughout the world . "
pope deplores anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres , right , called the pope 's visit a " mission of peace " benedict recently angered many jews by lifting the excommunication on a holocaust-denying bishop .
he caused further anger by backing the beatification of controversial nazi-era pope pius xii .
" sadly , anti-semitism continues to raise its ugly head in parts of the world , " said the pontiff , calling this " totally unacceptable " and declaring " every effort " must be made to combat anti-semitism .
in the 45 years since the second vatican council repudiated the concept of collective jewish guilt for christ 's death , catholic-jewish relations have been haunted by the holocaust and the question of what the church did , or failed to do , about it .
they went through one of their worst periods after the pope in january lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops , including one who denied that six million jews were killed .
the vatican says it had not known enough about that british bishop 's past and the church and jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to yad vashem in jerusalem , israel 's memorial to the victims of the holocaust .
calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu , left , did not directly respond to the pope 's call for a palestinian state israeli president shimon peres , the country 's official head of state whose duties are largely ceremonial , welcomed pope benedict , calling his visit to the holy land a " mission of peace " and of " planting the seeds of tolerance and uprooting the weeds of fanaticism . "
the politically moderate peres also expressed hope for a lasting peace in the middle east .
" we 've made peace with egypt and jordan and we are negotiating peace with the palestinians .
we may also arrive at a comprehensive regional peace here in the near future .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a hardliner , who since taking office in late march following february 10 elections has refrained from openly committing to the establishment of a palestinian state , did not make a speech at the airport .
" it 's a pleasure to welcome you to the holy land , " he said as he shook benedict 's hand once the pontiff alighted from the royal jordanian aircraft , which had flown him from amman , jordan , where he had arrived on friday .
a " religious pilgrimage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope toured a mosque during a visit to jordan the catholic church has made a point of emphasizing that this is not a state visit by the head of the vatican , but a non-political , religious pilgrimage by its spiritual leader .
yet the visit is being seen as another milestone in israel-vatican relations , which have been historically tumultuous and were only formalized in 1993 .

" tragically , the jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person , " he said at tel aviv 's ben-gurion airport .
he then went on to challenge israel 's conservative government by calling for the creation of a palestinian state .
" i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the six million jewish victims of the shoah , " the german-born pope said , using the hebrew term for the holocaust , " and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude . "
benedict , only the third reigning pope to visit the region , said : " i come , like so many others before me , to pray at the holy places , to pray especially for peace - peace in the holy land and peace throughout the world . "
pope deplores anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres , right , called the pope 's visit a " mission of peace " benedict recently angered many jews by lifting the excommunication on a holocaust-denying bishop .
he caused further anger by backing the beatification of controversial nazi-era pope pius xii .
" sadly , anti-semitism continues to raise its ugly head in parts of the world , " said the pontiff , calling this " totally unacceptable " and declaring " every effort " must be made to combat anti-semitism .
in the 45 years since the second vatican council repudiated the concept of collective jewish guilt for christ 's death , catholic-jewish relations have been haunted by the holocaust and the question of what the church did , or failed to do , about it .
they went through one of their worst periods after the pope in january lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops , including one who denied that six million jews were killed .
the vatican says it had not known enough about that british bishop 's past and the church and jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to yad vashem in jerusalem , israel 's memorial to the victims of the holocaust .
calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu , left , did not directly respond to the pope 's call for a palestinian state israeli president shimon peres , the country 's official head of state whose duties are largely ceremonial , welcomed pope benedict , calling his visit to the holy land a " mission of peace " and of " planting the seeds of tolerance and uprooting the weeds of fanaticism . "
the politically moderate peres also expressed hope for a lasting peace in the middle east .
" we 've made peace with egypt and jordan and we are negotiating peace with the palestinians .
we may also arrive at a comprehensive regional peace here in the near future .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a hardliner , who since taking office in late march following february 10 elections has refrained from openly committing to the establishment of a palestinian state , did not make a speech at the airport .
" it 's a pleasure to welcome you to the holy land , " he said as he shook benedict 's hand once the pontiff alighted from the royal jordanian aircraft , which had flown him from amman , jordan , where he had arrived on friday .
a " religious pilgrimage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope toured a mosque during a visit to jordan the catholic church has made a point of emphasizing that this is not a state visit by the head of the vatican , but a non-political , religious pilgrimage by its spiritual leader .
yet the visit is being seen as another milestone in israel-vatican relations , which have been historically tumultuous and were only formalized in 1993 .
the first reigning pope to visit was paul xi in 1964 , who made a one-day stopover from jordan , but refrained from mentioning israel by name , or meeting israeli leaders in jerusalem .
the second was john paul ii , who made a highly successful and emotional visit in 2000 .
after his stop at the airport , the pontiff later flew by israeli military helicopter to jerusalem .
the pope planned to visit the memorial of jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust remembrance institute .

" basically if you did n't have oceans you would n't have a climate ... that sort of link and understanding is n't being talked about in climate change discussions , " jacqueline alder , head of the marine unit of the united nations environment program told news agency afp . the conference , which opened monday and lasts until friday , has drawn environmental experts , officials and ministers from 120 nations .
one of the main aims is to create a forum to coordinate international conservation efforts to counter the impact of rising sea levels and dwindling fish stocks blamed on higher temperatures . scientists warn of dramatic consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is tight for the conference in manado , sulawesi richard spinrad of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- said scientists are no longer ruling out a rise in sea levels by a whole meter in this century .
the world 's oceans absorb 22 million tons of carbon dioxide daily and acidity levels have risen by a third over the last 100 years , he added . scientists also say rising temperatures and over-fishing could lead to the collapse of key species that feed millions and help preserve vital ecosystems . " we 've calculated that if carbon emissions are n't cut , then in the long-term we 'll see the creation of large death zones in the seas at a depth of 200 and 800 meters which will hardly have any oxygen , " hans joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate change research told german newspaper die zeit recently . schellnhuber , who is chancellor angela merkel 's advisor on climate change , warned of dramatic consequences for fishing and world food supplies . indonesia pushes for special status for oceans indonesia , an archipelago nation of 17,000 islands , is pushing for recognition of the role of oceans in absorbing carbon dioxide which is blamed for global warming .
the government in jakarta has said it wants special status for oceans written into the successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . " it is clear that our precious marine resources are under dire and increasing threat and that in many parts of the world climate change will accelerate their destruction , " indonesian maritime affairs and fisheries minister freddy numberi said .
" adaptation and mitigation measures are urgently needed to be taken up not only to save marine and coastal resources but also to save the coastal communities . " saving coastal communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 150 million people in indonesia 's rely on the sea for their livelihood an estimated 150 people in the region are dependant on the ocean for their livelihood .
but pollution , tourism and illegal fishing have caused huge damage to indonesia 's marine ecosystems . " for the people here , the ocean provides everything they need to live - much more than in industrialized nations .
they 're totally dependant on the ocean 's resources , " tim jennerjahn , a biochemist at the leibnitz center for marine tropical ecology in bremen told german public broadcaster zdf . jennerjahn , who heads a joint german-indonesian project for the protection of indonesia 's coastline , said the aim was to create a sustainable coastal management system .
" that 's why it 's important that we present the project at the world ocean conference , " he said . meanwhile , leaders from six countries - east timor , indonesia , malaysia , papua new guinea , the philippines and the solomon islands - will meet on the margins of the conference to launch a plan to save the coral triangle , a vast underwater ecosystem that is home to more than half the world 's coral reefs . sp / sms , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" basically if you did n't have oceans you would n't have a climate ... that sort of link and understanding is n't being talked about in climate change discussions , " jacqueline alder , head of the marine unit of the united nations environment program told news agency afp . the conference , which opened monday and lasts until friday , has drawn environmental experts , officials and ministers from 120 nations .
one of the main aims is to create a forum to coordinate international conservation efforts to counter the impact of rising sea levels and dwindling fish stocks blamed on higher temperatures . scientists warn of dramatic consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is tight for the conference in manado , sulawesi richard spinrad of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- said scientists are no longer ruling out a rise in sea levels by a whole meter in this century .
the world 's oceans absorb 22 million tons of carbon dioxide daily and acidity levels have risen by a third over the last 100 years , he added . scientists also say rising temperatures and over-fishing could lead to the collapse of key species that feed millions and help preserve vital ecosystems . " we 've calculated that if carbon emissions are n't cut , then in the long-term we 'll see the creation of large death zones in the seas at a depth of 200 and 800 meters which will hardly have any oxygen , " hans joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate change research told german newspaper die zeit recently . schellnhuber , who is chancellor angela merkel 's advisor on climate change , warned of dramatic consequences for fishing and world food supplies . indonesia pushes for special status for oceans indonesia , an archipelago nation of 17,000 islands , is pushing for recognition of the role of oceans in absorbing carbon dioxide which is blamed for global warming .
the government in jakarta has said it wants special status for oceans written into the successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . " it is clear that our precious marine resources are under dire and increasing threat and that in many parts of the world climate change will accelerate their destruction , " indonesian maritime affairs and fisheries minister freddy numberi said .
" adaptation and mitigation measures are urgently needed to be taken up not only to save marine and coastal resources but also to save the coastal communities . " saving coastal communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 150 million people in indonesia 's rely on the sea for their livelihood an estimated 150 people in the region are dependant on the ocean for their livelihood .
but pollution , tourism and illegal fishing have caused huge damage to indonesia 's marine ecosystems . " for the people here , the ocean provides everything they need to live - much more than in industrialized nations .
they 're totally dependant on the ocean 's resources , " tim jennerjahn , a biochemist at the leibnitz center for marine tropical ecology in bremen told german public broadcaster zdf . jennerjahn , who heads a joint german-indonesian project for the protection of indonesia 's coastline , said the aim was to create a sustainable coastal management system .
" that 's why it 's important that we present the project at the world ocean conference , " he said . meanwhile , leaders from six countries - east timor , indonesia , malaysia , papua new guinea , the philippines and the solomon islands - will meet on the margins of the conference to launch a plan to save the coral triangle , a vast underwater ecosystem that is home to more than half the world 's coral reefs . sp / sms , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " iron men " - as they are popularly known - have gained notoriety over the past 11 months as their unique fans have been tranforming their old stadium into a modern soccer arena .
" this is the most unique experience of my career , " sylvia weisheit told dw radio .
weisheit , who has been a die-hard union berlin fan for the past three decades , is the manager of the stadium construction project .
" the fans spend their free time and holidays working at the constuction site .
they are totally committed to the community , and any company would be glad to have such workers . "
the middle-aged blonde is one of only about six to 10 professional builders at the site .
the rest of the 60 to 80 workers turning up each morning at 7 a.m. are union supporters .
iron men with an iron will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union fans toil for club glory since construction of the new stadium began last june , around 1,600 volunteers have put in an estimated 90,000 hours of work .
they have saved the club two million euros from the overall construction costs of 15 million euros .
the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- had threatend to close the club ’ s old forestry stadium , which dates back to the 1920s .
dfb offcials said it no longer met the security requirements of professional soccer in germany .
michael - or " kibi " as he likes to be known - said the dfb 's decision was a test of union supporters unique fan culture .
describing the club as a big family bound together by more than just football he said : " union is a social event .
we ’ ve got the spirit of a neighborhood club where everyone sticks together . "
the stadium construction project was proof , he said , that it is possible to combine " commercial soccer with preserving the club 's century-old tradition . "
iron men defy odds and oppression fc union berlin was founded in 1906 by metalworkers in the industrial district of koepenick in the east of the city .
union supporters ‘ rapturous chant " eisern union " - meaning " iron union " - first echoed through the old forestry stadium in the 1920s .
after world war two , berlin was divided and union berlin played in the leagues of the then communist east germany .
union berlin enjoyed cult status as the club of non-conformists and of all east berliners opposing the regime .
their eternal rivals in the city were bfc dynamo , a club run by the dreaded stasi secret police .
" they had a lot of money and they had the best players , " recalls thommy thiele , an union fan since he was 13 years old .
" we hated the bfc dynamo , we hated the secret service , we hated the berlin wall , we were in opposition to the state , " he told dw radio .
" that ’ s why in the 1980s there were over 20,000 people in the fc union stadium every match and only 5,000 people at bfc dynamo . "
after german unification in 1990 , fc union berlin experienced difficult economic times in professional soccer .
the club frequently hovered on the brink of insolvency .
there were fan protests at berlin ’ s brandenburg gate to force the city government to transform the stadium into club property .
in 2004 , union supporters donated blood to earn enough funds for the club to get dfb approval to play the next season .
new stadium ushers in new era those trying days have forged the club together , the fans say .
" the manager , the president , the coach , the team and the supporters make up a whole system , " says thommy thiele .
" dirk zingler , our president , was standing in the stadium behind me 20 years ago .
he is one of us , a part of the family . "
while the hard-working fans sweat it out on the stadium terraces , they can watch the players give their all on the training ground right next door .
to see the new oval rise from the rubble of the old stadium has been a huge boost for the team ’ s morale , said club coach uwe neuhaus .
" the team is well aware of the close bonds within the club .
this is something special and is currently being underscored by the fans very impressively . "
on saturday , coach neuhaus and the team paid back their debt to the fans by clinching promotion to the second division .
ironically , the victory came in the stadium of the hated bfc dynamo , where the team has played throughout the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union player macchambes younga-mouhani -lrb- 2.v.r -rrb- scores opening goal against jahn regensburg promotion to the second bundesliga ushers in new challenges for union berlin , said thommy thiele .
but even if the club will have to struggle commercially , as well as on the pitch , the iron-willed union community can never be broken up .
" we have to maintain our spirit .
we have a lot of common people in our community and there is not a lot of money .
in the third division , the second division , the first division or the fourth division , i don ’ t care .
fc union is important , not the league we play in . "
the new old forestry stadium is to be officially be inaugurated on july 8 , 2008 with a friendly against berlin ’ s top club hertha bsc .

" basically if you did n't have oceans you would n't have a climate ... that sort of link and understanding is n't being talked about in climate change discussions , " jacqueline alder , head of the marine unit of the united nations environment program told news agency afp . the conference , which opened monday and lasts until friday , has drawn environmental experts , officials and ministers from 120 nations .
one of the main aims is to create a forum to coordinate international conservation efforts to counter the impact of rising sea levels and dwindling fish stocks blamed on higher temperatures . scientists warn of dramatic consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is tight for the conference in manado , sulawesi richard spinrad of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- said scientists are no longer ruling out a rise in sea levels by a whole meter in this century .
the world 's oceans absorb 22 million tons of carbon dioxide daily and acidity levels have risen by a third over the last 100 years , he added . scientists also say rising temperatures and over-fishing could lead to the collapse of key species that feed millions and help preserve vital ecosystems . " we 've calculated that if carbon emissions are n't cut , then in the long-term we 'll see the creation of large death zones in the seas at a depth of 200 and 800 meters which will hardly have any oxygen , " hans joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate change research told german newspaper die zeit recently . schellnhuber , who is chancellor angela merkel 's advisor on climate change , warned of dramatic consequences for fishing and world food supplies . indonesia pushes for special status for oceans indonesia , an archipelago nation of 17,000 islands , is pushing for recognition of the role of oceans in absorbing carbon dioxide which is blamed for global warming .
the government in jakarta has said it wants special status for oceans written into the successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . " it is clear that our precious marine resources are under dire and increasing threat and that in many parts of the world climate change will accelerate their destruction , " indonesian maritime affairs and fisheries minister freddy numberi said .
" adaptation and mitigation measures are urgently needed to be taken up not only to save marine and coastal resources but also to save the coastal communities . " saving coastal communities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 150 million people in indonesia 's rely on the sea for their livelihood an estimated 150 people in the region are dependant on the ocean for their livelihood .
but pollution , tourism and illegal fishing have caused huge damage to indonesia 's marine ecosystems . " for the people here , the ocean provides everything they need to live - much more than in industrialized nations .
they 're totally dependant on the ocean 's resources , " tim jennerjahn , a biochemist at the leibnitz center for marine tropical ecology in bremen told german public broadcaster zdf . jennerjahn , who heads a joint german-indonesian project for the protection of indonesia 's coastline , said the aim was to create a sustainable coastal management system .
" that 's why it 's important that we present the project at the world ocean conference , " he said . meanwhile , leaders from six countries - east timor , indonesia , malaysia , papua new guinea , the philippines and the solomon islands - will meet on the margins of the conference to launch a plan to save the coral triangle , a vast underwater ecosystem that is home to more than half the world 's coral reefs . sp / sms , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

much uncertainty remains , including who will own the auto giant and what city the company will call home . managers , lawyers and consultants from volkswagen and porsche began meetings on monday to discuss ways to bring the two german carmakers together into an integrated auto group , german press agency dpa reported , adding that it was still too early for talk among top executives . the two automakers have said they hope to be in a position to present a final merger plan by early-june , dpa reported .
many analysts have recently said negotiations will have to address a number of touchy subjects before a deal can be announced . " it 's not really clear how they will construct -lsb- the new company -rsb- , " juergen pieper from metzler bank told the afp news agency . contentious questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of both carmakers are wondering if factories will be shut or moved when company executives outlined merger plans on may 6 , they knew questions about where the resulting auto group would be based , who owns how much of the carmakers and who runs the company 's operations would be among the most contentious issues up for negotiation . " it is not a marriage made in heaven , but a marriage of convenience , " porsche boss wendelin wiedeking told the luxury sports carmaker 's workers may 7 . german media have reported that the new auto group is considering setting up its headquarters in either wolfsburg , where vw is currently based , or hannover , the capital of the state of lower saxony , which is a major volkswagen shareholder . porsche officials , however , said on monday that the location of the future carmaker 's headquarters remained uncertain .
porsche is based in the southern german city of stuttgart . even more important than where the offices are located is who will land in the vw-porsche driver 's seat .
in addition to vw chairman martin winterkorn and porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking , weekly news magazine focus reported the possibility that a " neutral " manager could take over . fresh start after long-running feud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche and volkswagen have been clashing for years audi boss rupert stadler is also being eyed for the top vw-porsche position , the magazine said , adding that he could represent a fresh start for porsche and volkswagen as a confidant of the porsche and piech families - who own porsche - and is also supported by lower saxony premier christian wulff , who control 's the state 's 20 percent stake in vw , and volkswagen 's ferdinand piech . the two carmakers have a long history of competition and strife due to personal and professional relationships among their founders , heads and supervisory board members .
porsche racked up some nine billion euros in debt trying to takeover vw , europe 's largest automaker and a company about 15 times larger than the luxury car firm . porsche spokesman albrecht bamler said company officials had not yet discussed who would head the company . the porsche and piech families would own between 45 percent and 55 percent of the merged company 's shares while lower saxony would have 21 percent to 25 percent , germany 's der spiegel magazine reported . plans to merge porsche and volkswagen into a single auto group would have to be approved by supervisory boards and shareholders at both companies .
if all involved agree to the deal , the resulting supervisory board would be responsible for naming the group 's boss . sms / pfd , ap / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 11.05.2009 pope seeks to salve holocaust wounds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict called on israeli leaders to find a solution to the middle east conflict pope benedict xvi is on his first trip to israel .
he has used a speech to seek to heal the wounds created by , among other things , his reinstatement of a holocaust-denying bishop . the pope has begun his landmark , five-day trip to israel and the palestinian territories by condemning the holocaust and lingering anti-semitism , and calling for a " just and lasting solution " to the middle east conflict .
" tragically , the jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person , " he said at tel aviv 's ben-gurion airport .
he then went on to challenge israel 's conservative government by calling for the creation of a palestinian state .
" i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the six million jewish victims of the shoah , " the german-born pope said , using the hebrew term for the holocaust , " and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude . "
benedict , only the third reigning pope to visit the region , said : " i come , like so many others before me , to pray at the holy places , to pray especially for peace - peace in the holy land and peace throughout the world . "
pope deplores anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres , right , called the pope 's visit a " mission of peace " benedict recently angered many jews by lifting the excommunication on a holocaust-denying bishop .
he caused further anger by backing the beatification of controversial nazi-era pope pius xii .
" sadly , anti-semitism continues to raise its ugly head in parts of the world , " said the pontiff , calling this " totally unacceptable " and declaring " every effort " must be made to combat anti-semitism .
in the 45 years since the second vatican council repudiated the concept of collective jewish guilt for christ 's death , catholic-jewish relations have been haunted by the holocaust and the question of what the church did , or failed to do , about it .
they went through one of their worst periods after the pope in january lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops , including one who denied that six million jews were killed .
the vatican says it had not known enough about that british bishop 's past and the church and jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to yad vashem in jerusalem , israel 's memorial to the victims of the holocaust .
calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu , left , did not directly respond to the pope 's call for a palestinian state israeli president shimon peres , the country 's official head of state whose duties are largely ceremonial , welcomed pope benedict , calling his visit to the holy land a " mission of peace " and of " planting the seeds of tolerance and uprooting the weeds of fanaticism . "
the politically moderate peres also expressed hope for a lasting peace in the middle east .
" we 've made peace with egypt and jordan and we are negotiating peace with the palestinians .
we may also arrive at a comprehensive regional peace here in the near future .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a hardliner , who since taking office in late march following february 10 elections has refrained from openly committing to the establishment of a palestinian state , did not make a speech at the airport .
" it 's a pleasure to welcome you to the holy land , " he said as he shook benedict 's hand once the pontiff alighted from the royal jordanian aircraft , which had flown him from amman , jordan , where he had arrived on friday .
a " religious pilgrimage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope toured a mosque during a visit to jordan the catholic church has made a point of emphasizing that this is not a state visit by the head of the vatican , but a non-political , religious pilgrimage by its spiritual leader .
yet the visit is being seen as another milestone in israel-vatican relations , which have been historically tumultuous and were only formalized in 1993 .
the first reigning pope to visit was paul xi in 1964 , who made a one-day stopover from jordan , but refrained from mentioning israel by name , or meeting israeli leaders in jerusalem .
the second was john paul ii , who made a highly successful and emotional visit in 2000 .
after his stop at the airport , the pontiff later flew by israeli military helicopter to jerusalem .
the pope planned to visit the memorial of jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust remembrance institute .
but he had no plans to visit the museum , which accuses pope pius xii of being silent in the face of the suffering of the jews . nt / pfd , reuters / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is very little room for tax cuts and no one can say right now when the time will be right , " schaeuble said .
" new tax revenue estimates due later in may will show just how limited the scope for tax relief is . "
berlin is expected to slash its tax revenue estimates for 2009 by 48 billion euros -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- later this week .
however , chancellor merkel is sticking to her pledge .
in an interview on german public television , she said that tax relief could help the stimulate sluggish german economy .
" we need to mobilize all our forces to foster growth , " she said .
merkel is promising a three-pronged approach of tax relief , deficit cuts and investment in education and innovation .
schaeuble 's doubts echoed the difference in opinion does n't end with schaeuble .
several cdu state premiers had already criticized her plans to make tax relief a key plank of the party 's election campaign program .
the cdu premier of thuringia , dieter althaus , also said this weekend that his party had an obligation to be a guarantor of solid state finances .
horst seehofer , the head of the cdu 's sister party in bavaria , the christian social union , also raised his doubts .
" one is not allowed to make promises that one ca n't keep to , " he said .
the divisions over the tax issue could hurt merkel in september 's election , despite her current lead of 10 points over the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , her partners in government .
merkel had been hoping she would coast to re-election this year on her economic record and the promise of tax cuts .
things look rather different now , however , as the global financial crisis has plunged germany into its deepest recession since world war ii and the economic and fiscal gains from her first three years in office now just a distant memory . cg / jk , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vatican says it did not know enough about the bishop 's past and both sides now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit to jerusalem 's yad vashem memorial to holocaust victims .
most jewish leaders now consider the episode to have been put to rest - but not all .
the dorot hemeshech association of holocaust survivors has called on drivers to blow their car horns during the pope 's speech at yad vashem .
" israelis will this way express their disapproval of the pope who encourages holocaust denial and anti-semitism , " the association said .
the german-born pontiff 's membership in the hitler youth , although it was forced , has also angered holocaust survivors .
in addition , a group of far-right activists has said they plan to press criminal charges against the pope over vatican treasures they claim were plundered from jewish people , while nitzan horowitz , a gay rights activist and a left-wing parliamentarian , will boycott all official ceremonies held for the pope .
" pope benedict xvi is responsible for the suffering of thousands of people in the world , " horowitz said .

the vatican supports a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which also has internationally backing .
pope benedict will be welcomed by israeli president shimon peres and the country 's new , right-leaning prime minister , benjamin netanyahu .
since being sworn in to power at the end of march , netanyahu has so far refused to publicly endorse the creation of a palestinian state .
he did , however , say on sunday that israel will try to ease restrictions on palestinians in the west bank .
" i think we need to make a big effort , within the given security constraints , to make things easier for the palestinians , " netanyahu reportedly told ministers during a cabinet meeting .

following an aborted action by germany 's elite anti-terrorism police unit , the gsg 9 , to free a kidnapped freighter in somalia , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble wants to broaden the mandate of the bundeswehr . by a constitutional change the german military would be made responsible for an area which has until now been the province of the police .
" under the constitution , the gsg 9 is responsible for these kind of eventualities , but really , it should be the military 's duty .
for them to do this duty , though , we have to lay the legal foundations , and that means changing the constitution , " schaeuble said in an interview with the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble , pushing for constitutional change the minister said it was decided to send the gsg 9 to africa because the bundeswehr alone could n't come up with the necessary resources to carry out a hostage liberation at sea .
shortly before the planned operation could take place , consultations with the officer in command led to its cancellation .
before the gsg 9 could reach the scene , the kidnappers had brought the ship into port .
the situation became much more dangerous , as more pirates had gone aboard and the risk that police or hostages could be killed in an operation became too high .
the weekly magazine der spiegel tells the story somewhat differently .
the magazine says a gsg 9 dress rehearsal aboard the us helicopter ship " boxer " was a success , but at the last minute the us withdrew support for the operation .
der spiegel also blamed coordination difficulties between the operational commander and high command in berlin .
on top of that , they say there were conflicts between the gsg 9 and the bundeswehr .
the gsg 9 are better trained for hostage operations than the military 's special forces , but for the transport abroad they depended on the army .
schaeuble said the constitutional changes he has recommended are provided for under the coalition agreement between the christian democratic union and the social democratic party , but he criticized that the social democrats have so far blocked the changes . ch / ai , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has used a speech to seek to heal the wounds created by , among other things , his reinstatement of a holocaust-denying bishop . the pope has begun his landmark , five-day trip to israel and the palestinian territories by condemning the holocaust and lingering anti-semitism , and calling for a " just and lasting solution " to the middle east conflict .
" tragically , the jewish people have experienced the terrible circumstances of ideologies that deny the fundamental dignity of every human person , " he said at tel aviv 's ben-gurion airport .
he then went on to challenge israel 's conservative government by calling for the creation of a palestinian state .
" i will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the six million jewish victims of the shoah , " the german-born pope said , using the hebrew term for the holocaust , " and to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude . "
benedict , only the third reigning pope to visit the region , said : " i come , like so many others before me , to pray at the holy places , to pray especially for peace - peace in the holy land and peace throughout the world . "
pope deplores anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peres , right , called the pope 's visit a " mission of peace " benedict recently angered many jews by lifting the excommunication on a holocaust-denying bishop .
he caused further anger by backing the beatification of controversial nazi-era pope pius xii .
" sadly , anti-semitism continues to raise its ugly head in parts of the world , " said the pontiff , calling this " totally unacceptable " and declaring " every effort " must be made to combat anti-semitism .
in the 45 years since the second vatican council repudiated the concept of collective jewish guilt for christ 's death , catholic-jewish relations have been haunted by the holocaust and the question of what the church did , or failed to do , about it .
they went through one of their worst periods after the pope in january lifted the excommunication of four traditionalist bishops , including one who denied that six million jews were killed .
the vatican says it had not known enough about that british bishop 's past and the church and jewish religious leaders now hope the issue can be definitively closed with a visit later in the day by the pontiff to yad vashem in jerusalem , israel 's memorial to the victims of the holocaust .
calls for peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu , left , did not directly respond to the pope 's call for a palestinian state israeli president shimon peres , the country 's official head of state whose duties are largely ceremonial , welcomed pope benedict , calling his visit to the holy land a " mission of peace " and of " planting the seeds of tolerance and uprooting the weeds of fanaticism . "
the politically moderate peres also expressed hope for a lasting peace in the middle east .
" we 've made peace with egypt and jordan and we are negotiating peace with the palestinians .
we may also arrive at a comprehensive regional peace here in the near future .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a hardliner , who since taking office in late march following february 10 elections has refrained from openly committing to the establishment of a palestinian state , did not make a speech at the airport .
" it 's a pleasure to welcome you to the holy land , " he said as he shook benedict 's hand once the pontiff alighted from the royal jordanian aircraft , which had flown him from amman , jordan , where he had arrived on friday .
a " religious pilgrimage " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope toured a mosque during a visit to jordan the catholic church has made a point of emphasizing that this is not a state visit by the head of the vatican , but a non-political , religious pilgrimage by its spiritual leader .
yet the visit is being seen as another milestone in israel-vatican relations , which have been historically tumultuous and were only formalized in 1993 .
the first reigning pope to visit was paul xi in 1964 , who made a one-day stopover from jordan , but refrained from mentioning israel by name , or meeting israeli leaders in jerusalem .
the second was john paul ii , who made a highly successful and emotional visit in 2000 .
after his stop at the airport , the pontiff later flew by israeli military helicopter to jerusalem .
the pope planned to visit the memorial of jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust remembrance institute .
but he had no plans to visit the museum , which accuses pope pius xii of being silent in the face of the suffering of the jews . nt / pfd , reuters / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " iron men " - as they are popularly known - have gained notoriety over the past 11 months as their unique fans have been tranforming their old stadium into a modern soccer arena .
" this is the most unique experience of my career , " sylvia weisheit told dw radio .
weisheit , who has been a die-hard union berlin fan for the past three decades , is the manager of the stadium construction project .
" the fans spend their free time and holidays working at the constuction site .
they are totally committed to the community , and any company would be glad to have such workers . "
the middle-aged blonde is one of only about six to 10 professional builders at the site .
the rest of the 60 to 80 workers turning up each morning at 7 a.m. are union supporters .
iron men with an iron will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union fans toil for club glory since construction of the new stadium began last june , around 1,600 volunteers have put in an estimated 90,000 hours of work .
they have saved the club two million euros from the overall construction costs of 15 million euros .
the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- had threatend to close the club ’ s old forestry stadium , which dates back to the 1920s .
dfb offcials said it no longer met the security requirements of professional soccer in germany .
michael - or " kibi " as he likes to be known - said the dfb 's decision was a test of union supporters unique fan culture .
describing the club as a big family bound together by more than just football he said : " union is a social event .
we ’ ve got the spirit of a neighborhood club where everyone sticks together . "
the stadium construction project was proof , he said , that it is possible to combine " commercial soccer with preserving the club 's century-old tradition . "
iron men defy odds and oppression fc union berlin was founded in 1906 by metalworkers in the industrial district of koepenick in the east of the city .
union supporters ‘ rapturous chant " eisern union " - meaning " iron union " - first echoed through the old forestry stadium in the 1920s .
after world war two , berlin was divided and union berlin played in the leagues of the then communist east germany .
union berlin enjoyed cult status as the club of non-conformists and of all east berliners opposing the regime .
their eternal rivals in the city were bfc dynamo , a club run by the dreaded stasi secret police .
" they had a lot of money and they had the best players , " recalls thommy thiele , an union fan since he was 13 years old .
" we hated the bfc dynamo , we hated the secret service , we hated the berlin wall , we were in opposition to the state , " he told dw radio .
" that ’ s why in the 1980s there were over 20,000 people in the fc union stadium every match and only 5,000 people at bfc dynamo . "
after german unification in 1990 , fc union berlin experienced difficult economic times in professional soccer .
the club frequently hovered on the brink of insolvency .
there were fan protests at berlin ’ s brandenburg gate to force the city government to transform the stadium into club property .
in 2004 , union supporters donated blood to earn enough funds for the club to get dfb approval to play the next season .
new stadium ushers in new era those trying days have forged the club together , the fans say .
" the manager , the president , the coach , the team and the supporters make up a whole system , " says thommy thiele .
" dirk zingler , our president , was standing in the stadium behind me 20 years ago .
he is one of us , a part of the family . "
while the hard-working fans sweat it out on the stadium terraces , they can watch the players give their all on the training ground right next door .
to see the new oval rise from the rubble of the old stadium has been a huge boost for the team ’ s morale , said club coach uwe neuhaus .
" the team is well aware of the close bonds within the club .
this is something special and is currently being underscored by the fans very impressively . "
on saturday , coach neuhaus and the team paid back their debt to the fans by clinching promotion to the second division .
ironically , the victory came in the stadium of the hated bfc dynamo , where the team has played throughout the season .

but even if the club will have to struggle commercially , as well as on the pitch , the iron-willed union community can never be broken up .
" we have to maintain our spirit .
we have a lot of common people in our community and there is not a lot of money .
in the third division , the second division , the first division or the fourth division , i don ’ t care .
fc union is important , not the league we play in . "
the new old forestry stadium is to be officially be inaugurated on july 8 , 2008 with a friendly against berlin ’ s top club hertha bsc .

reports say more than 14 million euros were paid in a kickback scheme over several years . prosecutors in munich said they have reason to believe that the german truck maker had a system in place to " boost the sales of trucks and buses . "
that system allegedly included illegal payouts to man customers .
at times , bank accounts of relatives and friends were used to disguise the transactions , according to prosecutors .
between 2002 and 2005 , an estimated 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- in bribes are thought to have been paid out , the majority of it to customers outside of germany .
prosecutors did not specify exactly how many people were being investigated , but said the number is " well over 100 . "
that figure includes both man marketing staff and customers suspected of having taken illegal payoffs .
about 300 police personnel across germany are involved in the probe .
two people were arrested last week , although one was later released .
suspects could face charges for bribery and tax evasion .
corruption an issue in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is a leading german truck maker man , which has volkswagen as its dominant shareholder , said it was fully cooperating with the prosecutors .
prosecutors said the top management at man had not been implicated in the allegations , which arose after a tip-off from tax authorities .
the inquiry comes on the heels of a corruption scandal at engineering and telecommunications giant siemens in 2006 .
investigators found that siemens staff had set up slush funds to pay " commissions " to secure contracts .
the affair led to a major restructuring at siemens and the company later agreed to pay one billion euros in fines .
in 2007 , man responded to the siemens scandal by appointing two ombudsmen to accept tip-offs from whistle-blowers in the company and investigate possible breaches of corporate standards . th / pfd , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

countries have been talking for nearly a year in an attempt to hammer out an accord by this year 's international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- meeting .
but a draft report seen by bbc news admits the process has " fallen short " .
a source close to the talks blamed japan , saying it had not offered big enough cuts in its antarctic hunt , conducted in the name of research .
earlier meetings had raised the possibility that japan might countenance annual reductions in its catch over the next five years , perhaps down to zero .
however , the source said that at a meeting held last month in san francisco , japan had offered to cut the haul to 650 minke whales per year , only 29 fewer than were caught last season .
this , the source said , " killed any prospect of agreement in madeira " - the location for this year 's iwc meeting , which takes place next month .
in return for downscaling its annual scientific hunt , japan has been seeking a small annual quota for four coastal communities which , it says , have whaling as an important part of their cultural background . "
it should not come as a surprise that it has thus far not been possible to secure agreement " report seen by the bbc on iwc working group ' peace talks ' this has drawn the ire of many environment groups , which say it would effectively contravene the 1982 global moratorium on commercial whaling .
the working group that has been discussing the proposed deal will ask the iwc 's scientific committee to investigate how quotas for such " small-type coastal whaling " might be regulated .
japan is seeking a quota of 150 minke whales per year .
' right spirit ' informal discussions on the " peace process " started two years ago , and the formal process was instigated at last year 's iwc meeting in santiago .
the legalities of whaling under the global moratorium on commercial whaling , hunting is conducted in three ways : objection - a country formally objects to the iwc moratorium , declaring itself exempt .
example : norway scientific - a nation issues unilateral ' scientific permits ' ; any iwc member can do this .
example : japan aboriginal - iwc grants permits to indigenous groups for subsistence food .
example : alaskan inupiat led by the us chairman , william hogarth , the iwc established a small working group of countries to pursue discussions over the year .
the idea was to find a " package " of reforms that all sides could live with .
its report is due for publication on 18 may .
the draft seen by bbc news says that given the complexities and the sensitivities , " it should not come as a surprise that it has thus far not been possible to secure agreement " on the key issues - scientific hunting , small-type coastal whaling and whale sanctuaries .
but , it says , " significant concrete results " have emerged from the process , citing " the greatly improved atmosphere and the spirit of respectful dialogue " .
' nothing special ' conservation groups have been divided on the merits of the process .
some are opposed to any deal that would allow commercial hunting , on however limited a scale .
they are also concerned that other countries may seek to engage in small-type coastal whaling if the category were established .
a south korean newspaper recently reported that the seoul government would pursue such a request .
other conservation groups have backed the process as something that could reduce the overall annual catch - now numbering about 2,000 - of species under the iwc 's jurisdiction .
the working group 's report suggests the process should continue for a further year , a notion that appears to command support in washington and tokyo .
last month , a meeting of 32 iwc member nations from the " pro-sustainable use " bloc , held in tokyo , agreed that the peace process should have their backing but , they declared , whales should not be placed in a special category of animals exempt from " sustainable use " .
they welcomed the recent trading of whale meat between iceland , norway and japan , and rejected the creation of whale sanctuaries - all of which place them at odds with the aims of anti-whaling countries .
the bbc 's source suggested these nations might feel the peace process was not worthwhile , if japan was not going to offer larger reductions in the annual antarctic catch .
for an agreement to happen , the source suggested , " another level of the japanese government " would have to be involved , rather than the fisheries agency which , critics say , benefits politically from the current situation .
the japanese government is likely to give its formal reaction after the report 's publication .

it should not come as a surprise that it has thus far not been possible to secure agreement report seen by the bbc on iwc working group ' peace talks ' this has drawn the ire of many environment groups , which say it would effectively contravene the 1982 global moratorium on commercial whaling .
the working group that has been discussing the proposed deal will ask the iwc 's scientific committee to investigate how quotas for such " small-type coastal whaling " might be regulated .
japan is seeking a quota of 150 minke whales per year .
' right spirit ' informal discussions on the " peace process " started two years ago , and the formal process was instigated at last year 's iwc meeting in santiago .
the legalities of whaling under the global moratorium on commercial whaling , hunting is conducted in three ways : objection - a country formally objects to the iwc moratorium , declaring itself exempt .
example : norway scientific - a nation issues unilateral ' scientific permits ' ; any iwc member can do this .
example : japan aboriginal - iwc grants permits to indigenous groups for subsistence food .
example : alaskan inupiat led by the us chairman , william hogarth , the iwc established a small working group of countries to pursue discussions over the year .
the idea was to find a " package " of reforms that all sides could live with .
its report is due for publication on 18 may .
the draft seen by bbc news says that given the complexities and the sensitivities , " it should not come as a surprise that it has thus far not been possible to secure agreement " on the key issues - scientific hunting , small-type coastal whaling and whale sanctuaries .
but , it says , " significant concrete results " have emerged from the process , citing " the greatly improved atmosphere and the spirit of respectful dialogue " .
' nothing special ' conservation groups have been divided on the merits of the process .
some are opposed to any deal that would allow commercial hunting , on however limited a scale .
iceland and norway recently began exporting whale meat for sale in japan they are also concerned that other countries may seek to engage in small-type coastal whaling if the category were established .
a south korean newspaper recently reported that the seoul government would pursue such a request .
other conservation groups have backed the process as something that could reduce the overall annual catch - now numbering about 2,000 - of species under the iwc 's jurisdiction .
the working group 's report suggests the process should continue for a further year , a notion that appears to command support in washington and tokyo .
last month , a meeting of 32 iwc member nations from the " pro-sustainable use " bloc , held in tokyo , agreed that the peace process should have their backing but , they declared , whales should not be placed in a special category of animals exempt from " sustainable use " .
they welcomed the recent trading of whale meat between iceland , norway and japan , and rejected the creation of whale sanctuaries - all of which place them at odds with the aims of anti-whaling countries .
the bbc 's source suggested these nations might feel the peace process was not worthwhile , if japan was not going to offer larger reductions in the annual antarctic catch .
for an agreement to happen , the source suggested , " another level of the japanese government " would have to be involved , rather than the fisheries agency which , critics say , benefits politically from the current situation .
the japanese government is likely to give its formal reaction after the report 's publication .
