program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 20.07.2009 moon attracts renewed international scientific interest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detailed mapping will make the moon less mysterious forty years after the first manned landing , the moon is again getting a lot of scientific attention .
two teams of german scientists are contributing research to a nasa probe looking for suitable future landing sites . the lunar reconnaissance orbiter -lrb- lro -rrb- has successfully entered its orbit and made news around the world by sending images of traces left behind by the first human moon landing - the apollo 11 mission of 1969 - as well as other apollo missions .
the photos , which were taken by the probe 's camera , lroc , show scientific instruments and a trail of footprints in the lunar dust . the lro mission coincides with the indian moon mission launched in october 2008 and follows recent lunar ventures made by japan and china . " the moon is probably the single most important object for our understanding the entire solar system , " said harald hiesinger , a professor at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster .
" it allows us to look back into the very early phases of our solar system because major geological evolution stopped early on the moon .
it allows us to develop hypotheses and techniques that can be applied to other planets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lroc camera delivers more-detailed photos than previously seen launched on june 18 from the world space station at cape canaveral in florida , the lro is an unmanned space probe carrying seven high-tech instruments .
its main aims are to provide a more accurate map of the moon 's surface , locate suitable landings sites for future manned missions , and research details of the moon 's inner and outer structure .
the virtually unknown polar areas of the moon and the possibility of finding water ice in very deep craters are of particular interest to researchers who sent the probe . german scientists lend expertise the german aerospace center is supporting two groups of german researchers who are involved in interpreting and evaluating data sent by nasa 's lro probe , which will orbit the moon for at least one year at an altitude of 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the lro probe reaches its nominal orbit , full-scale research can begin professor harald hiesinger and his team at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster are focusing on data generated by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter camera -lrb- lroc -rrb- .
this camera , which consists of three separate cameras , is expected to provide very high-resolution images of the lunar surface : around half a meter per pixel . " this means that from our orbit we will see rocks and other features which are just one meter or less in size , " hiesinger said .
" this is an extremely high resolution which has n't been achieved on this scale before . " hiesinger 's team will assist in calibrating the images , as well as evaluating what the photos show .
they will also help to measure the age of different parts of the lunar surface by looking at the amount and size of craters left behind by meteorites and asteroids . lroc 's first images of the former apollo landing site have excited the scientists and hiesinger is pleased with the camera 's progress so far . berlin scientists involved in lola bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mission should pave the way for future human landings on the moon meanwhile , a team led by professor juergen oberst from the german aerospace center 's institute of planetary research in berlin and the technical university in berlin , is focusing on geophysical and geodetic data interpretation , mainly generated by the lunar orbiter laser altimeter -lrb- lola -rrb- . the data will give the scientists an idea about the interior structure of the moon as well as the topography of the lunar surface .
the altimeter will collect data by sending laser signals and measuring the time they need to return to the sensor after being reflected by a surface , mapping the shape and size of the moon 's natural features such as valleys and mountains . " the altimeter is working correctly so far , " said oberst , adding that like the other instruments onboard the lro probe , the altimeter is still in its testing phase .
" we are really looking forward to the regular mapping phase , where we will get continuous data from the altimeter for every orbit .
this should start within the next month . " author : eva wutke editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two teams of german scientists are contributing research to a nasa probe looking for suitable future landing sites . the lunar reconnaissance orbiter -lrb- lro -rrb- has successfully entered its orbit and made news around the world by sending images of traces left behind by the first human moon landing - the apollo 11 mission of 1969 - as well as other apollo missions .
the photos , which were taken by the probe 's camera , lroc , show scientific instruments and a trail of footprints in the lunar dust . the lro mission coincides with the indian moon mission launched in october 2008 and follows recent lunar ventures made by japan and china . " the moon is probably the single most important object for our understanding the entire solar system , " said harald hiesinger , a professor at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster .
" it allows us to look back into the very early phases of our solar system because major geological evolution stopped early on the moon .
it allows us to develop hypotheses and techniques that can be applied to other planets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lroc camera delivers more-detailed photos than previously seen launched on june 18 from the world space station at cape canaveral in florida , the lro is an unmanned space probe carrying seven high-tech instruments .
its main aims are to provide a more accurate map of the moon 's surface , locate suitable landings sites for future manned missions , and research details of the moon 's inner and outer structure .
the virtually unknown polar areas of the moon and the possibility of finding water ice in very deep craters are of particular interest to researchers who sent the probe . german scientists lend expertise the german aerospace center is supporting two groups of german researchers who are involved in interpreting and evaluating data sent by nasa 's lro probe , which will orbit the moon for at least one year at an altitude of 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the lro probe reaches its nominal orbit , full-scale research can begin professor harald hiesinger and his team at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster are focusing on data generated by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter camera -lrb- lroc -rrb- .
this camera , which consists of three separate cameras , is expected to provide very high-resolution images of the lunar surface : around half a meter per pixel . " this means that from our orbit we will see rocks and other features which are just one meter or less in size , " hiesinger said .
" this is an extremely high resolution which has n't been achieved on this scale before . " hiesinger 's team will assist in calibrating the images , as well as evaluating what the photos show .
they will also help to measure the age of different parts of the lunar surface by looking at the amount and size of craters left behind by meteorites and asteroids . lroc 's first images of the former apollo landing site have excited the scientists and hiesinger is pleased with the camera 's progress so far . berlin scientists involved in lola bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mission should pave the way for future human landings on the moon meanwhile , a team led by professor juergen oberst from the german aerospace center 's institute of planetary research in berlin and the technical university in berlin , is focusing on geophysical and geodetic data interpretation , mainly generated by the lunar orbiter laser altimeter -lrb- lola -rrb- . the data will give the scientists an idea about the interior structure of the moon as well as the topography of the lunar surface .
the altimeter will collect data by sending laser signals and measuring the time they need to return to the sensor after being reflected by a surface , mapping the shape and size of the moon 's natural features such as valleys and mountains . " the altimeter is working correctly so far , " said oberst , adding that like the other instruments onboard the lro probe , the altimeter is still in its testing phase .
" we are really looking forward to the regular mapping phase , where we will get continuous data from the altimeter for every orbit .

monday 's vote on dissolving the parliament failed , as it did n't achieve the required two-thirds majority .
the cdu initiated the motion but their spd coalition partners voted against it , having pledged to do so before the ballot .
now , the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen plans to initiate a vote of confidence in a final bid to dissolve the government .
curiously , this means the cdu will be voting against its own leadership and hoping that smaller parties in the region follow suit .
the regional leader for the social democrats , ralf stegner , had always opposed the motion to disband the coalition , accusing the cdu of political chicanery .
stegner , speaking to the berliner morgenpost daily paper , said the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen had deceived parliament .
" someone , who seeks to shatter the coalition , and who lies to the house , should n't think about dissolving parliament , rather , he should step down , " stegner said .
determined to split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleswig-holstein 's battle is about to be repeated on a national level after the spd blocked the vote to dissolve parliament , carstensen said his rivals had " left -lsb- him -rsb- no other choice " but to call for a vote of confidence on the current government .
he had already indicated he would be prepared to take this measure if necessary , saying stegner 's calls for his resignation had forced his hand .
chancellor angela merkel has supported carstensen throughout , and has called for a new election in schleswig-holstein .
she said the coalition in schleswig-holstein had never really pulled together , and blamed the social democrats for stifling progress .
merkel said that every other party in the state was in favor of reforming the government .
" that speaks for itself , and it 's also what should happen , " merkel said .
the dispute between the cdu and spd has taken on special significance so close to national elections in germany .
currently , the two parties rule in an uneasy coalition in berlin , but both sides are hoping to secure enough votes in september to be able to rule with smaller parties whose agendas are more similar to their own. msh / reuters / dpa / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the regional leader for the social democrats , ralf stegner , had always opposed the motion to disband the coalition , accusing the cdu of political chicanery .
stegner , speaking to the berliner morgenpost daily paper , said the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen had deceived parliament .
" someone , who seeks to shatter the coalition , and who lies to the house , should n't think about dissolving parliament , rather , he should step down , " stegner said .
determined to split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleswig-holstein 's battle is about to be repeated on a national level after the spd blocked the vote to dissolve parliament , carstensen said his rivals had " left -lsb- him -rsb- no other choice " but to call for a vote of confidence on the current government .
he had already indicated he would be prepared to take this measure if necessary , saying stegner 's calls for his resignation had forced his hand .
chancellor angela merkel has supported carstensen throughout , and has called for a new election in schleswig-holstein .
she said the coalition in schleswig-holstein had never really pulled together , and blamed the social democrats for stifling progress .
merkel said that every other party in the state was in favor of reforming the government .
" that speaks for itself , and it 's also what should happen , " merkel said .
the dispute between the cdu and spd has taken on special significance so close to national elections in germany .

general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .
magna teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and automaker gaz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the stakes - belgian investor rhj pledges to pay back state loans by 2014 but the deal is far from done and dusted .
brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .
the belgian investor will not pay out any dividends to shareholders before 2014 and has projected net sales to increase to 23.6 billion by 2014 with profits up to 2.5 billion by the same date .
trade union leaders have signaled their support for the magna deal , with opel union leader klaus franz criticizing the rhj plan as " a riddle wrapped up in an enigma " .
he said it was unclear how the belgian-based investor planned to finance the takeover .
" what we need is a proper industrial partner with an interest in long-term business and the future of the company , " franz told reuters news agency .
guttenberg told journalists that it was important to create a competitive company that could tackle consolidation measures .
he rejected a buyback option by opel 's american parent .
" that is not compatible with our ideas and should not happen , " said the german minister .
chinese suitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has moved a step closer to becoming the world 's biggest auto market beijing automotive -lrb- baic -rrb- is also pursuing opel , but merkel 's spokesman said on friday talks with the chinese group were not as advanced .
baic wants to invest 660 million euros for a 51 percent stake in opel and plans total investments of 1.59 billion euros by 2015 to build and sell opel vehicles in china .
the state-owned chinese car maker would cut 3,000 jobs in germany .
but roland koch , the regional premier of hesse , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that opel can not be run by a company that " produces 12,000 cars a year and does not even have the backing of the chinese government " .
meanwhile german car dealers have signalled their readiness to buy a stake in opel within the framework of the european dealers ' association .
the chairman of the german opel dealers association , kurt kroeger , told the rheinische post newspaper that it offered to invest 350-500 million euros , equivalent to a 10 percent stake in opel , by contributing 150 euros for every car sold .
in return the dealership association called for a bigger say in opel 's production policy. nrt / reuters / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the stakes - belgian investor rhj pledges to pay back state loans by 2014 but the deal is far from done and dusted .
brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .
the belgian investor will not pay out any dividends to shareholders before 2014 and has projected net sales to increase to 23.6 billion by 2014 with profits up to 2.5 billion by the same date .
trade union leaders have signaled their support for the magna deal , with opel union leader klaus franz criticizing the rhj plan as " a riddle wrapped up in an enigma " .
he said it was unclear how the belgian-based investor planned to finance the takeover .
" what we need is a proper industrial partner with an interest in long-term business and the future of the company , " franz told reuters news agency .
guttenberg told journalists that it was important to create a competitive company that could tackle consolidation measures .
he rejected a buyback option by opel 's american parent .

general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .

general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .
magna teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and automaker gaz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the stakes - belgian investor rhj pledges to pay back state loans by 2014 but the deal is far from done and dusted .
brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .
the belgian investor will not pay out any dividends to shareholders before 2014 and has projected net sales to increase to 23.6 billion by 2014 with profits up to 2.5 billion by the same date .
trade union leaders have signaled their support for the magna deal , with opel union leader klaus franz criticizing the rhj plan as " a riddle wrapped up in an enigma " .
he said it was unclear how the belgian-based investor planned to finance the takeover .
" what we need is a proper industrial partner with an interest in long-term business and the future of the company , " franz told reuters news agency .
guttenberg told journalists that it was important to create a competitive company that could tackle consolidation measures .
he rejected a buyback option by opel 's american parent .
" that is not compatible with our ideas and should not happen , " said the german minister .
chinese suitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has moved a step closer to becoming the world 's biggest auto market beijing automotive -lrb- baic -rrb- is also pursuing opel , but merkel 's spokesman said on friday talks with the chinese group were not as advanced .
baic wants to invest 660 million euros for a 51 percent stake in opel and plans total investments of 1.59 billion euros by 2015 to build and sell opel vehicles in china .
the state-owned chinese car maker would cut 3,000 jobs in germany .
but roland koch , the regional premier of hesse , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that opel can not be run by a company that " produces 12,000 cars a year and does not even have the backing of the chinese government " .
meanwhile german car dealers have signalled their readiness to buy a stake in opel within the framework of the european dealers ' association .
the chairman of the german opel dealers association , kurt kroeger , told the rheinische post newspaper that it offered to invest 350-500 million euros , equivalent to a 10 percent stake in opel , by contributing 150 euros for every car sold .
in return the dealership association called for a bigger say in opel 's production policy. nrt / reuters / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the national statistics office destatis , which published the findings , said that if changing energy prices were taken into account , then the drop would have been a more modest 2.8 percent on the year .
the cost of energy this june was 8.4 percent lower than in 2008 .

in june the average producer price dropped by 4.6 percent compared to 2008 . the 4.6 percent decline in the cost of goods at the factory gate is far worse than the may decrease of 3.6 percent .
it 's also a sharper drop than widely expected , marking the strongest year-on-year decline since 1968 .
however , on a monthly basis , producer prices only dropped by 0.1 percent .
the figures can be partially explained by energy prices , which were especially high in june 2008 .
the national statistics office destatis , which published the findings , said that if changing energy prices were taken into account , then the drop would have been a more modest 2.8 percent on the year .
the cost of energy this june was 8.4 percent lower than in 2008 .
figures like these fuel concern of deflation within the 16-nation eurozone , where consumer prices fell for the first time on record in june .
as the world 's leading exporter , germany 's economy is particularly sensitive to the price of goods .
the country is in the midst of its worst recession since 1945 , in the first quarter of 2009 economic activity contracted by 3.8 percent compared to the previous quarter. msh / afpe / reuters editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" july 20 is a warning to the future , and not an annually recurring nostalgic event , " guttenberg said . later on monday , chancellor angela merkel and defence minister franz josef jung are to address around 400 young bundeswehr recruits taking their military oath in front of the reichstag building .

like many german professional military officers , colonel von stauffenberg had no doubt that the war was lost .
now was the time to act , and he believed that only an armistice could avoid more bloodshed and damage to germany . he and his co-conspirators tried to kill adolf hitler in order to start talks with the western allies for an end to world war ii .
he knew he was committing high treason under german law . on july 20 the same year , stauffenberg planted a bomb hidden in a briefcase in hitler 's wolfsschanze eastern headquarters in eastern prussia during a briefing . the bomb exploded but its impact was broken by a heavy table .
of the 24 people present , four died , but hitler received only minor injuries .
meanwhile , stauffenberg had already returned to berlin .
convinced that the dictator was dead , he put in motion the so-called operation valkyrie , a plan originally conceived by the german military to suppress a possible rebellion during world war ii which was adopted by the resistance plotters . but the plan failed when it emerged later that evening that hitler had survived the bomb attack .
among those sentenced to death with stauffenberg , were general friedrich olbricht , the head of the group , as well as albrecht mertz von quirnheim and werner von haeften . the core group of plotters was executed that night by firing squad in the courtyard of the bendler block , then the general army office of the army high command . dfm / db / dpa / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the island of cyprus has been divided since july 20 , 1974 , when turkish troops launched an invasion in response to a greek cypriot coup aimed at a union with greece .
despite a series of initiatives over the past 35 years , no deal for reunification has been reached .
current un-led negotiations - that began again last year after four years of stalemate - are seen by international observers as a last chance for resolution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the ledra street crossing in nicosia in april 2008 raised hopes of reconciliation and reunification of the divided island the most recent project aimed at reunifying cyprus was the annan plan in 2004 , initiated by then-un secretary general kofi annan . both the turkish and greek sides of the island took part in a referendum on annan 's proposal , but the greek-cypriots overwhelmingly rejected it . with turkey hoping to gain eu membership , it has an incentive to negotiate a settlement . the issue of cyprus has been one of the major stumbling blocks to moving forward with turkey 's eu accession talks , as the international community does not formally recognize turkey 's claim to northern cyprus .
and although cyprus is an eu member , only greek cypriots are subject to eu laws and benefits .
as part of its eu membership bid , turkey is expected to open its airports and ports to cypriot planes and ships .
however , hugh pope of the ngo international crisis group says that there is currently a feeling of resignation in the country . " there 's this feeling in ankara now that whatever we do , europe is not going to accept us .
look at chancellor merkel , look at sarkozy of france .
every occasion they have , they say ‘ we do not want turkey in the eu ' , " says pope .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cypriot president dimitris christofias , left , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , center , will resume talks on reunification in addition to the issue of reunification , cyprus and turkey are at odds over the island 's energy resources .
cyprus has complained to brussels and the un over " provocation " by turkish naval vessels trying to hinder oil exploration off its southern coast .
it has also said that it will not resume eu accession talks if turkey continues to act like a " neighborhood bully " .
" the energy chapter ca n't open when turkey tries to impede cyprus , an eu member state , from utilizing its own energy sources , " foreign minister marcos kyprianou told reporters .
turkey claims that exploration for mineral wealth excludes turkish cypriots from reaping any benefits , a claim greek cypriots deny .
turkey is regarded as an essential route for the eu if they are to lessen their dependence on russia for natural gas .
president demetris christofias and his turkish cypriot counterpart mehment ali talat are to resume face-to-face talks later this week. vj / afp / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

monday 's vote on dissolving the parliament failed , as it did n't achieve the required two-thirds majority .
the cdu initiated the motion but their spd coalition partners voted against it , having pledged to do so before the ballot .
now , the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen plans to initiate a vote of confidence in a final bid to dissolve the government .
curiously , this means the cdu will be voting against its own leadership and hoping that smaller parties in the region follow suit .
the regional leader for the social democrats , ralf stegner , had always opposed the motion to disband the coalition , accusing the cdu of political chicanery .
stegner , speaking to the berliner morgenpost daily paper , said the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen had deceived parliament .
" someone , who seeks to shatter the coalition , and who lies to the house , should n't think about dissolving parliament , rather , he should step down , " stegner said .
determined to split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleswig-holstein 's battle is about to be repeated on a national level after the spd blocked the vote to dissolve parliament , carstensen said his rivals had " left -lsb- him -rsb- no other choice " but to call for a vote of confidence on the current government .
he had already indicated he would be prepared to take this measure if necessary , saying stegner 's calls for his resignation had forced his hand .
chancellor angela merkel has supported carstensen throughout , and has called for a new election in schleswig-holstein .
she said the coalition in schleswig-holstein had never really pulled together , and blamed the social democrats for stifling progress .
merkel said that every other party in the state was in favor of reforming the government .
" that speaks for itself , and it 's also what should happen , " merkel said .
the dispute between the cdu and spd has taken on special significance so close to national elections in germany .
currently , the two parties rule in an uneasy coalition in berlin , but both sides are hoping to secure enough votes in september to be able to rule with smaller parties whose agendas are more similar to their own. msh / reuters / dpa / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two teams of german scientists are contributing research to a nasa probe looking for suitable future landing sites . the lunar reconnaissance orbiter -lrb- lro -rrb- has successfully entered its orbit and made news around the world by sending images of traces left behind by the first human moon landing - the apollo 11 mission of 1969 - as well as other apollo missions .
the photos , which were taken by the probe 's camera , lroc , show scientific instruments and a trail of footprints in the lunar dust . the lro mission coincides with the indian moon mission launched in october 2008 and follows recent lunar ventures made by japan and china . " the moon is probably the single most important object for our understanding the entire solar system , " said harald hiesinger , a professor at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster .

this camera , which consists of three separate cameras , is expected to provide very high-resolution images of the lunar surface : around half a meter per pixel . " this means that from our orbit we will see rocks and other features which are just one meter or less in size , " hiesinger said .
" this is an extremely high resolution which has n't been achieved on this scale before . " hiesinger 's team will assist in calibrating the images , as well as evaluating what the photos show .
they will also help to measure the age of different parts of the lunar surface by looking at the amount and size of craters left behind by meteorites and asteroids . lroc 's first images of the former apollo landing site have excited the scientists and hiesinger is pleased with the camera 's progress so far . berlin scientists involved in lola bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mission should pave the way for future human landings on the moon meanwhile , a team led by professor juergen oberst from the german aerospace center 's institute of planetary research in berlin and the technical university in berlin , is focusing on geophysical and geodetic data interpretation , mainly generated by the lunar orbiter laser altimeter -lrb- lola -rrb- . the data will give the scientists an idea about the interior structure of the moon as well as the topography of the lunar surface .
the altimeter will collect data by sending laser signals and measuring the time they need to return to the sensor after being reflected by a surface , mapping the shape and size of the moon 's natural features such as valleys and mountains .

the photos , which were taken by the probe 's camera , lroc , show scientific instruments and a trail of footprints in the lunar dust . the lro mission coincides with the indian moon mission launched in october 2008 and follows recent lunar ventures made by japan and china . " the moon is probably the single most important object for our understanding the entire solar system , " said harald hiesinger , a professor at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster .
" it allows us to look back into the very early phases of our solar system because major geological evolution stopped early on the moon .
it allows us to develop hypotheses and techniques that can be applied to other planets .

its main aims are to provide a more accurate map of the moon 's surface , locate suitable landings sites for future manned missions , and research details of the moon 's inner and outer structure .
the virtually unknown polar areas of the moon and the possibility of finding water ice in very deep craters are of particular interest to researchers who sent the probe . german scientists lend expertise the german aerospace center is supporting two groups of german researchers who are involved in interpreting and evaluating data sent by nasa 's lro probe , which will orbit the moon for at least one year at an altitude of 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the lro probe reaches its nominal orbit , full-scale research can begin professor harald hiesinger and his team at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster are focusing on data generated by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter camera -lrb- lroc -rrb- .
this camera , which consists of three separate cameras , is expected to provide very high-resolution images of the lunar surface : around half a meter per pixel . " this means that from our orbit we will see rocks and other features which are just one meter or less in size , " hiesinger said .
" this is an extremely high resolution which has n't been achieved on this scale before . " hiesinger 's team will assist in calibrating the images , as well as evaluating what the photos show .
they will also help to measure the age of different parts of the lunar surface by looking at the amount and size of craters left behind by meteorites and asteroids . lroc 's first images of the former apollo landing site have excited the scientists and hiesinger is pleased with the camera 's progress so far . berlin scientists involved in lola bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mission should pave the way for future human landings on the moon meanwhile , a team led by professor juergen oberst from the german aerospace center 's institute of planetary research in berlin and the technical university in berlin , is focusing on geophysical and geodetic data interpretation , mainly generated by the lunar orbiter laser altimeter -lrb- lola -rrb- . the data will give the scientists an idea about the interior structure of the moon as well as the topography of the lunar surface .
the altimeter will collect data by sending laser signals and measuring the time they need to return to the sensor after being reflected by a surface , mapping the shape and size of the moon 's natural features such as valleys and mountains . " the altimeter is working correctly so far , " said oberst , adding that like the other instruments onboard the lro probe , the altimeter is still in its testing phase .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 20.07.2009 germany wants more money for struggling german car maker opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new dawn for gm 's european subsidiary ?
general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .

brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .
the belgian investor will not pay out any dividends to shareholders before 2014 and has projected net sales to increase to 23.6 billion by 2014 with profits up to 2.5 billion by the same date .
trade union leaders have signaled their support for the magna deal , with opel union leader klaus franz criticizing the rhj plan as " a riddle wrapped up in an enigma " .
he said it was unclear how the belgian-based investor planned to finance the takeover .
" what we need is a proper industrial partner with an interest in long-term business and the future of the company , " franz told reuters news agency .

general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .

general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .
magna teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and automaker gaz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the stakes - belgian investor rhj pledges to pay back state loans by 2014 but the deal is far from done and dusted .
brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .
the belgian investor will not pay out any dividends to shareholders before 2014 and has projected net sales to increase to 23.6 billion by 2014 with profits up to 2.5 billion by the same date .
trade union leaders have signaled their support for the magna deal , with opel union leader klaus franz criticizing the rhj plan as " a riddle wrapped up in an enigma " .
he said it was unclear how the belgian-based investor planned to finance the takeover .
" what we need is a proper industrial partner with an interest in long-term business and the future of the company , " franz told reuters news agency .
guttenberg told journalists that it was important to create a competitive company that could tackle consolidation measures .
he rejected a buyback option by opel 's american parent .
" that is not compatible with our ideas and should not happen , " said the german minister .

baic wants to invest 660 million euros for a 51 percent stake in opel and plans total investments of 1.59 billion euros by 2015 to build and sell opel vehicles in china .
the state-owned chinese car maker would cut 3,000 jobs in germany .
but roland koch , the regional premier of hesse , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that opel can not be run by a company that " produces 12,000 cars a year and does not even have the backing of the chinese government " .
meanwhile german car dealers have signalled their readiness to buy a stake in opel within the framework of the european dealers ' association .
the chairman of the german opel dealers association , kurt kroeger , told the rheinische post newspaper that it offered to invest 350-500 million euros , equivalent to a 10 percent stake in opel , by contributing 150 euros for every car sold .
in return the dealership association called for a bigger say in opel 's production policy. nrt / reuters / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the island of cyprus has been divided since july 20 , 1974 , when turkish troops launched an invasion in response to a greek cypriot coup aimed at a union with greece .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 20.07.2009 moon attracts renewed international scientific interest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detailed mapping will make the moon less mysterious forty years after the first manned landing , the moon is again getting a lot of scientific attention .
two teams of german scientists are contributing research to a nasa probe looking for suitable future landing sites . the lunar reconnaissance orbiter -lrb- lro -rrb- has successfully entered its orbit and made news around the world by sending images of traces left behind by the first human moon landing - the apollo 11 mission of 1969 - as well as other apollo missions .
the photos , which were taken by the probe 's camera , lroc , show scientific instruments and a trail of footprints in the lunar dust . the lro mission coincides with the indian moon mission launched in october 2008 and follows recent lunar ventures made by japan and china . " the moon is probably the single most important object for our understanding the entire solar system , " said harald hiesinger , a professor at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster .
" it allows us to look back into the very early phases of our solar system because major geological evolution stopped early on the moon .
it allows us to develop hypotheses and techniques that can be applied to other planets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lroc camera delivers more-detailed photos than previously seen launched on june 18 from the world space station at cape canaveral in florida , the lro is an unmanned space probe carrying seven high-tech instruments .
its main aims are to provide a more accurate map of the moon 's surface , locate suitable landings sites for future manned missions , and research details of the moon 's inner and outer structure .
the virtually unknown polar areas of the moon and the possibility of finding water ice in very deep craters are of particular interest to researchers who sent the probe . german scientists lend expertise the german aerospace center is supporting two groups of german researchers who are involved in interpreting and evaluating data sent by nasa 's lro probe , which will orbit the moon for at least one year at an altitude of 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the lro probe reaches its nominal orbit , full-scale research can begin professor harald hiesinger and his team at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster are focusing on data generated by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter camera -lrb- lroc -rrb- .
this camera , which consists of three separate cameras , is expected to provide very high-resolution images of the lunar surface : around half a meter per pixel . " this means that from our orbit we will see rocks and other features which are just one meter or less in size , " hiesinger said .
" this is an extremely high resolution which has n't been achieved on this scale before . " hiesinger 's team will assist in calibrating the images , as well as evaluating what the photos show .
they will also help to measure the age of different parts of the lunar surface by looking at the amount and size of craters left behind by meteorites and asteroids . lroc 's first images of the former apollo landing site have excited the scientists and hiesinger is pleased with the camera 's progress so far . berlin scientists involved in lola bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mission should pave the way for future human landings on the moon meanwhile , a team led by professor juergen oberst from the german aerospace center 's institute of planetary research in berlin and the technical university in berlin , is focusing on geophysical and geodetic data interpretation , mainly generated by the lunar orbiter laser altimeter -lrb- lola -rrb- . the data will give the scientists an idea about the interior structure of the moon as well as the topography of the lunar surface .
the altimeter will collect data by sending laser signals and measuring the time they need to return to the sensor after being reflected by a surface , mapping the shape and size of the moon 's natural features such as valleys and mountains . " the altimeter is working correctly so far , " said oberst , adding that like the other instruments onboard the lro probe , the altimeter is still in its testing phase .
" we are really looking forward to the regular mapping phase , where we will get continuous data from the altimeter for every orbit .
this should start within the next month . " author : eva wutke editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

monday 's vote on dissolving the parliament failed , as it did n't achieve the required two-thirds majority .
the cdu initiated the motion but their spd coalition partners voted against it , having pledged to do so before the ballot .

the regional leader for the social democrats , ralf stegner , had always opposed the motion to disband the coalition , accusing the cdu of political chicanery .
stegner , speaking to the berliner morgenpost daily paper , said the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen had deceived parliament .

general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .
magna teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and automaker gaz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the stakes - belgian investor rhj pledges to pay back state loans by 2014 but the deal is far from done and dusted .
brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .
the belgian investor will not pay out any dividends to shareholders before 2014 and has projected net sales to increase to 23.6 billion by 2014 with profits up to 2.5 billion by the same date .
trade union leaders have signaled their support for the magna deal , with opel union leader klaus franz criticizing the rhj plan as " a riddle wrapped up in an enigma " .
he said it was unclear how the belgian-based investor planned to finance the takeover .
" what we need is a proper industrial partner with an interest in long-term business and the future of the company , " franz told reuters news agency .
guttenberg told journalists that it was important to create a competitive company that could tackle consolidation measures .
he rejected a buyback option by opel 's american parent .
" that is not compatible with our ideas and should not happen , " said the german minister .
chinese suitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has moved a step closer to becoming the world 's biggest auto market beijing automotive -lrb- baic -rrb- is also pursuing opel , but merkel 's spokesman said on friday talks with the chinese group were not as advanced .
baic wants to invest 660 million euros for a 51 percent stake in opel and plans total investments of 1.59 billion euros by 2015 to build and sell opel vehicles in china .
the state-owned chinese car maker would cut 3,000 jobs in germany .
but roland koch , the regional premier of hesse , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that opel can not be run by a company that " produces 12,000 cars a year and does not even have the backing of the chinese government " .
meanwhile german car dealers have signalled their readiness to buy a stake in opel within the framework of the european dealers ' association .
the chairman of the german opel dealers association , kurt kroeger , told the rheinische post newspaper that it offered to invest 350-500 million euros , equivalent to a 10 percent stake in opel , by contributing 150 euros for every car sold .
in return the dealership association called for a bigger say in opel 's production policy. nrt / reuters / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the island of cyprus has been divided since july 20 , 1974 , when turkish troops launched an invasion in response to a greek cypriot coup aimed at a union with greece .
despite a series of initiatives over the past 35 years , no deal for reunification has been reached .
current un-led negotiations - that began again last year after four years of stalemate - are seen by international observers as a last chance for resolution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the ledra street crossing in nicosia in april 2008 raised hopes of reconciliation and reunification of the divided island the most recent project aimed at reunifying cyprus was the annan plan in 2004 , initiated by then-un secretary general kofi annan . both the turkish and greek sides of the island took part in a referendum on annan 's proposal , but the greek-cypriots overwhelmingly rejected it . with turkey hoping to gain eu membership , it has an incentive to negotiate a settlement . the issue of cyprus has been one of the major stumbling blocks to moving forward with turkey 's eu accession talks , as the international community does not formally recognize turkey 's claim to northern cyprus .
and although cyprus is an eu member , only greek cypriots are subject to eu laws and benefits .
as part of its eu membership bid , turkey is expected to open its airports and ports to cypriot planes and ships .
however , hugh pope of the ngo international crisis group says that there is currently a feeling of resignation in the country . " there 's this feeling in ankara now that whatever we do , europe is not going to accept us .
look at chancellor merkel , look at sarkozy of france .

general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .
magna teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and automaker gaz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the stakes - belgian investor rhj pledges to pay back state loans by 2014 but the deal is far from done and dusted .
brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .
the belgian investor will not pay out any dividends to shareholders before 2014 and has projected net sales to increase to 23.6 billion by 2014 with profits up to 2.5 billion by the same date .
trade union leaders have signaled their support for the magna deal , with opel union leader klaus franz criticizing the rhj plan as " a riddle wrapped up in an enigma " .
he said it was unclear how the belgian-based investor planned to finance the takeover .
" what we need is a proper industrial partner with an interest in long-term business and the future of the company , " franz told reuters news agency .
guttenberg told journalists that it was important to create a competitive company that could tackle consolidation measures .
he rejected a buyback option by opel 's american parent .
" that is not compatible with our ideas and should not happen , " said the german minister .
chinese suitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has moved a step closer to becoming the world 's biggest auto market beijing automotive -lrb- baic -rrb- is also pursuing opel , but merkel 's spokesman said on friday talks with the chinese group were not as advanced .
baic wants to invest 660 million euros for a 51 percent stake in opel and plans total investments of 1.59 billion euros by 2015 to build and sell opel vehicles in china .
the state-owned chinese car maker would cut 3,000 jobs in germany .
but roland koch , the regional premier of hesse , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that opel can not be run by a company that " produces 12,000 cars a year and does not even have the backing of the chinese government " .
meanwhile german car dealers have signalled their readiness to buy a stake in opel within the framework of the european dealers ' association .
the chairman of the german opel dealers association , kurt kroeger , told the rheinische post newspaper that it offered to invest 350-500 million euros , equivalent to a 10 percent stake in opel , by contributing 150 euros for every car sold .
in return the dealership association called for a bigger say in opel 's production policy. nrt / reuters / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .
magna teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and automaker gaz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the stakes - belgian investor rhj pledges to pay back state loans by 2014 but the deal is far from done and dusted .
brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .
the belgian investor will not pay out any dividends to shareholders before 2014 and has projected net sales to increase to 23.6 billion by 2014 with profits up to 2.5 billion by the same date .
trade union leaders have signaled their support for the magna deal , with opel union leader klaus franz criticizing the rhj plan as " a riddle wrapped up in an enigma " .
he said it was unclear how the belgian-based investor planned to finance the takeover .
" what we need is a proper industrial partner with an interest in long-term business and the future of the company , " franz told reuters news agency .
guttenberg told journalists that it was important to create a competitive company that could tackle consolidation measures .
he rejected a buyback option by opel 's american parent .
" that is not compatible with our ideas and should not happen , " said the german minister .

baic wants to invest 660 million euros for a 51 percent stake in opel and plans total investments of 1.59 billion euros by 2015 to build and sell opel vehicles in china .
the state-owned chinese car maker would cut 3,000 jobs in germany .
but roland koch , the regional premier of hesse , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that opel can not be run by a company that " produces 12,000 cars a year and does not even have the backing of the chinese government " .
meanwhile german car dealers have signalled their readiness to buy a stake in opel within the framework of the european dealers ' association .
the chairman of the german opel dealers association , kurt kroeger , told the rheinische post newspaper that it offered to invest 350-500 million euros , equivalent to a 10 percent stake in opel , by contributing 150 euros for every car sold .

the security situation in honduras has been deteriorating since zelaya 's government was overthrown in a military coup on june 28 .
" in view of the circumstances , i have taken the difficult decision to suspend all budgetary support payments , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said in a statement .
" i strongly appeal to both parties to refrain from any action or declaration which might further escalate tension , thus making the prospect of a solution more difficult . "

two teams of german scientists are contributing research to a nasa probe looking for suitable future landing sites . the lunar reconnaissance orbiter -lrb- lro -rrb- has successfully entered its orbit and made news around the world by sending images of traces left behind by the first human moon landing - the apollo 11 mission of 1969 - as well as other apollo missions .
the photos , which were taken by the probe 's camera , lroc , show scientific instruments and a trail of footprints in the lunar dust . the lro mission coincides with the indian moon mission launched in october 2008 and follows recent lunar ventures made by japan and china . " the moon is probably the single most important object for our understanding the entire solar system , " said harald hiesinger , a professor at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster .
" it allows us to look back into the very early phases of our solar system because major geological evolution stopped early on the moon .

its main aims are to provide a more accurate map of the moon 's surface , locate suitable landings sites for future manned missions , and research details of the moon 's inner and outer structure .
the virtually unknown polar areas of the moon and the possibility of finding water ice in very deep craters are of particular interest to researchers who sent the probe . german scientists lend expertise the german aerospace center is supporting two groups of german researchers who are involved in interpreting and evaluating data sent by nasa 's lro probe , which will orbit the moon for at least one year at an altitude of 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the lro probe reaches its nominal orbit , full-scale research can begin professor harald hiesinger and his team at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster are focusing on data generated by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter camera -lrb- lroc -rrb- .
this camera , which consists of three separate cameras , is expected to provide very high-resolution images of the lunar surface : around half a meter per pixel . " this means that from our orbit we will see rocks and other features which are just one meter or less in size , " hiesinger said .
" this is an extremely high resolution which has n't been achieved on this scale before . " hiesinger 's team will assist in calibrating the images , as well as evaluating what the photos show .
they will also help to measure the age of different parts of the lunar surface by looking at the amount and size of craters left behind by meteorites and asteroids . lroc 's first images of the former apollo landing site have excited the scientists and hiesinger is pleased with the camera 's progress so far . berlin scientists involved in lola bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mission should pave the way for future human landings on the moon meanwhile , a team led by professor juergen oberst from the german aerospace center 's institute of planetary research in berlin and the technical university in berlin , is focusing on geophysical and geodetic data interpretation , mainly generated by the lunar orbiter laser altimeter -lrb- lola -rrb- . the data will give the scientists an idea about the interior structure of the moon as well as the topography of the lunar surface .
the altimeter will collect data by sending laser signals and measuring the time they need to return to the sensor after being reflected by a surface , mapping the shape and size of the moon 's natural features such as valleys and mountains . " the altimeter is working correctly so far , " said oberst , adding that like the other instruments onboard the lro probe , the altimeter is still in its testing phase .

two teams of german scientists are contributing research to a nasa probe looking for suitable future landing sites . the lunar reconnaissance orbiter -lrb- lro -rrb- has successfully entered its orbit and made news around the world by sending images of traces left behind by the first human moon landing - the apollo 11 mission of 1969 - as well as other apollo missions .
the photos , which were taken by the probe 's camera , lroc , show scientific instruments and a trail of footprints in the lunar dust . the lro mission coincides with the indian moon mission launched in october 2008 and follows recent lunar ventures made by japan and china . " the moon is probably the single most important object for our understanding the entire solar system , " said harald hiesinger , a professor at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster .
" it allows us to look back into the very early phases of our solar system because major geological evolution stopped early on the moon .
it allows us to develop hypotheses and techniques that can be applied to other planets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lroc camera delivers more-detailed photos than previously seen launched on june 18 from the world space station at cape canaveral in florida , the lro is an unmanned space probe carrying seven high-tech instruments .
its main aims are to provide a more accurate map of the moon 's surface , locate suitable landings sites for future manned missions , and research details of the moon 's inner and outer structure .
the virtually unknown polar areas of the moon and the possibility of finding water ice in very deep craters are of particular interest to researchers who sent the probe . german scientists lend expertise the german aerospace center is supporting two groups of german researchers who are involved in interpreting and evaluating data sent by nasa 's lro probe , which will orbit the moon for at least one year at an altitude of 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the lro probe reaches its nominal orbit , full-scale research can begin professor harald hiesinger and his team at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster are focusing on data generated by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter camera -lrb- lroc -rrb- .
this camera , which consists of three separate cameras , is expected to provide very high-resolution images of the lunar surface : around half a meter per pixel . " this means that from our orbit we will see rocks and other features which are just one meter or less in size , " hiesinger said .

" july 20 is a warning to the future , and not an annually recurring nostalgic event , " guttenberg said . later on monday , chancellor angela merkel and defence minister franz josef jung are to address around 400 young bundeswehr recruits taking their military oath in front of the reichstag building .
the ceremonial oath is taken annually on july 20 in commemoration of the failed assassination attempt . anti-military demonstrators seized the opportunity to protest against war at a rally on potsdam square , out of earshot of the parliament building .
police had previously banned them from marching through berlin 's tiergarten park . assassination plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an historic date and place for the bundeswehr soldiers ' swearing-in ceremony on june 6 , 1944 -lrb- d-day -rrb- , the allies had landed in france .
like many german professional military officers , colonel von stauffenberg had no doubt that the war was lost .
now was the time to act , and he believed that only an armistice could avoid more bloodshed and damage to germany . he and his co-conspirators tried to kill adolf hitler in order to start talks with the western allies for an end to world war ii .
he knew he was committing high treason under german law . on july 20 the same year , stauffenberg planted a bomb hidden in a briefcase in hitler 's wolfsschanze eastern headquarters in eastern prussia during a briefing . the bomb exploded but its impact was broken by a heavy table .
of the 24 people present , four died , but hitler received only minor injuries .
meanwhile , stauffenberg had already returned to berlin .
convinced that the dictator was dead , he put in motion the so-called operation valkyrie , a plan originally conceived by the german military to suppress a possible rebellion during world war ii which was adopted by the resistance plotters . but the plan failed when it emerged later that evening that hitler had survived the bomb attack .
among those sentenced to death with stauffenberg , were general friedrich olbricht , the head of the group , as well as albrecht mertz von quirnheim and werner von haeften . the core group of plotters was executed that night by firing squad in the courtyard of the bendler block , then the general army office of the army high command . dfm / db / dpa / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the island of cyprus has been divided since july 20 , 1974 , when turkish troops launched an invasion in response to a greek cypriot coup aimed at a union with greece .
despite a series of initiatives over the past 35 years , no deal for reunification has been reached .
current un-led negotiations - that began again last year after four years of stalemate - are seen by international observers as a last chance for resolution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the ledra street crossing in nicosia in april 2008 raised hopes of reconciliation and reunification of the divided island the most recent project aimed at reunifying cyprus was the annan plan in 2004 , initiated by then-un secretary general kofi annan . both the turkish and greek sides of the island took part in a referendum on annan 's proposal , but the greek-cypriots overwhelmingly rejected it . with turkey hoping to gain eu membership , it has an incentive to negotiate a settlement . the issue of cyprus has been one of the major stumbling blocks to moving forward with turkey 's eu accession talks , as the international community does not formally recognize turkey 's claim to northern cyprus .
and although cyprus is an eu member , only greek cypriots are subject to eu laws and benefits .
as part of its eu membership bid , turkey is expected to open its airports and ports to cypriot planes and ships .
however , hugh pope of the ngo international crisis group says that there is currently a feeling of resignation in the country . " there 's this feeling in ankara now that whatever we do , europe is not going to accept us .

cyprus has complained to brussels and the un over " provocation " by turkish naval vessels trying to hinder oil exploration off its southern coast .
it has also said that it will not resume eu accession talks if turkey continues to act like a " neighborhood bully " .
" the energy chapter ca n't open when turkey tries to impede cyprus , an eu member state , from utilizing its own energy sources , " foreign minister marcos kyprianou told reporters .
turkey claims that exploration for mineral wealth excludes turkish cypriots from reaping any benefits , a claim greek cypriots deny .
turkey is regarded as an essential route for the eu if they are to lessen their dependence on russia for natural gas .

general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .
magna teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and automaker gaz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the stakes - belgian investor rhj pledges to pay back state loans by 2014 but the deal is far from done and dusted .
brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .
the belgian investor will not pay out any dividends to shareholders before 2014 and has projected net sales to increase to 23.6 billion by 2014 with profits up to 2.5 billion by the same date .
trade union leaders have signaled their support for the magna deal , with opel union leader klaus franz criticizing the rhj plan as " a riddle wrapped up in an enigma " .
he said it was unclear how the belgian-based investor planned to finance the takeover .
" what we need is a proper industrial partner with an interest in long-term business and the future of the company , " franz told reuters news agency .
guttenberg told journalists that it was important to create a competitive company that could tackle consolidation measures .
he rejected a buyback option by opel 's american parent .
" that is not compatible with our ideas and should not happen , " said the german minister .
chinese suitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has moved a step closer to becoming the world 's biggest auto market beijing automotive -lrb- baic -rrb- is also pursuing opel , but merkel 's spokesman said on friday talks with the chinese group were not as advanced .
baic wants to invest 660 million euros for a 51 percent stake in opel and plans total investments of 1.59 billion euros by 2015 to build and sell opel vehicles in china .
the state-owned chinese car maker would cut 3,000 jobs in germany .
but roland koch , the regional premier of hesse , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that opel can not be run by a company that " produces 12,000 cars a year and does not even have the backing of the chinese government " .
meanwhile german car dealers have signalled their readiness to buy a stake in opel within the framework of the european dealers ' association .
the chairman of the german opel dealers association , kurt kroeger , told the rheinische post newspaper that it offered to invest 350-500 million euros , equivalent to a 10 percent stake in opel , by contributing 150 euros for every car sold .
in return the dealership association called for a bigger say in opel 's production policy. nrt / reuters / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .
magna teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and automaker gaz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the stakes - belgian investor rhj pledges to pay back state loans by 2014 but the deal is far from done and dusted .
brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .
the belgian investor will not pay out any dividends to shareholders before 2014 and has projected net sales to increase to 23.6 billion by 2014 with profits up to 2.5 billion by the same date .
trade union leaders have signaled their support for the magna deal , with opel union leader klaus franz criticizing the rhj plan as " a riddle wrapped up in an enigma " .
he said it was unclear how the belgian-based investor planned to finance the takeover .
" what we need is a proper industrial partner with an interest in long-term business and the future of the company , " franz told reuters news agency .
guttenberg told journalists that it was important to create a competitive company that could tackle consolidation measures .
he rejected a buyback option by opel 's american parent .
" that is not compatible with our ideas and should not happen , " said the german minister .
chinese suitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has moved a step closer to becoming the world 's biggest auto market beijing automotive -lrb- baic -rrb- is also pursuing opel , but merkel 's spokesman said on friday talks with the chinese group were not as advanced .
baic wants to invest 660 million euros for a 51 percent stake in opel and plans total investments of 1.59 billion euros by 2015 to build and sell opel vehicles in china .
the state-owned chinese car maker would cut 3,000 jobs in germany .
but roland koch , the regional premier of hesse , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that opel can not be run by a company that " produces 12,000 cars a year and does not even have the backing of the chinese government " .
meanwhile german car dealers have signalled their readiness to buy a stake in opel within the framework of the european dealers ' association .
the chairman of the german opel dealers association , kurt kroeger , told the rheinische post newspaper that it offered to invest 350-500 million euros , equivalent to a 10 percent stake in opel , by contributing 150 euros for every car sold .
in return the dealership association called for a bigger say in opel 's production policy. nrt / reuters / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the island of cyprus has been divided since july 20 , 1974 , when turkish troops launched an invasion in response to a greek cypriot coup aimed at a union with greece .
despite a series of initiatives over the past 35 years , no deal for reunification has been reached .
current un-led negotiations - that began again last year after four years of stalemate - are seen by international observers as a last chance for resolution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the ledra street crossing in nicosia in april 2008 raised hopes of reconciliation and reunification of the divided island the most recent project aimed at reunifying cyprus was the annan plan in 2004 , initiated by then-un secretary general kofi annan . both the turkish and greek sides of the island took part in a referendum on annan 's proposal , but the greek-cypriots overwhelmingly rejected it . with turkey hoping to gain eu membership , it has an incentive to negotiate a settlement . the issue of cyprus has been one of the major stumbling blocks to moving forward with turkey 's eu accession talks , as the international community does not formally recognize turkey 's claim to northern cyprus .
and although cyprus is an eu member , only greek cypriots are subject to eu laws and benefits .
as part of its eu membership bid , turkey is expected to open its airports and ports to cypriot planes and ships .

" july 20 is a warning to the future , and not an annually recurring nostalgic event , " guttenberg said . later on monday , chancellor angela merkel and defence minister franz josef jung are to address around 400 young bundeswehr recruits taking their military oath in front of the reichstag building .
the ceremonial oath is taken annually on july 20 in commemoration of the failed assassination attempt . anti-military demonstrators seized the opportunity to protest against war at a rally on potsdam square , out of earshot of the parliament building .
police had previously banned them from marching through berlin 's tiergarten park . assassination plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an historic date and place for the bundeswehr soldiers ' swearing-in ceremony on june 6 , 1944 -lrb- d-day -rrb- , the allies had landed in france .
like many german professional military officers , colonel von stauffenberg had no doubt that the war was lost .
now was the time to act , and he believed that only an armistice could avoid more bloodshed and damage to germany . he and his co-conspirators tried to kill adolf hitler in order to start talks with the western allies for an end to world war ii .
he knew he was committing high treason under german law . on july 20 the same year , stauffenberg planted a bomb hidden in a briefcase in hitler 's wolfsschanze eastern headquarters in eastern prussia during a briefing . the bomb exploded but its impact was broken by a heavy table .
of the 24 people present , four died , but hitler received only minor injuries .
meanwhile , stauffenberg had already returned to berlin .
convinced that the dictator was dead , he put in motion the so-called operation valkyrie , a plan originally conceived by the german military to suppress a possible rebellion during world war ii which was adopted by the resistance plotters . but the plan failed when it emerged later that evening that hitler had survived the bomb attack .
among those sentenced to death with stauffenberg , were general friedrich olbricht , the head of the group , as well as albrecht mertz von quirnheim and werner von haeften . the core group of plotters was executed that night by firing squad in the courtyard of the bendler block , then the general army office of the army high command . dfm / db / dpa / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

monday 's vote on dissolving the parliament failed , as it did n't achieve the required two-thirds majority .
the cdu initiated the motion but their spd coalition partners voted against it , having pledged to do so before the ballot .
now , the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen plans to initiate a vote of confidence in a final bid to dissolve the government .
curiously , this means the cdu will be voting against its own leadership and hoping that smaller parties in the region follow suit .
the regional leader for the social democrats , ralf stegner , had always opposed the motion to disband the coalition , accusing the cdu of political chicanery .
stegner , speaking to the berliner morgenpost daily paper , said the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen had deceived parliament .
" someone , who seeks to shatter the coalition , and who lies to the house , should n't think about dissolving parliament , rather , he should step down , " stegner said .

he had already indicated he would be prepared to take this measure if necessary , saying stegner 's calls for his resignation had forced his hand .
chancellor angela merkel has supported carstensen throughout , and has called for a new election in schleswig-holstein .
she said the coalition in schleswig-holstein had never really pulled together , and blamed the social democrats for stifling progress .
merkel said that every other party in the state was in favor of reforming the government .
" that speaks for itself , and it 's also what should happen , " merkel said .
the dispute between the cdu and spd has taken on special significance so close to national elections in germany .
currently , the two parties rule in an uneasy coalition in berlin , but both sides are hoping to secure enough votes in september to be able to rule with smaller parties whose agendas are more similar to their own. msh / reuters / dpa / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

monday 's vote on dissolving the parliament failed , as it did n't achieve the required two-thirds majority .
the cdu initiated the motion but their spd coalition partners voted against it , having pledged to do so before the ballot .
now , the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen plans to initiate a vote of confidence in a final bid to dissolve the government .
curiously , this means the cdu will be voting against its own leadership and hoping that smaller parties in the region follow suit .
the regional leader for the social democrats , ralf stegner , had always opposed the motion to disband the coalition , accusing the cdu of political chicanery .
stegner , speaking to the berliner morgenpost daily paper , said the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen had deceived parliament .
" someone , who seeks to shatter the coalition , and who lies to the house , should n't think about dissolving parliament , rather , he should step down , " stegner said .
determined to split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleswig-holstein 's battle is about to be repeated on a national level after the spd blocked the vote to dissolve parliament , carstensen said his rivals had " left -lsb- him -rsb- no other choice " but to call for a vote of confidence on the current government .
he had already indicated he would be prepared to take this measure if necessary , saying stegner 's calls for his resignation had forced his hand .
chancellor angela merkel has supported carstensen throughout , and has called for a new election in schleswig-holstein .
she said the coalition in schleswig-holstein had never really pulled together , and blamed the social democrats for stifling progress .
merkel said that every other party in the state was in favor of reforming the government .
" that speaks for itself , and it 's also what should happen , " merkel said .
the dispute between the cdu and spd has taken on special significance so close to national elections in germany .
currently , the two parties rule in an uneasy coalition in berlin , but both sides are hoping to secure enough votes in september to be able to rule with smaller parties whose agendas are more similar to their own. msh / reuters / dpa / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the island of cyprus has been divided since july 20 , 1974 , when turkish troops launched an invasion in response to a greek cypriot coup aimed at a union with greece .
despite a series of initiatives over the past 35 years , no deal for reunification has been reached .
current un-led negotiations - that began again last year after four years of stalemate - are seen by international observers as a last chance for resolution .

and although cyprus is an eu member , only greek cypriots are subject to eu laws and benefits .
as part of its eu membership bid , turkey is expected to open its airports and ports to cypriot planes and ships .
however , hugh pope of the ngo international crisis group says that there is currently a feeling of resignation in the country . " there 's this feeling in ankara now that whatever we do , europe is not going to accept us .

cyprus has complained to brussels and the un over " provocation " by turkish naval vessels trying to hinder oil exploration off its southern coast .
it has also said that it will not resume eu accession talks if turkey continues to act like a " neighborhood bully " .
" the energy chapter ca n't open when turkey tries to impede cyprus , an eu member state , from utilizing its own energy sources , " foreign minister marcos kyprianou told reporters .
turkey claims that exploration for mineral wealth excludes turkish cypriots from reaping any benefits , a claim greek cypriots deny .
turkey is regarded as an essential route for the eu if they are to lessen their dependence on russia for natural gas .

the island of cyprus has been divided since july 20 , 1974 , when turkish troops launched an invasion in response to a greek cypriot coup aimed at a union with greece .
despite a series of initiatives over the past 35 years , no deal for reunification has been reached .
current un-led negotiations - that began again last year after four years of stalemate - are seen by international observers as a last chance for resolution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the ledra street crossing in nicosia in april 2008 raised hopes of reconciliation and reunification of the divided island the most recent project aimed at reunifying cyprus was the annan plan in 2004 , initiated by then-un secretary general kofi annan . both the turkish and greek sides of the island took part in a referendum on annan 's proposal , but the greek-cypriots overwhelmingly rejected it . with turkey hoping to gain eu membership , it has an incentive to negotiate a settlement . the issue of cyprus has been one of the major stumbling blocks to moving forward with turkey 's eu accession talks , as the international community does not formally recognize turkey 's claim to northern cyprus .
and although cyprus is an eu member , only greek cypriots are subject to eu laws and benefits .
as part of its eu membership bid , turkey is expected to open its airports and ports to cypriot planes and ships .
however , hugh pope of the ngo international crisis group says that there is currently a feeling of resignation in the country . " there 's this feeling in ankara now that whatever we do , europe is not going to accept us .
look at chancellor merkel , look at sarkozy of france .
every occasion they have , they say ‘ we do not want turkey in the eu ' , " says pope .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cypriot president dimitris christofias , left , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , center , will resume talks on reunification in addition to the issue of reunification , cyprus and turkey are at odds over the island 's energy resources .
cyprus has complained to brussels and the un over " provocation " by turkish naval vessels trying to hinder oil exploration off its southern coast .
it has also said that it will not resume eu accession talks if turkey continues to act like a " neighborhood bully " .
" the energy chapter ca n't open when turkey tries to impede cyprus , an eu member state , from utilizing its own energy sources , " foreign minister marcos kyprianou told reporters .
turkey claims that exploration for mineral wealth excludes turkish cypriots from reaping any benefits , a claim greek cypriots deny .
turkey is regarded as an essential route for the eu if they are to lessen their dependence on russia for natural gas .
president demetris christofias and his turkish cypriot counterpart mehment ali talat are to resume face-to-face talks later this week. vj / afp / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the security situation in honduras has been deteriorating since zelaya 's government was overthrown in a military coup on june 28 .
" in view of the circumstances , i have taken the difficult decision to suspend all budgetary support payments , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said in a statement .
" i strongly appeal to both parties to refrain from any action or declaration which might further escalate tension , thus making the prospect of a solution more difficult . "
" this is a crisis honduras can ill afford , " she added .
the european commission had earmarked 65.5 million euros -lrb- $ 92.73 million -rrb- for budgetary support payments for the 2007-2010 period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa rica 's president oscar arias , center , was unable to broker a solution on sunday , representatives of honduras ' de facto government rejected a proposal by mediator and costa rican president oscar arias for zelaya to return as president in charge of a " reconciliation " government .
he is currently in exile in nicaragua .
arias , who has won a nobel peace prize for his conflict resolution efforts in central america , has warned that honduras is now on the brink of civil war .

two teams of german scientists are contributing research to a nasa probe looking for suitable future landing sites . the lunar reconnaissance orbiter -lrb- lro -rrb- has successfully entered its orbit and made news around the world by sending images of traces left behind by the first human moon landing - the apollo 11 mission of 1969 - as well as other apollo missions .
the photos , which were taken by the probe 's camera , lroc , show scientific instruments and a trail of footprints in the lunar dust . the lro mission coincides with the indian moon mission launched in october 2008 and follows recent lunar ventures made by japan and china . " the moon is probably the single most important object for our understanding the entire solar system , " said harald hiesinger , a professor at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster .
" it allows us to look back into the very early phases of our solar system because major geological evolution stopped early on the moon .
it allows us to develop hypotheses and techniques that can be applied to other planets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lroc camera delivers more-detailed photos than previously seen launched on june 18 from the world space station at cape canaveral in florida , the lro is an unmanned space probe carrying seven high-tech instruments .
its main aims are to provide a more accurate map of the moon 's surface , locate suitable landings sites for future manned missions , and research details of the moon 's inner and outer structure .
the virtually unknown polar areas of the moon and the possibility of finding water ice in very deep craters are of particular interest to researchers who sent the probe . german scientists lend expertise the german aerospace center is supporting two groups of german researchers who are involved in interpreting and evaluating data sent by nasa 's lro probe , which will orbit the moon for at least one year at an altitude of 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the lro probe reaches its nominal orbit , full-scale research can begin professor harald hiesinger and his team at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster are focusing on data generated by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter camera -lrb- lroc -rrb- .
this camera , which consists of three separate cameras , is expected to provide very high-resolution images of the lunar surface : around half a meter per pixel . " this means that from our orbit we will see rocks and other features which are just one meter or less in size , " hiesinger said .
" this is an extremely high resolution which has n't been achieved on this scale before . " hiesinger 's team will assist in calibrating the images , as well as evaluating what the photos show .
they will also help to measure the age of different parts of the lunar surface by looking at the amount and size of craters left behind by meteorites and asteroids . lroc 's first images of the former apollo landing site have excited the scientists and hiesinger is pleased with the camera 's progress so far . berlin scientists involved in lola bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mission should pave the way for future human landings on the moon meanwhile , a team led by professor juergen oberst from the german aerospace center 's institute of planetary research in berlin and the technical university in berlin , is focusing on geophysical and geodetic data interpretation , mainly generated by the lunar orbiter laser altimeter -lrb- lola -rrb- . the data will give the scientists an idea about the interior structure of the moon as well as the topography of the lunar surface .
the altimeter will collect data by sending laser signals and measuring the time they need to return to the sensor after being reflected by a surface , mapping the shape and size of the moon 's natural features such as valleys and mountains . " the altimeter is working correctly so far , " said oberst , adding that like the other instruments onboard the lro probe , the altimeter is still in its testing phase .

two teams of german scientists are contributing research to a nasa probe looking for suitable future landing sites . the lunar reconnaissance orbiter -lrb- lro -rrb- has successfully entered its orbit and made news around the world by sending images of traces left behind by the first human moon landing - the apollo 11 mission of 1969 - as well as other apollo missions .
the photos , which were taken by the probe 's camera , lroc , show scientific instruments and a trail of footprints in the lunar dust . the lro mission coincides with the indian moon mission launched in october 2008 and follows recent lunar ventures made by japan and china . " the moon is probably the single most important object for our understanding the entire solar system , " said harald hiesinger , a professor at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster .
" it allows us to look back into the very early phases of our solar system because major geological evolution stopped early on the moon .
it allows us to develop hypotheses and techniques that can be applied to other planets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lroc camera delivers more-detailed photos than previously seen launched on june 18 from the world space station at cape canaveral in florida , the lro is an unmanned space probe carrying seven high-tech instruments .
its main aims are to provide a more accurate map of the moon 's surface , locate suitable landings sites for future manned missions , and research details of the moon 's inner and outer structure .
the virtually unknown polar areas of the moon and the possibility of finding water ice in very deep craters are of particular interest to researchers who sent the probe . german scientists lend expertise the german aerospace center is supporting two groups of german researchers who are involved in interpreting and evaluating data sent by nasa 's lro probe , which will orbit the moon for at least one year at an altitude of 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the lro probe reaches its nominal orbit , full-scale research can begin professor harald hiesinger and his team at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster are focusing on data generated by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter camera -lrb- lroc -rrb- .
this camera , which consists of three separate cameras , is expected to provide very high-resolution images of the lunar surface : around half a meter per pixel . " this means that from our orbit we will see rocks and other features which are just one meter or less in size , " hiesinger said .
" this is an extremely high resolution which has n't been achieved on this scale before . " hiesinger 's team will assist in calibrating the images , as well as evaluating what the photos show .
they will also help to measure the age of different parts of the lunar surface by looking at the amount and size of craters left behind by meteorites and asteroids . lroc 's first images of the former apollo landing site have excited the scientists and hiesinger is pleased with the camera 's progress so far . berlin scientists involved in lola bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mission should pave the way for future human landings on the moon meanwhile , a team led by professor juergen oberst from the german aerospace center 's institute of planetary research in berlin and the technical university in berlin , is focusing on geophysical and geodetic data interpretation , mainly generated by the lunar orbiter laser altimeter -lrb- lola -rrb- . the data will give the scientists an idea about the interior structure of the moon as well as the topography of the lunar surface .
the altimeter will collect data by sending laser signals and measuring the time they need to return to the sensor after being reflected by a surface , mapping the shape and size of the moon 's natural features such as valleys and mountains . " the altimeter is working correctly so far , " said oberst , adding that like the other instruments onboard the lro probe , the altimeter is still in its testing phase .

monday 's vote on dissolving the parliament failed , as it did n't achieve the required two-thirds majority .
the cdu initiated the motion but their spd coalition partners voted against it , having pledged to do so before the ballot .
now , the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen plans to initiate a vote of confidence in a final bid to dissolve the government .
curiously , this means the cdu will be voting against its own leadership and hoping that smaller parties in the region follow suit .
the regional leader for the social democrats , ralf stegner , had always opposed the motion to disband the coalition , accusing the cdu of political chicanery .
stegner , speaking to the berliner morgenpost daily paper , said the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen had deceived parliament .
" someone , who seeks to shatter the coalition , and who lies to the house , should n't think about dissolving parliament , rather , he should step down , " stegner said .
determined to split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleswig-holstein 's battle is about to be repeated on a national level after the spd blocked the vote to dissolve parliament , carstensen said his rivals had " left -lsb- him -rsb- no other choice " but to call for a vote of confidence on the current government .
he had already indicated he would be prepared to take this measure if necessary , saying stegner 's calls for his resignation had forced his hand .
chancellor angela merkel has supported carstensen throughout , and has called for a new election in schleswig-holstein .
she said the coalition in schleswig-holstein had never really pulled together , and blamed the social democrats for stifling progress .
merkel said that every other party in the state was in favor of reforming the government .
" that speaks for itself , and it 's also what should happen , " merkel said .
the dispute between the cdu and spd has taken on special significance so close to national elections in germany .
currently , the two parties rule in an uneasy coalition in berlin , but both sides are hoping to secure enough votes in september to be able to rule with smaller parties whose agendas are more similar to their own. msh / reuters / dpa / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .
magna teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and automaker gaz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the stakes - belgian investor rhj pledges to pay back state loans by 2014 but the deal is far from done and dusted .
brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .
the belgian investor will not pay out any dividends to shareholders before 2014 and has projected net sales to increase to 23.6 billion by 2014 with profits up to 2.5 billion by the same date .
trade union leaders have signaled their support for the magna deal , with opel union leader klaus franz criticizing the rhj plan as " a riddle wrapped up in an enigma " .
he said it was unclear how the belgian-based investor planned to finance the takeover .
" what we need is a proper industrial partner with an interest in long-term business and the future of the company , " franz told reuters news agency .
guttenberg told journalists that it was important to create a competitive company that could tackle consolidation measures .
he rejected a buyback option by opel 's american parent .
" that is not compatible with our ideas and should not happen , " said the german minister .
chinese suitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has moved a step closer to becoming the world 's biggest auto market beijing automotive -lrb- baic -rrb- is also pursuing opel , but merkel 's spokesman said on friday talks with the chinese group were not as advanced .
baic wants to invest 660 million euros for a 51 percent stake in opel and plans total investments of 1.59 billion euros by 2015 to build and sell opel vehicles in china .
the state-owned chinese car maker would cut 3,000 jobs in germany .
but roland koch , the regional premier of hesse , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that opel can not be run by a company that " produces 12,000 cars a year and does not even have the backing of the chinese government " .
meanwhile german car dealers have signalled their readiness to buy a stake in opel within the framework of the european dealers ' association .
the chairman of the german opel dealers association , kurt kroeger , told the rheinische post newspaper that it offered to invest 350-500 million euros , equivalent to a 10 percent stake in opel , by contributing 150 euros for every car sold .
in return the dealership association called for a bigger say in opel 's production policy. nrt / reuters / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .
magna teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and automaker gaz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the stakes - belgian investor rhj pledges to pay back state loans by 2014 but the deal is far from done and dusted .
brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .

general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .
magna teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and automaker gaz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the stakes - belgian investor rhj pledges to pay back state loans by 2014 but the deal is far from done and dusted .
brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .
the belgian investor will not pay out any dividends to shareholders before 2014 and has projected net sales to increase to 23.6 billion by 2014 with profits up to 2.5 billion by the same date .
trade union leaders have signaled their support for the magna deal , with opel union leader klaus franz criticizing the rhj plan as " a riddle wrapped up in an enigma " .
he said it was unclear how the belgian-based investor planned to finance the takeover .
" what we need is a proper industrial partner with an interest in long-term business and the future of the company , " franz told reuters news agency .
guttenberg told journalists that it was important to create a competitive company that could tackle consolidation measures .
he rejected a buyback option by opel 's american parent .
" that is not compatible with our ideas and should not happen , " said the german minister .
chinese suitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has moved a step closer to becoming the world 's biggest auto market beijing automotive -lrb- baic -rrb- is also pursuing opel , but merkel 's spokesman said on friday talks with the chinese group were not as advanced .
baic wants to invest 660 million euros for a 51 percent stake in opel and plans total investments of 1.59 billion euros by 2015 to build and sell opel vehicles in china .
the state-owned chinese car maker would cut 3,000 jobs in germany .
but roland koch , the regional premier of hesse , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that opel can not be run by a company that " produces 12,000 cars a year and does not even have the backing of the chinese government " .
meanwhile german car dealers have signalled their readiness to buy a stake in opel within the framework of the european dealers ' association .
the chairman of the german opel dealers association , kurt kroeger , told the rheinische post newspaper that it offered to invest 350-500 million euros , equivalent to a 10 percent stake in opel , by contributing 150 euros for every car sold .
in return the dealership association called for a bigger say in opel 's production policy. nrt / reuters / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

monday 's vote on dissolving the parliament failed , as it did n't achieve the required two-thirds majority .
the cdu initiated the motion but their spd coalition partners voted against it , having pledged to do so before the ballot .
now , the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen plans to initiate a vote of confidence in a final bid to dissolve the government .
curiously , this means the cdu will be voting against its own leadership and hoping that smaller parties in the region follow suit .
the regional leader for the social democrats , ralf stegner , had always opposed the motion to disband the coalition , accusing the cdu of political chicanery .
stegner , speaking to the berliner morgenpost daily paper , said the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen had deceived parliament .
" someone , who seeks to shatter the coalition , and who lies to the house , should n't think about dissolving parliament , rather , he should step down , " stegner said .
determined to split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleswig-holstein 's battle is about to be repeated on a national level after the spd blocked the vote to dissolve parliament , carstensen said his rivals had " left -lsb- him -rsb- no other choice " but to call for a vote of confidence on the current government .
he had already indicated he would be prepared to take this measure if necessary , saying stegner 's calls for his resignation had forced his hand .
chancellor angela merkel has supported carstensen throughout , and has called for a new election in schleswig-holstein .
she said the coalition in schleswig-holstein had never really pulled together , and blamed the social democrats for stifling progress .
merkel said that every other party in the state was in favor of reforming the government .
" that speaks for itself , and it 's also what should happen , " merkel said .
the dispute between the cdu and spd has taken on special significance so close to national elections in germany .
currently , the two parties rule in an uneasy coalition in berlin , but both sides are hoping to secure enough votes in september to be able to rule with smaller parties whose agendas are more similar to their own. msh / reuters / dpa / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the island of cyprus has been divided since july 20 , 1974 , when turkish troops launched an invasion in response to a greek cypriot coup aimed at a union with greece .
despite a series of initiatives over the past 35 years , no deal for reunification has been reached .
current un-led negotiations - that began again last year after four years of stalemate - are seen by international observers as a last chance for resolution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the ledra street crossing in nicosia in april 2008 raised hopes of reconciliation and reunification of the divided island the most recent project aimed at reunifying cyprus was the annan plan in 2004 , initiated by then-un secretary general kofi annan . both the turkish and greek sides of the island took part in a referendum on annan 's proposal , but the greek-cypriots overwhelmingly rejected it . with turkey hoping to gain eu membership , it has an incentive to negotiate a settlement . the issue of cyprus has been one of the major stumbling blocks to moving forward with turkey 's eu accession talks , as the international community does not formally recognize turkey 's claim to northern cyprus .
and although cyprus is an eu member , only greek cypriots are subject to eu laws and benefits .
as part of its eu membership bid , turkey is expected to open its airports and ports to cypriot planes and ships .
however , hugh pope of the ngo international crisis group says that there is currently a feeling of resignation in the country . " there 's this feeling in ankara now that whatever we do , europe is not going to accept us .
look at chancellor merkel , look at sarkozy of france .
every occasion they have , they say ‘ we do not want turkey in the eu ' , " says pope .

two teams of german scientists are contributing research to a nasa probe looking for suitable future landing sites . the lunar reconnaissance orbiter -lrb- lro -rrb- has successfully entered its orbit and made news around the world by sending images of traces left behind by the first human moon landing - the apollo 11 mission of 1969 - as well as other apollo missions .
the photos , which were taken by the probe 's camera , lroc , show scientific instruments and a trail of footprints in the lunar dust . the lro mission coincides with the indian moon mission launched in october 2008 and follows recent lunar ventures made by japan and china . " the moon is probably the single most important object for our understanding the entire solar system , " said harald hiesinger , a professor at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster .
" it allows us to look back into the very early phases of our solar system because major geological evolution stopped early on the moon .
it allows us to develop hypotheses and techniques that can be applied to other planets .

the island of cyprus has been divided since july 20 , 1974 , when turkish troops launched an invasion in response to a greek cypriot coup aimed at a union with greece .
despite a series of initiatives over the past 35 years , no deal for reunification has been reached .
current un-led negotiations - that began again last year after four years of stalemate - are seen by international observers as a last chance for resolution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the ledra street crossing in nicosia in april 2008 raised hopes of reconciliation and reunification of the divided island the most recent project aimed at reunifying cyprus was the annan plan in 2004 , initiated by then-un secretary general kofi annan . both the turkish and greek sides of the island took part in a referendum on annan 's proposal , but the greek-cypriots overwhelmingly rejected it . with turkey hoping to gain eu membership , it has an incentive to negotiate a settlement . the issue of cyprus has been one of the major stumbling blocks to moving forward with turkey 's eu accession talks , as the international community does not formally recognize turkey 's claim to northern cyprus .
and although cyprus is an eu member , only greek cypriots are subject to eu laws and benefits .
as part of its eu membership bid , turkey is expected to open its airports and ports to cypriot planes and ships .
however , hugh pope of the ngo international crisis group says that there is currently a feeling of resignation in the country . " there 's this feeling in ankara now that whatever we do , europe is not going to accept us .
look at chancellor merkel , look at sarkozy of france .
every occasion they have , they say ‘ we do not want turkey in the eu ' , " says pope .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cypriot president dimitris christofias , left , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , center , will resume talks on reunification in addition to the issue of reunification , cyprus and turkey are at odds over the island 's energy resources .
cyprus has complained to brussels and the un over " provocation " by turkish naval vessels trying to hinder oil exploration off its southern coast .
it has also said that it will not resume eu accession talks if turkey continues to act like a " neighborhood bully " .
" the energy chapter ca n't open when turkey tries to impede cyprus , an eu member state , from utilizing its own energy sources , " foreign minister marcos kyprianou told reporters .
turkey claims that exploration for mineral wealth excludes turkish cypriots from reaping any benefits , a claim greek cypriots deny .
turkey is regarded as an essential route for the eu if they are to lessen their dependence on russia for natural gas .
president demetris christofias and his turkish cypriot counterpart mehment ali talat are to resume face-to-face talks later this week. vj / afp / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 20.07.2009 germany wants more money for struggling german car maker opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new dawn for gm 's european subsidiary ?
general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .

general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .

general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .
magna teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and automaker gaz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the stakes - belgian investor rhj pledges to pay back state loans by 2014 but the deal is far from done and dusted .
brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .
the belgian investor will not pay out any dividends to shareholders before 2014 and has projected net sales to increase to 23.6 billion by 2014 with profits up to 2.5 billion by the same date .
trade union leaders have signaled their support for the magna deal , with opel union leader klaus franz criticizing the rhj plan as " a riddle wrapped up in an enigma " .
he said it was unclear how the belgian-based investor planned to finance the takeover .
" what we need is a proper industrial partner with an interest in long-term business and the future of the company , " franz told reuters news agency .
guttenberg told journalists that it was important to create a competitive company that could tackle consolidation measures .
he rejected a buyback option by opel 's american parent .
" that is not compatible with our ideas and should not happen , " said the german minister .
chinese suitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has moved a step closer to becoming the world 's biggest auto market beijing automotive -lrb- baic -rrb- is also pursuing opel , but merkel 's spokesman said on friday talks with the chinese group were not as advanced .
baic wants to invest 660 million euros for a 51 percent stake in opel and plans total investments of 1.59 billion euros by 2015 to build and sell opel vehicles in china .
the state-owned chinese car maker would cut 3,000 jobs in germany .
but roland koch , the regional premier of hesse , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that opel can not be run by a company that " produces 12,000 cars a year and does not even have the backing of the chinese government " .
meanwhile german car dealers have signalled their readiness to buy a stake in opel within the framework of the european dealers ' association .
the chairman of the german opel dealers association , kurt kroeger , told the rheinische post newspaper that it offered to invest 350-500 million euros , equivalent to a 10 percent stake in opel , by contributing 150 euros for every car sold .
in return the dealership association called for a bigger say in opel 's production policy. nrt / reuters / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de rhj discusses opel bid with berlin although canadian-austrian auto-parts supplier magna appears to remain the frontrunner to acquire opel , a belgian holding company has also expressed interest in the german automaker .

monday 's vote on dissolving the parliament failed , as it did n't achieve the required two-thirds majority .
the cdu initiated the motion but their spd coalition partners voted against it , having pledged to do so before the ballot .
now , the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen plans to initiate a vote of confidence in a final bid to dissolve the government .
curiously , this means the cdu will be voting against its own leadership and hoping that smaller parties in the region follow suit .
the regional leader for the social democrats , ralf stegner , had always opposed the motion to disband the coalition , accusing the cdu of political chicanery .
stegner , speaking to the berliner morgenpost daily paper , said the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen had deceived parliament .
" someone , who seeks to shatter the coalition , and who lies to the house , should n't think about dissolving parliament , rather , he should step down , " stegner said .

monday 's vote on dissolving the parliament failed , as it did n't achieve the required two-thirds majority .

" july 20 is a warning to the future , and not an annually recurring nostalgic event , " guttenberg said . later on monday , chancellor angela merkel and defence minister franz josef jung are to address around 400 young bundeswehr recruits taking their military oath in front of the reichstag building .
the ceremonial oath is taken annually on july 20 in commemoration of the failed assassination attempt . anti-military demonstrators seized the opportunity to protest against war at a rally on potsdam square , out of earshot of the parliament building .

like many german professional military officers , colonel von stauffenberg had no doubt that the war was lost .
now was the time to act , and he believed that only an armistice could avoid more bloodshed and damage to germany . he and his co-conspirators tried to kill adolf hitler in order to start talks with the western allies for an end to world war ii .
he knew he was committing high treason under german law . on july 20 the same year , stauffenberg planted a bomb hidden in a briefcase in hitler 's wolfsschanze eastern headquarters in eastern prussia during a briefing . the bomb exploded but its impact was broken by a heavy table .
of the 24 people present , four died , but hitler received only minor injuries .
meanwhile , stauffenberg had already returned to berlin .
convinced that the dictator was dead , he put in motion the so-called operation valkyrie , a plan originally conceived by the german military to suppress a possible rebellion during world war ii which was adopted by the resistance plotters . but the plan failed when it emerged later that evening that hitler had survived the bomb attack .
among those sentenced to death with stauffenberg , were general friedrich olbricht , the head of the group , as well as albrecht mertz von quirnheim and werner von haeften . the core group of plotters was executed that night by firing squad in the courtyard of the bendler block , then the general army office of the army high command . dfm / db / dpa / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the island of cyprus has been divided since july 20 , 1974 , when turkish troops launched an invasion in response to a greek cypriot coup aimed at a union with greece .
despite a series of initiatives over the past 35 years , no deal for reunification has been reached .
current un-led negotiations - that began again last year after four years of stalemate - are seen by international observers as a last chance for resolution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the ledra street crossing in nicosia in april 2008 raised hopes of reconciliation and reunification of the divided island the most recent project aimed at reunifying cyprus was the annan plan in 2004 , initiated by then-un secretary general kofi annan . both the turkish and greek sides of the island took part in a referendum on annan 's proposal , but the greek-cypriots overwhelmingly rejected it . with turkey hoping to gain eu membership , it has an incentive to negotiate a settlement . the issue of cyprus has been one of the major stumbling blocks to moving forward with turkey 's eu accession talks , as the international community does not formally recognize turkey 's claim to northern cyprus .
and although cyprus is an eu member , only greek cypriots are subject to eu laws and benefits .
as part of its eu membership bid , turkey is expected to open its airports and ports to cypriot planes and ships .
however , hugh pope of the ngo international crisis group says that there is currently a feeling of resignation in the country . " there 's this feeling in ankara now that whatever we do , europe is not going to accept us .
look at chancellor merkel , look at sarkozy of france .
every occasion they have , they say ‘ we do not want turkey in the eu ' , " says pope .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cypriot president dimitris christofias , left , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , center , will resume talks on reunification in addition to the issue of reunification , cyprus and turkey are at odds over the island 's energy resources .
cyprus has complained to brussels and the un over " provocation " by turkish naval vessels trying to hinder oil exploration off its southern coast .
it has also said that it will not resume eu accession talks if turkey continues to act like a " neighborhood bully " .
" the energy chapter ca n't open when turkey tries to impede cyprus , an eu member state , from utilizing its own energy sources , " foreign minister marcos kyprianou told reporters .
turkey claims that exploration for mineral wealth excludes turkish cypriots from reaping any benefits , a claim greek cypriots deny .
turkey is regarded as an essential route for the eu if they are to lessen their dependence on russia for natural gas .
president demetris christofias and his turkish cypriot counterpart mehment ali talat are to resume face-to-face talks later this week. vj / afp / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two teams of german scientists are contributing research to a nasa probe looking for suitable future landing sites . the lunar reconnaissance orbiter -lrb- lro -rrb- has successfully entered its orbit and made news around the world by sending images of traces left behind by the first human moon landing - the apollo 11 mission of 1969 - as well as other apollo missions .
the photos , which were taken by the probe 's camera , lroc , show scientific instruments and a trail of footprints in the lunar dust . the lro mission coincides with the indian moon mission launched in october 2008 and follows recent lunar ventures made by japan and china . " the moon is probably the single most important object for our understanding the entire solar system , " said harald hiesinger , a professor at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster .
" it allows us to look back into the very early phases of our solar system because major geological evolution stopped early on the moon .
it allows us to develop hypotheses and techniques that can be applied to other planets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lroc camera delivers more-detailed photos than previously seen launched on june 18 from the world space station at cape canaveral in florida , the lro is an unmanned space probe carrying seven high-tech instruments .
its main aims are to provide a more accurate map of the moon 's surface , locate suitable landings sites for future manned missions , and research details of the moon 's inner and outer structure .
the virtually unknown polar areas of the moon and the possibility of finding water ice in very deep craters are of particular interest to researchers who sent the probe . german scientists lend expertise the german aerospace center is supporting two groups of german researchers who are involved in interpreting and evaluating data sent by nasa 's lro probe , which will orbit the moon for at least one year at an altitude of 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the lro probe reaches its nominal orbit , full-scale research can begin professor harald hiesinger and his team at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster are focusing on data generated by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter camera -lrb- lroc -rrb- .
this camera , which consists of three separate cameras , is expected to provide very high-resolution images of the lunar surface : around half a meter per pixel . " this means that from our orbit we will see rocks and other features which are just one meter or less in size , " hiesinger said .
" this is an extremely high resolution which has n't been achieved on this scale before . " hiesinger 's team will assist in calibrating the images , as well as evaluating what the photos show .
they will also help to measure the age of different parts of the lunar surface by looking at the amount and size of craters left behind by meteorites and asteroids . lroc 's first images of the former apollo landing site have excited the scientists and hiesinger is pleased with the camera 's progress so far . berlin scientists involved in lola bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mission should pave the way for future human landings on the moon meanwhile , a team led by professor juergen oberst from the german aerospace center 's institute of planetary research in berlin and the technical university in berlin , is focusing on geophysical and geodetic data interpretation , mainly generated by the lunar orbiter laser altimeter -lrb- lola -rrb- . the data will give the scientists an idea about the interior structure of the moon as well as the topography of the lunar surface .
the altimeter will collect data by sending laser signals and measuring the time they need to return to the sensor after being reflected by a surface , mapping the shape and size of the moon 's natural features such as valleys and mountains . " the altimeter is working correctly so far , " said oberst , adding that like the other instruments onboard the lro probe , the altimeter is still in its testing phase .

the security situation in honduras has been deteriorating since zelaya 's government was overthrown in a military coup on june 28 .
" in view of the circumstances , i have taken the difficult decision to suspend all budgetary support payments , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said in a statement .
" i strongly appeal to both parties to refrain from any action or declaration which might further escalate tension , thus making the prospect of a solution more difficult . "
" this is a crisis honduras can ill afford , " she added .
the european commission had earmarked 65.5 million euros -lrb- $ 92.73 million -rrb- for budgetary support payments for the 2007-2010 period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa rica 's president oscar arias , center , was unable to broker a solution on sunday , representatives of honduras ' de facto government rejected a proposal by mediator and costa rican president oscar arias for zelaya to return as president in charge of a " reconciliation " government .
he is currently in exile in nicaragua .
arias , who has won a nobel peace prize for his conflict resolution efforts in central america , has warned that honduras is now on the brink of civil war .
the eu has backed efforts by the organization of american states for a peaceful solution aimed at restoring constitutional order by reinstating zelaya. dc / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

monday 's vote on dissolving the parliament failed , as it did n't achieve the required two-thirds majority .
the cdu initiated the motion but their spd coalition partners voted against it , having pledged to do so before the ballot .
now , the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen plans to initiate a vote of confidence in a final bid to dissolve the government .
curiously , this means the cdu will be voting against its own leadership and hoping that smaller parties in the region follow suit .
the regional leader for the social democrats , ralf stegner , had always opposed the motion to disband the coalition , accusing the cdu of political chicanery .
stegner , speaking to the berliner morgenpost daily paper , said the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen had deceived parliament .
" someone , who seeks to shatter the coalition , and who lies to the house , should n't think about dissolving parliament , rather , he should step down , " stegner said .
determined to split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleswig-holstein 's battle is about to be repeated on a national level after the spd blocked the vote to dissolve parliament , carstensen said his rivals had " left -lsb- him -rsb- no other choice " but to call for a vote of confidence on the current government .
he had already indicated he would be prepared to take this measure if necessary , saying stegner 's calls for his resignation had forced his hand .
chancellor angela merkel has supported carstensen throughout , and has called for a new election in schleswig-holstein .
she said the coalition in schleswig-holstein had never really pulled together , and blamed the social democrats for stifling progress .
merkel said that every other party in the state was in favor of reforming the government .
" that speaks for itself , and it 's also what should happen , " merkel said .
the dispute between the cdu and spd has taken on special significance so close to national elections in germany .
currently , the two parties rule in an uneasy coalition in berlin , but both sides are hoping to secure enough votes in september to be able to rule with smaller parties whose agendas are more similar to their own. msh / reuters / dpa / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

monday 's vote on dissolving the parliament failed , as it did n't achieve the required two-thirds majority .
the cdu initiated the motion but their spd coalition partners voted against it , having pledged to do so before the ballot .
now , the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen plans to initiate a vote of confidence in a final bid to dissolve the government .
curiously , this means the cdu will be voting against its own leadership and hoping that smaller parties in the region follow suit .
the regional leader for the social democrats , ralf stegner , had always opposed the motion to disband the coalition , accusing the cdu of political chicanery .
stegner , speaking to the berliner morgenpost daily paper , said the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen had deceived parliament .
" someone , who seeks to shatter the coalition , and who lies to the house , should n't think about dissolving parliament , rather , he should step down , " stegner said .
determined to split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleswig-holstein 's battle is about to be repeated on a national level after the spd blocked the vote to dissolve parliament , carstensen said his rivals had " left -lsb- him -rsb- no other choice " but to call for a vote of confidence on the current government .
he had already indicated he would be prepared to take this measure if necessary , saying stegner 's calls for his resignation had forced his hand .
chancellor angela merkel has supported carstensen throughout , and has called for a new election in schleswig-holstein .
she said the coalition in schleswig-holstein had never really pulled together , and blamed the social democrats for stifling progress .
merkel said that every other party in the state was in favor of reforming the government .
" that speaks for itself , and it 's also what should happen , " merkel said .
the dispute between the cdu and spd has taken on special significance so close to national elections in germany .
currently , the two parties rule in an uneasy coalition in berlin , but both sides are hoping to secure enough votes in september to be able to rule with smaller parties whose agendas are more similar to their own. msh / reuters / dpa / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two teams of german scientists are contributing research to a nasa probe looking for suitable future landing sites . the lunar reconnaissance orbiter -lrb- lro -rrb- has successfully entered its orbit and made news around the world by sending images of traces left behind by the first human moon landing - the apollo 11 mission of 1969 - as well as other apollo missions .
the photos , which were taken by the probe 's camera , lroc , show scientific instruments and a trail of footprints in the lunar dust . the lro mission coincides with the indian moon mission launched in october 2008 and follows recent lunar ventures made by japan and china . " the moon is probably the single most important object for our understanding the entire solar system , " said harald hiesinger , a professor at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster .
" it allows us to look back into the very early phases of our solar system because major geological evolution stopped early on the moon .
it allows us to develop hypotheses and techniques that can be applied to other planets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lroc camera delivers more-detailed photos than previously seen launched on june 18 from the world space station at cape canaveral in florida , the lro is an unmanned space probe carrying seven high-tech instruments .
its main aims are to provide a more accurate map of the moon 's surface , locate suitable landings sites for future manned missions , and research details of the moon 's inner and outer structure .
the virtually unknown polar areas of the moon and the possibility of finding water ice in very deep craters are of particular interest to researchers who sent the probe . german scientists lend expertise the german aerospace center is supporting two groups of german researchers who are involved in interpreting and evaluating data sent by nasa 's lro probe , which will orbit the moon for at least one year at an altitude of 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the lro probe reaches its nominal orbit , full-scale research can begin professor harald hiesinger and his team at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster are focusing on data generated by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter camera -lrb- lroc -rrb- .
this camera , which consists of three separate cameras , is expected to provide very high-resolution images of the lunar surface : around half a meter per pixel . " this means that from our orbit we will see rocks and other features which are just one meter or less in size , " hiesinger said .
" this is an extremely high resolution which has n't been achieved on this scale before . " hiesinger 's team will assist in calibrating the images , as well as evaluating what the photos show .
they will also help to measure the age of different parts of the lunar surface by looking at the amount and size of craters left behind by meteorites and asteroids . lroc 's first images of the former apollo landing site have excited the scientists and hiesinger is pleased with the camera 's progress so far . berlin scientists involved in lola bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mission should pave the way for future human landings on the moon meanwhile , a team led by professor juergen oberst from the german aerospace center 's institute of planetary research in berlin and the technical university in berlin , is focusing on geophysical and geodetic data interpretation , mainly generated by the lunar orbiter laser altimeter -lrb- lola -rrb- . the data will give the scientists an idea about the interior structure of the moon as well as the topography of the lunar surface .
the altimeter will collect data by sending laser signals and measuring the time they need to return to the sensor after being reflected by a surface , mapping the shape and size of the moon 's natural features such as valleys and mountains . " the altimeter is working correctly so far , " said oberst , adding that like the other instruments onboard the lro probe , the altimeter is still in its testing phase .
" we are really looking forward to the regular mapping phase , where we will get continuous data from the altimeter for every orbit .
this should start within the next month . " author : eva wutke editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 20.07.2009 germany wants more money for struggling german car maker opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new dawn for gm 's european subsidiary ?
general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .
magna teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and automaker gaz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the stakes - belgian investor rhj pledges to pay back state loans by 2014 but the deal is far from done and dusted .
brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .
the belgian investor will not pay out any dividends to shareholders before 2014 and has projected net sales to increase to 23.6 billion by 2014 with profits up to 2.5 billion by the same date .
trade union leaders have signaled their support for the magna deal , with opel union leader klaus franz criticizing the rhj plan as " a riddle wrapped up in an enigma " .
he said it was unclear how the belgian-based investor planned to finance the takeover .
" what we need is a proper industrial partner with an interest in long-term business and the future of the company , " franz told reuters news agency .
guttenberg told journalists that it was important to create a competitive company that could tackle consolidation measures .
he rejected a buyback option by opel 's american parent .
" that is not compatible with our ideas and should not happen , " said the german minister .
chinese suitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has moved a step closer to becoming the world 's biggest auto market beijing automotive -lrb- baic -rrb- is also pursuing opel , but merkel 's spokesman said on friday talks with the chinese group were not as advanced .
baic wants to invest 660 million euros for a 51 percent stake in opel and plans total investments of 1.59 billion euros by 2015 to build and sell opel vehicles in china .
the state-owned chinese car maker would cut 3,000 jobs in germany .
but roland koch , the regional premier of hesse , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that opel can not be run by a company that " produces 12,000 cars a year and does not even have the backing of the chinese government " .
meanwhile german car dealers have signalled their readiness to buy a stake in opel within the framework of the european dealers ' association .
the chairman of the german opel dealers association , kurt kroeger , told the rheinische post newspaper that it offered to invest 350-500 million euros , equivalent to a 10 percent stake in opel , by contributing 150 euros for every car sold .
in return the dealership association called for a bigger say in opel 's production policy. nrt / reuters / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de rhj discusses opel bid with berlin although canadian-austrian auto-parts supplier magna appears to remain the frontrunner to acquire opel , a belgian holding company has also expressed interest in the german automaker .

general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .
magna teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and automaker gaz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the stakes - belgian investor rhj pledges to pay back state loans by 2014 but the deal is far from done and dusted .
brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .
the belgian investor will not pay out any dividends to shareholders before 2014 and has projected net sales to increase to 23.6 billion by 2014 with profits up to 2.5 billion by the same date .
trade union leaders have signaled their support for the magna deal , with opel union leader klaus franz criticizing the rhj plan as " a riddle wrapped up in an enigma " .
he said it was unclear how the belgian-based investor planned to finance the takeover .
" what we need is a proper industrial partner with an interest in long-term business and the future of the company , " franz told reuters news agency .
guttenberg told journalists that it was important to create a competitive company that could tackle consolidation measures .
he rejected a buyback option by opel 's american parent .
" that is not compatible with our ideas and should not happen , " said the german minister .
chinese suitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has moved a step closer to becoming the world 's biggest auto market beijing automotive -lrb- baic -rrb- is also pursuing opel , but merkel 's spokesman said on friday talks with the chinese group were not as advanced .
baic wants to invest 660 million euros for a 51 percent stake in opel and plans total investments of 1.59 billion euros by 2015 to build and sell opel vehicles in china .
the state-owned chinese car maker would cut 3,000 jobs in germany .
but roland koch , the regional premier of hesse , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that opel can not be run by a company that " produces 12,000 cars a year and does not even have the backing of the chinese government " .
meanwhile german car dealers have signalled their readiness to buy a stake in opel within the framework of the european dealers ' association .
the chairman of the german opel dealers association , kurt kroeger , told the rheinische post newspaper that it offered to invest 350-500 million euros , equivalent to a 10 percent stake in opel , by contributing 150 euros for every car sold .
in return the dealership association called for a bigger say in opel 's production policy. nrt / reuters / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .
magna teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and automaker gaz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the stakes - belgian investor rhj pledges to pay back state loans by 2014 but the deal is far from done and dusted .
brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .
the belgian investor will not pay out any dividends to shareholders before 2014 and has projected net sales to increase to 23.6 billion by 2014 with profits up to 2.5 billion by the same date .
trade union leaders have signaled their support for the magna deal , with opel union leader klaus franz criticizing the rhj plan as " a riddle wrapped up in an enigma " .
he said it was unclear how the belgian-based investor planned to finance the takeover .
" what we need is a proper industrial partner with an interest in long-term business and the future of the company , " franz told reuters news agency .
guttenberg told journalists that it was important to create a competitive company that could tackle consolidation measures .
he rejected a buyback option by opel 's american parent .
" that is not compatible with our ideas and should not happen , " said the german minister .
chinese suitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has moved a step closer to becoming the world 's biggest auto market beijing automotive -lrb- baic -rrb- is also pursuing opel , but merkel 's spokesman said on friday talks with the chinese group were not as advanced .
baic wants to invest 660 million euros for a 51 percent stake in opel and plans total investments of 1.59 billion euros by 2015 to build and sell opel vehicles in china .
the state-owned chinese car maker would cut 3,000 jobs in germany .
but roland koch , the regional premier of hesse , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that opel can not be run by a company that " produces 12,000 cars a year and does not even have the backing of the chinese government " .
meanwhile german car dealers have signalled their readiness to buy a stake in opel within the framework of the european dealers ' association .
the chairman of the german opel dealers association , kurt kroeger , told the rheinische post newspaper that it offered to invest 350-500 million euros , equivalent to a 10 percent stake in opel , by contributing 150 euros for every car sold .
in return the dealership association called for a bigger say in opel 's production policy. nrt / reuters / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

monday 's vote on dissolving the parliament failed , as it did n't achieve the required two-thirds majority .
the cdu initiated the motion but their spd coalition partners voted against it , having pledged to do so before the ballot .

the regional leader for the social democrats , ralf stegner , had always opposed the motion to disband the coalition , accusing the cdu of political chicanery .
stegner , speaking to the berliner morgenpost daily paper , said the cdu 's state premier peter harry carstensen had deceived parliament .
" someone , who seeks to shatter the coalition , and who lies to the house , should n't think about dissolving parliament , rather , he should step down , " stegner said .

he had already indicated he would be prepared to take this measure if necessary , saying stegner 's calls for his resignation had forced his hand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 20.07.2009 moon attracts renewed international scientific interest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detailed mapping will make the moon less mysterious forty years after the first manned landing , the moon is again getting a lot of scientific attention .
two teams of german scientists are contributing research to a nasa probe looking for suitable future landing sites . the lunar reconnaissance orbiter -lrb- lro -rrb- has successfully entered its orbit and made news around the world by sending images of traces left behind by the first human moon landing - the apollo 11 mission of 1969 - as well as other apollo missions .
the photos , which were taken by the probe 's camera , lroc , show scientific instruments and a trail of footprints in the lunar dust . the lro mission coincides with the indian moon mission launched in october 2008 and follows recent lunar ventures made by japan and china . " the moon is probably the single most important object for our understanding the entire solar system , " said harald hiesinger , a professor at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster .
" it allows us to look back into the very early phases of our solar system because major geological evolution stopped early on the moon .
it allows us to develop hypotheses and techniques that can be applied to other planets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lroc camera delivers more-detailed photos than previously seen launched on june 18 from the world space station at cape canaveral in florida , the lro is an unmanned space probe carrying seven high-tech instruments .
its main aims are to provide a more accurate map of the moon 's surface , locate suitable landings sites for future manned missions , and research details of the moon 's inner and outer structure .
the virtually unknown polar areas of the moon and the possibility of finding water ice in very deep craters are of particular interest to researchers who sent the probe . german scientists lend expertise the german aerospace center is supporting two groups of german researchers who are involved in interpreting and evaluating data sent by nasa 's lro probe , which will orbit the moon for at least one year at an altitude of 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the lro probe reaches its nominal orbit , full-scale research can begin professor harald hiesinger and his team at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster are focusing on data generated by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter camera -lrb- lroc -rrb- .
this camera , which consists of three separate cameras , is expected to provide very high-resolution images of the lunar surface : around half a meter per pixel . " this means that from our orbit we will see rocks and other features which are just one meter or less in size , " hiesinger said .
" this is an extremely high resolution which has n't been achieved on this scale before . " hiesinger 's team will assist in calibrating the images , as well as evaluating what the photos show .
they will also help to measure the age of different parts of the lunar surface by looking at the amount and size of craters left behind by meteorites and asteroids . lroc 's first images of the former apollo landing site have excited the scientists and hiesinger is pleased with the camera 's progress so far . berlin scientists involved in lola bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mission should pave the way for future human landings on the moon meanwhile , a team led by professor juergen oberst from the german aerospace center 's institute of planetary research in berlin and the technical university in berlin , is focusing on geophysical and geodetic data interpretation , mainly generated by the lunar orbiter laser altimeter -lrb- lola -rrb- . the data will give the scientists an idea about the interior structure of the moon as well as the topography of the lunar surface .
the altimeter will collect data by sending laser signals and measuring the time they need to return to the sensor after being reflected by a surface , mapping the shape and size of the moon 's natural features such as valleys and mountains . " the altimeter is working correctly so far , " said oberst , adding that like the other instruments onboard the lro probe , the altimeter is still in its testing phase .
" we are really looking forward to the regular mapping phase , where we will get continuous data from the altimeter for every orbit .
this should start within the next month . " author : eva wutke editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .
magna teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and automaker gaz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the stakes - belgian investor rhj pledges to pay back state loans by 2014 but the deal is far from done and dusted .
brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .
the belgian investor will not pay out any dividends to shareholders before 2014 and has projected net sales to increase to 23.6 billion by 2014 with profits up to 2.5 billion by the same date .
trade union leaders have signaled their support for the magna deal , with opel union leader klaus franz criticizing the rhj plan as " a riddle wrapped up in an enigma " .
he said it was unclear how the belgian-based investor planned to finance the takeover .
" what we need is a proper industrial partner with an interest in long-term business and the future of the company , " franz told reuters news agency .
guttenberg told journalists that it was important to create a competitive company that could tackle consolidation measures .
he rejected a buyback option by opel 's american parent .
" that is not compatible with our ideas and should not happen , " said the german minister .
chinese suitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has moved a step closer to becoming the world 's biggest auto market beijing automotive -lrb- baic -rrb- is also pursuing opel , but merkel 's spokesman said on friday talks with the chinese group were not as advanced .
baic wants to invest 660 million euros for a 51 percent stake in opel and plans total investments of 1.59 billion euros by 2015 to build and sell opel vehicles in china .
the state-owned chinese car maker would cut 3,000 jobs in germany .
but roland koch , the regional premier of hesse , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper that opel can not be run by a company that " produces 12,000 cars a year and does not even have the backing of the chinese government " .
meanwhile german car dealers have signalled their readiness to buy a stake in opel within the framework of the european dealers ' association .
the chairman of the german opel dealers association , kurt kroeger , told the rheinische post newspaper that it offered to invest 350-500 million euros , equivalent to a 10 percent stake in opel , by contributing 150 euros for every car sold .
in return the dealership association called for a bigger say in opel 's production policy. nrt / reuters / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

general motors has requested final offers for opel to be submitted by monday amid german government demands for more cash from bidders magna , rhj and china 's beijing automative industry company -lrb- baic -rrb- . after months of wrangling , the bid process for struggling german car maker is still wide open , according to economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg who refused to confirm that frontrunner magna still had the coalition government 's full backing .
" there are still lots of question marks ; for example , the bidders have to ensure that the new opel company can start with a strong capital base , " guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that means that the bidders have to be ready to take on more risk themselves .
otherwise the eu commission will not accept the rescue , " the minister told the paper in an interview .
gm favorites are canadian auto parts maker magna and the belgian investor rhj international but china 's baic is reportedly poised to make a last-ditch bid for the european unit , which also includes the uk 's vauxhall plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel was the first european car maker to seek government aid business performance opel has accrued losses totaling 1.861 billion euros -lrb- 2647 billion us dollars -rrb- from 2003 - 200 , according to a report in financial times deutschland newspaper .
in the last ten years the ruesselsheim-based adam opel company has recorded losses each year except for 2001 and 2002 .
during that period opel 's market share , based on government figures , plunged to 8.4 percent in 2008 , compared to 13.7 percent in 1999 .
car sales in the same period have been halved to around 187,000 , down from 522,000 in 1999 .
in the first six months of 2009 , opel sold 187,000 cars , which included 51,652 from the government-funded " cash-for-clunkers " scheme , a reward program for customers who trade in their old cars for new , environmentally friendly models .
this has resulted in a 26 percent increase in europe 's biggest car market in the first six months of this year .
but underscoring the crisis that engulfed the car industry over the last 12 months as a result of the global economic downturn , the brussels-based auto industry association acea said total new european car registrations dropped 11 per cent during the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 .
opel saw its performance deteriorate by almost 10 percent compared to may 2008 .
election issue against this backdrop , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has said it could offer opel 1.5 billion euros in the form of loan guarantees , including 500 million from the regional government of hesse .
but with a general election only ten weeks away , merkel has been criticized by the spd 's candidate for the chancellorship , frank-walter steinmeier , for describing the troubled automaker as " not systemically relevant " .
berlin agreed in late may to throw its weight behind a bid by canadian-austrian auto parts maker magna , which emerged as a frontrunner in the bid to win a majority stake in opel .
magna teamed up with state-owned russian bank sberbank and automaker gaz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the stakes - belgian investor rhj pledges to pay back state loans by 2014 but the deal is far from done and dusted .
brussels-based finance investor rhj international has found favor with the berlin government .
it has offered 275 million euros for a majority stake and hopes to pip magna at the winning post with its " project beam " offer . rhj 's chief executive leonhard fischer said it would cut a maximum of some 10,000 jobs at gm 's opel unit if it was successful in its bid .
" we will have to cut just under 10,000 jobs across europe - no more " , said fischer in an interview with the bild mass circulation daily .
rhj plans to shut down a plant in antwerp , belgium in 2010 and streamline operations at the car maker 's four german plants .
no plant closures are planned in germany under rhj 's plans .
the belgian investor will not pay out any dividends to shareholders before 2014 and has projected net sales to increase to 23.6 billion by 2014 with profits up to 2.5 billion by the same date .
trade union leaders have signaled their support for the magna deal , with opel union leader klaus franz criticizing the rhj plan as " a riddle wrapped up in an enigma " .
he said it was unclear how the belgian-based investor planned to finance the takeover .
" what we need is a proper industrial partner with an interest in long-term business and the future of the company , " franz told reuters news agency .
guttenberg told journalists that it was important to create a competitive company that could tackle consolidation measures .
he rejected a buyback option by opel 's american parent .
" that is not compatible with our ideas and should not happen , " said the german minister .
chinese suitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has moved a step closer to becoming the world 's biggest auto market beijing automotive -lrb- baic -rrb- is also pursuing opel , but merkel 's spokesman said on friday talks with the chinese group were not as advanced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 20.07.2009 moon attracts renewed international scientific interest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detailed mapping will make the moon less mysterious forty years after the first manned landing , the moon is again getting a lot of scientific attention .
two teams of german scientists are contributing research to a nasa probe looking for suitable future landing sites . the lunar reconnaissance orbiter -lrb- lro -rrb- has successfully entered its orbit and made news around the world by sending images of traces left behind by the first human moon landing - the apollo 11 mission of 1969 - as well as other apollo missions .
the photos , which were taken by the probe 's camera , lroc , show scientific instruments and a trail of footprints in the lunar dust . the lro mission coincides with the indian moon mission launched in october 2008 and follows recent lunar ventures made by japan and china . " the moon is probably the single most important object for our understanding the entire solar system , " said harald hiesinger , a professor at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster .
" it allows us to look back into the very early phases of our solar system because major geological evolution stopped early on the moon .
it allows us to develop hypotheses and techniques that can be applied to other planets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lroc camera delivers more-detailed photos than previously seen launched on june 18 from the world space station at cape canaveral in florida , the lro is an unmanned space probe carrying seven high-tech instruments .
its main aims are to provide a more accurate map of the moon 's surface , locate suitable landings sites for future manned missions , and research details of the moon 's inner and outer structure .
the virtually unknown polar areas of the moon and the possibility of finding water ice in very deep craters are of particular interest to researchers who sent the probe . german scientists lend expertise the german aerospace center is supporting two groups of german researchers who are involved in interpreting and evaluating data sent by nasa 's lro probe , which will orbit the moon for at least one year at an altitude of 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the lro probe reaches its nominal orbit , full-scale research can begin professor harald hiesinger and his team at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster are focusing on data generated by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter camera -lrb- lroc -rrb- .
this camera , which consists of three separate cameras , is expected to provide very high-resolution images of the lunar surface : around half a meter per pixel . " this means that from our orbit we will see rocks and other features which are just one meter or less in size , " hiesinger said .
" this is an extremely high resolution which has n't been achieved on this scale before . " hiesinger 's team will assist in calibrating the images , as well as evaluating what the photos show .
they will also help to measure the age of different parts of the lunar surface by looking at the amount and size of craters left behind by meteorites and asteroids . lroc 's first images of the former apollo landing site have excited the scientists and hiesinger is pleased with the camera 's progress so far . berlin scientists involved in lola bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mission should pave the way for future human landings on the moon meanwhile , a team led by professor juergen oberst from the german aerospace center 's institute of planetary research in berlin and the technical university in berlin , is focusing on geophysical and geodetic data interpretation , mainly generated by the lunar orbiter laser altimeter -lrb- lola -rrb- . the data will give the scientists an idea about the interior structure of the moon as well as the topography of the lunar surface .
the altimeter will collect data by sending laser signals and measuring the time they need to return to the sensor after being reflected by a surface , mapping the shape and size of the moon 's natural features such as valleys and mountains . " the altimeter is working correctly so far , " said oberst , adding that like the other instruments onboard the lro probe , the altimeter is still in its testing phase .
" we are really looking forward to the regular mapping phase , where we will get continuous data from the altimeter for every orbit .
this should start within the next month . " author : eva wutke editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two teams of german scientists are contributing research to a nasa probe looking for suitable future landing sites . the lunar reconnaissance orbiter -lrb- lro -rrb- has successfully entered its orbit and made news around the world by sending images of traces left behind by the first human moon landing - the apollo 11 mission of 1969 - as well as other apollo missions .
the photos , which were taken by the probe 's camera , lroc , show scientific instruments and a trail of footprints in the lunar dust . the lro mission coincides with the indian moon mission launched in october 2008 and follows recent lunar ventures made by japan and china . " the moon is probably the single most important object for our understanding the entire solar system , " said harald hiesinger , a professor at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster .
" it allows us to look back into the very early phases of our solar system because major geological evolution stopped early on the moon .
it allows us to develop hypotheses and techniques that can be applied to other planets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lroc camera delivers more-detailed photos than previously seen launched on june 18 from the world space station at cape canaveral in florida , the lro is an unmanned space probe carrying seven high-tech instruments .
its main aims are to provide a more accurate map of the moon 's surface , locate suitable landings sites for future manned missions , and research details of the moon 's inner and outer structure .
the virtually unknown polar areas of the moon and the possibility of finding water ice in very deep craters are of particular interest to researchers who sent the probe . german scientists lend expertise the german aerospace center is supporting two groups of german researchers who are involved in interpreting and evaluating data sent by nasa 's lro probe , which will orbit the moon for at least one year at an altitude of 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the lro probe reaches its nominal orbit , full-scale research can begin professor harald hiesinger and his team at the institute for planetology at the westphalian wilhelm university in muenster are focusing on data generated by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter camera -lrb- lroc -rrb- .
this camera , which consists of three separate cameras , is expected to provide very high-resolution images of the lunar surface : around half a meter per pixel . " this means that from our orbit we will see rocks and other features which are just one meter or less in size , " hiesinger said .
" this is an extremely high resolution which has n't been achieved on this scale before . " hiesinger 's team will assist in calibrating the images , as well as evaluating what the photos show .
they will also help to measure the age of different parts of the lunar surface by looking at the amount and size of craters left behind by meteorites and asteroids . lroc 's first images of the former apollo landing site have excited the scientists and hiesinger is pleased with the camera 's progress so far . berlin scientists involved in lola bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mission should pave the way for future human landings on the moon meanwhile , a team led by professor juergen oberst from the german aerospace center 's institute of planetary research in berlin and the technical university in berlin , is focusing on geophysical and geodetic data interpretation , mainly generated by the lunar orbiter laser altimeter -lrb- lola -rrb- . the data will give the scientists an idea about the interior structure of the moon as well as the topography of the lunar surface .
the altimeter will collect data by sending laser signals and measuring the time they need to return to the sensor after being reflected by a surface , mapping the shape and size of the moon 's natural features such as valleys and mountains . " the altimeter is working correctly so far , " said oberst , adding that like the other instruments onboard the lro probe , the altimeter is still in its testing phase .
" we are really looking forward to the regular mapping phase , where we will get continuous data from the altimeter for every orbit .

in june the average producer price dropped by 4.6 percent compared to 2008 . the 4.6 percent decline in the cost of goods at the factory gate is far worse than the may decrease of 3.6 percent .
it 's also a sharper drop than widely expected , marking the strongest year-on-year decline since 1968 .
however , on a monthly basis , producer prices only dropped by 0.1 percent .
the figures can be partially explained by energy prices , which were especially high in june 2008 .
the national statistics office destatis , which published the findings , said that if changing energy prices were taken into account , then the drop would have been a more modest 2.8 percent on the year .
the cost of energy this june was 8.4 percent lower than in 2008 .
figures like these fuel concern of deflation within the 16-nation eurozone , where consumer prices fell for the first time on record in june .
as the world 's leading exporter , germany 's economy is particularly sensitive to the price of goods .
the country is in the midst of its worst recession since 1945 , in the first quarter of 2009 economic activity contracted by 3.8 percent compared to the previous quarter. msh / afpe / reuters editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government says there are only 483 rough sleepers across england .
but homeless charities say extra efforts are made to get people off the streets just before they are counted .
campaigners say these are often temporary measures which disguise the true scale of the problem .
councils deny they are manipulating figures .
local councils are asked to record the number of people sleeping on their streets on one night of the year , and those are added together for a national total .
charities housing justice and the simon community say the system is not working because although independent monitors go out on the night the count is done , there is no scrutiny of activity on the streets in the weeks running up to the count .
target the london coordinator for housing justice , sally leigh , says extra efforts are made to move people on .

" the government issues a target to each borough , and outreach staff and police work hard to achieve it , " she said .
" in the two weeks before the count , our belief is that police change their shifts to night shifts , and those identified as homeless are woken up and engaged in long conversations and invited to leave the borough over a two-week period . "
the bbc spoke to someone who has been involved with the street count in camden who said that outreach workers were switched to night shifts in the month before the count so they could spot rough sleepers and talk to them about moving on .
police did extra night shifts to help them , and rooms in b & bs were paid for to get people off the streets on the night of the count .
the bbc has also seen the minutes from a meeting of outreach teams and police in westminster .
this was held on 2 september 2008 , three weeks before a count was done there .
plans were made to carry out a dummy run for the street count .
police and outreach workers would do night shifts from 21 september leading up to the count .
the minutes state : " they will be adopting some tactics used from the march count to move people on . "
misleading in some cases , this intensive outreach work can help individual rough sleepers to find shelter , but it is not always a long-term solution .
the charities think many end up back on the streets after the count .
it also gives a misleading figure for the number of people sleeping rough on a typical night .
if the official figure is misleadingly low , there is less pressure on politicians to provide the support services those people need .
former rough sleeper tom , who said he was moved on by police in westminster on several nights last september , told the bbc : " if the public actually knew the true figures , it just would n't be acceptable in a so-called civilised country . "
" i would say in london alone you 've got 483 , easily .
" if you take into consideration birmingham , manchester , newcastle , the big cities - masses of homeless people in this country now .
" the government knows it , we know it - we 've just got to prove it . "
i can say categorically it 's not council policy to manipulate or massage the figures in any way , or take any steps to artificially reduce the numbers of people sleeping on the streets before the count councillor philippa roe some charities do their own independent counts , using the same methods .
the official count in westminster last september found 69 rough sleepers , but housing justice found 206 a fortnight earlier , and the simon community spotted 194 on one night five weeks later .
a network of london charities called chain dealt with 3,472 individuals who slept rough in london at some point in the past year .
the local authorities deny any wrongdoing .
camden council says it does not have a policy of increasing outreach activities in the run-up to a count , and says b & bs are only used for rough sleepers in exceptional circumstances .
bbc news showed the minutes of the meeting in westminster to the authority 's cabinet member for housing , councillor philippa roe , who said they surprised her greatly .
" i can say categorically it 's not council policy to manipulate or massage the figures in any way , or take any steps to artificially reduce the numbers of people sleeping on the streets before the count . "
she said that if specific tactics were being adopted to move people on ahead of the count , she would stop it .
the metropolitan police said they " do not have the power to move somebody on just because he or she chooses to sleep on street " .
it says officers in the homeless unit do more night shifts than usual in july , august and september because it is their busiest time of the year .
ministers admit the rough sleeper count is a snapshot , but they will use it to measure whether they have reached their target of eradicating rough sleeping by 2012 .
in scotland , wales and northern ireland , different methods are used to measure rough sleeping which politicians there feel are more reliable .

the government says there are only 483 rough sleepers across england .
but homeless charities say extra efforts are made to get people off the streets just before they are counted .
campaigners say these are often temporary measures which disguise the true scale of the problem .
councils deny they are manipulating figures .
local councils are asked to record the number of people sleeping on their streets on one night of the year , and those are added together for a national total .
charities housing justice and the simon community say the system is not working because although independent monitors go out on the night the count is done , there is no scrutiny of activity on the streets in the weeks running up to the count .
target the london coordinator for housing justice , sally leigh , says extra efforts are made to move people on .

" the government issues a target to each borough , and outreach staff and police work hard to achieve it , " she said .
" in the two weeks before the count , our belief is that police change their shifts to night shifts , and those identified as homeless are woken up and engaged in long conversations and invited to leave the borough over a two-week period . "
the bbc spoke to someone who has been involved with the street count in camden who said that outreach workers were switched to night shifts in the month before the count so they could spot rough sleepers and talk to them about moving on .
police did extra night shifts to help them , and rooms in b & bs were paid for to get people off the streets on the night of the count .
the bbc has also seen the minutes from a meeting of outreach teams and police in westminster .
this was held on 2 september 2008 , three weeks before a count was done there .
plans were made to carry out a dummy run for the street count .
police and outreach workers would do night shifts from 21 september leading up to the count .
the minutes state : " they will be adopting some tactics used from the march count to move people on . "
misleading in some cases , this intensive outreach work can help individual rough sleepers to find shelter , but it is not always a long-term solution .
the charities think many end up back on the streets after the count .
it also gives a misleading figure for the number of people sleeping rough on a typical night .
if the official figure is misleadingly low , there is less pressure on politicians to provide the support services those people need .
former rough sleeper tom , who said he was moved on by police in westminster on several nights last september , told the bbc : " if the public actually knew the true figures , it just would n't be acceptable in a so-called civilised country . "
" i would say in london alone you 've got 483 , easily .
" if you take into consideration birmingham , manchester , newcastle , the big cities - masses of homeless people in this country now .
" the government knows it , we know it - we 've just got to prove it . "
i can say categorically it 's not council policy to manipulate or massage the figures in any way , or take any steps to artificially reduce the numbers of people sleeping on the streets before the count councillor philippa roe some charities do their own independent counts , using the same methods .
the official count in westminster last september found 69 rough sleepers , but housing justice found 206 a fortnight earlier , and the simon community spotted 194 on one night five weeks later .
a network of london charities called chain dealt with 3,472 individuals who slept rough in london at some point in the past year .
the local authorities deny any wrongdoing .
camden council says it does not have a policy of increasing outreach activities in the run-up to a count , and says b & bs are only used for rough sleepers in exceptional circumstances .
bbc news showed the minutes of the meeting in westminster to the authority 's cabinet member for housing , councillor philippa roe , who said they surprised her greatly .
" i can say categorically it 's not council policy to manipulate or massage the figures in any way , or take any steps to artificially reduce the numbers of people sleeping on the streets before the count . "
she said that if specific tactics were being adopted to move people on ahead of the count , she would stop it .
the metropolitan police said they " do not have the power to move somebody on just because he or she chooses to sleep on street " .
it says officers in the homeless unit do more night shifts than usual in july , august and september because it is their busiest time of the year .
ministers admit the rough sleeper count is a snapshot , but they will use it to measure whether they have reached their target of eradicating rough sleeping by 2012 .
in scotland , wales and northern ireland , different methods are used to measure rough sleeping which politicians there feel are more reliable .
