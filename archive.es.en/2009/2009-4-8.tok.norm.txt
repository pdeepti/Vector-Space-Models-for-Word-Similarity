program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 08.04.2009 rifts remain over global climate deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reducing carbon emissions is a key issue in ongoing un-led climate negotiations un-led climate talks in bonn have ended with little visible progress .
a compromise is needed soon if a global action plan against climate change is to be signed at the copenhagen summit in december . eleven days of un-led climate talks in the german city of bonn have ended without making any visible progress toward a global action against climate change .
the talks , which included some 2,700 representatives from 180 countries , were the latest in a series of un-led meetings meant to forge a deal in copenhagen in december to replace or extend the kyoto protocol .
some participants said the deadlock at the bonn meeting was reminiscent of the chicken and egg problem .
industrialized and developing countries were loath to make concrete commitments and appeared to be waiting for the other side to make the first move .
the main quarrel , which also emerged again at the bonn meeting , was about carbon emission targets and financing the battle against climate change .
row over emission targets and funds " i would n't say these talks have been successful .
one of the things countries were supposed to agree on was an overall target for developed countries but this was not achieved .
so i would say we 're coming out of the negotiations with not much more than we went in with , " said stephanie tunmore , a climate campaigner for greenpeace international . developing countries had hoped the meeting would set a range of emissions reduction targets for the group of industrialized nations as a whole .
developed countries , however , preffered to procrastinate until other talks on technical issues were concluded , for example on how far they could offset their emissions and count the effect of planting trees .
us policy shift signals hope however , not all was gloom and doom in bonn .
delegates did give their general backing to some specific technical proposals , such as the formation of a registry to measure and reward climate action in developing countries , and delegates were also heartened by the more constructive approach taken by the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the previous us administration under george w. bush refused to sign the kyoto protocol " it was really refreshing to get this attitude from a us delegation that spent the last eight years stalling and refusing to act .
so i think you could definitely say that within the negotiations there has been a subtle change in atmosphere that even if they 're not actually doing the work yet , the trust is starting to get rebuilt , " said tunmore .
the united states ' commitments are considered key to climate negotiations , however , president barack obama 's fledgling administration has not made any specific pledges yet .
the european union plans to reduce greenhouse gases by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .
more ambitious carbon reduction targets needed but the united nations ' climate chief yvo de boer indicated during wednesday 's press conference in bonn that even these targets might not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's head of climate change yvo de boer is calling on industrialized nations to further cut greenhouse gases " the intergovernmental panel on climate change has indicated that if we want to avoid severe impact of climate change we need to be working towards industrialised country emission reductions in the order of minus 25-40 by 2020 , " de boer said .
" the numbers that have been discussed so far are still a significant distance from that range , so more ambition is needed on behalf of industrialised countries if we are to get a robust response to climate change . "
looking ahead to the copenhagen summit , de boer called for more clarity and commitment if a successful global deal on climate change was to be reached .
" firstly we need clarity on the individual emission reduction targets to be adopted by industrialised countries , secondly we need clarity on what major developing countries will do to limit the growth of their emissions , " said de boer .
developing countries bear the brunt the un climate chief added the copenhagen summit had to deliver clarity on finance .
developing countries were to receive financial support to allow them to engage on mitigation to limit the growth of their emissions .
however , de boer emphasised that it was just as important that developing countries received financial support in order to adapt to the impact of climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries are bearing the brunt of climate change which often results in drought and flooding environment and development groups have been urging swifter action for years .
many warn that unabated climate change will cause human suffering far worse than the present financial crisis .
developing countries are likely to bear the brunt since many are situated in areas where desertification and flooding already constitute signficant problems .
the next un climate gathering is scheduled for june .
that meeting marks a deadline to start formal negotiations .
de boer has said that a negotiating text would be on the table by then , enabling a successful conclusion of climate talks at the copenhagen summit in december . nk / th , dpa / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a compromise is needed soon if a global action plan against climate change is to be signed at the copenhagen summit in december . eleven days of un-led climate talks in the german city of bonn have ended without making any visible progress toward a global action against climate change .
the talks , which included some 2,700 representatives from 180 countries , were the latest in a series of un-led meetings meant to forge a deal in copenhagen in december to replace or extend the kyoto protocol .
some participants said the deadlock at the bonn meeting was reminiscent of the chicken and egg problem .
industrialized and developing countries were loath to make concrete commitments and appeared to be waiting for the other side to make the first move .
the main quarrel , which also emerged again at the bonn meeting , was about carbon emission targets and financing the battle against climate change .
row over emission targets and funds " i would n't say these talks have been successful .
one of the things countries were supposed to agree on was an overall target for developed countries but this was not achieved .
so i would say we 're coming out of the negotiations with not much more than we went in with , " said stephanie tunmore , a climate campaigner for greenpeace international . developing countries had hoped the meeting would set a range of emissions reduction targets for the group of industrialized nations as a whole .
developed countries , however , preffered to procrastinate until other talks on technical issues were concluded , for example on how far they could offset their emissions and count the effect of planting trees .
us policy shift signals hope however , not all was gloom and doom in bonn .
delegates did give their general backing to some specific technical proposals , such as the formation of a registry to measure and reward climate action in developing countries , and delegates were also heartened by the more constructive approach taken by the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the previous us administration under george w. bush refused to sign the kyoto protocol " it was really refreshing to get this attitude from a us delegation that spent the last eight years stalling and refusing to act .
so i think you could definitely say that within the negotiations there has been a subtle change in atmosphere that even if they 're not actually doing the work yet , the trust is starting to get rebuilt , " said tunmore .

" the numbers that have been discussed so far are still a significant distance from that range , so more ambition is needed on behalf of industrialised countries if we are to get a robust response to climate change . "
looking ahead to the copenhagen summit , de boer called for more clarity and commitment if a successful global deal on climate change was to be reached .
" firstly we need clarity on the individual emission reduction targets to be adopted by industrialised countries , secondly we need clarity on what major developing countries will do to limit the growth of their emissions , " said de boer .
developing countries bear the brunt the un climate chief added the copenhagen summit had to deliver clarity on finance .
developing countries were to receive financial support to allow them to engage on mitigation to limit the growth of their emissions .

a compromise is needed soon if a global action plan against climate change is to be signed at the copenhagen summit in december . eleven days of un-led climate talks in the german city of bonn have ended without making any visible progress toward a global action against climate change .
the talks , which included some 2,700 representatives from 180 countries , were the latest in a series of un-led meetings meant to forge a deal in copenhagen in december to replace or extend the kyoto protocol .
some participants said the deadlock at the bonn meeting was reminiscent of the chicken and egg problem .
industrialized and developing countries were loath to make concrete commitments and appeared to be waiting for the other side to make the first move .
the main quarrel , which also emerged again at the bonn meeting , was about carbon emission targets and financing the battle against climate change .
row over emission targets and funds " i would n't say these talks have been successful .
one of the things countries were supposed to agree on was an overall target for developed countries but this was not achieved .
so i would say we 're coming out of the negotiations with not much more than we went in with , " said stephanie tunmore , a climate campaigner for greenpeace international . developing countries had hoped the meeting would set a range of emissions reduction targets for the group of industrialized nations as a whole .
developed countries , however , preffered to procrastinate until other talks on technical issues were concluded , for example on how far they could offset their emissions and count the effect of planting trees .
us policy shift signals hope however , not all was gloom and doom in bonn .
delegates did give their general backing to some specific technical proposals , such as the formation of a registry to measure and reward climate action in developing countries , and delegates were also heartened by the more constructive approach taken by the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the previous us administration under george w. bush refused to sign the kyoto protocol " it was really refreshing to get this attitude from a us delegation that spent the last eight years stalling and refusing to act .
so i think you could definitely say that within the negotiations there has been a subtle change in atmosphere that even if they 're not actually doing the work yet , the trust is starting to get rebuilt , " said tunmore .
the united states ' commitments are considered key to climate negotiations , however , president barack obama 's fledgling administration has not made any specific pledges yet .
the european union plans to reduce greenhouse gases by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .
more ambitious carbon reduction targets needed but the united nations ' climate chief yvo de boer indicated during wednesday 's press conference in bonn that even these targets might not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's head of climate change yvo de boer is calling on industrialized nations to further cut greenhouse gases " the intergovernmental panel on climate change has indicated that if we want to avoid severe impact of climate change we need to be working towards industrialised country emission reductions in the order of minus 25-40 by 2020 , " de boer said .
" the numbers that have been discussed so far are still a significant distance from that range , so more ambition is needed on behalf of industrialised countries if we are to get a robust response to climate change . "
looking ahead to the copenhagen summit , de boer called for more clarity and commitment if a successful global deal on climate change was to be reached .
" firstly we need clarity on the individual emission reduction targets to be adopted by industrialised countries , secondly we need clarity on what major developing countries will do to limit the growth of their emissions , " said de boer .
developing countries bear the brunt the un climate chief added the copenhagen summit had to deliver clarity on finance .
developing countries were to receive financial support to allow them to engage on mitigation to limit the growth of their emissions .
however , de boer emphasised that it was just as important that developing countries received financial support in order to adapt to the impact of climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries are bearing the brunt of climate change which often results in drought and flooding environment and development groups have been urging swifter action for years .
many warn that unabated climate change will cause human suffering far worse than the present financial crisis .
developing countries are likely to bear the brunt since many are situated in areas where desertification and flooding already constitute signficant problems .
the next un climate gathering is scheduled for june .
that meeting marks a deadline to start formal negotiations .
de boer has said that a negotiating text would be on the table by then , enabling a successful conclusion of climate talks at the copenhagen summit in december . nk / th , dpa / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 08.04.2009 unrest in moldova brings complicated state into international focus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-communist protests have dragged moldova into the spotlight the current unrest in moldova over disputed election results has turned the international spotlight on the small former soviet state and its complicated relationship with europe and russia . for a lot of people , it is the first time that this complicated country has entered the modern consciousness .
but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .
the violence seemed to erupt from nowhere , but the protests that rocked moldova reflected tensions that have long been simmering in a poor corner of europe perched on the east-west fault line .
" the deeper causes go back to questions of identity and what moldova 's future is , " samuel greene , deputy director at the carnegie center in moscow , told deutsche welle .
" moldova is still suffering from the aftermath of a civil war and it does n't have full sovereignty over its territory .
in addition , in order to keep the peace voronin has struck a compromise with russia by which it promises basically not to move towards unification with romania , which was being discussed at some point ; it promises to really not look that seriously at european union membership and certainly not to look at nato membership . "
compromises hinder moldovan progress , say critics greene believes that many moldovans accuse the communist government 's compliance with russian demands of holding the country back and that has led , to a certain degree , to the violent protests .
" these compromises have closed off socio-economic prospects for a large part of the moldovan population that really did n't have a hand in making those compromises and did n't necessarily approve of those compromises , " he said .
" when the ruling group that had made those compromises and essentially closed that door for moldova announces that it is trying to stay in power indefinitely and at any cost and any means , it can lead to a certain amount of emotion and maybe even desperation .
what we 're seeing now is a sort of ' now or never ' situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 demonstrators stormed the palace and parliament with voronin 's communist party likely to remain in power despite doubts over the validity of the vote , there is concern that the protests could continue and even escalate .
however , greene believes that moldova has seen enough violence .
" i do n't think that we would see the return to violence and civil war , " he said .
" i think most people in moldova have been fairly shocked by the violence of these protests and have seemed not to have approved of that degree of violence .
i think that if there are further protests they are likely to a lot more peaceful . "
president 's balancing act causing frustration many experts think that the reasons for the sudden outbursts can be traced to the complicated relationship , cultivated by voronin , between moldova , the eu and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has made concessions to russia voronin , a soviet-era interior minister for moldova , has in recent years reinvented himself as " pro-eu " leader interested in forging strong ties with the west .
under his leadership , moldova has implemented the first three-year action plan within the framework of the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- which precedes accession talks .
and the eu , pushed in particular by its newest members from the former soviet bloc in eastern europe , has supported voronin , promising as recently as october to seal a " new and ambitious " relationship with moldova .
a year earlier , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia issued a joint statement pushing the eu to " acknowledge the pace of progress , moldova 's efforts and concrete achievements " under voronin 's leadership .
while turning to the west , voronin has also managed to keep relations with moscow - the supporter of the rebel transnistra region in eastern moldova - on a very warm track , also with support from the russian side .
moldova standing at east-west crossroads with voronin courting both brussels and moscow , and both sides reciprocating his overtures , each anxious not to cede dominant influence to the other , the stage was set for some kind of rupture within the country itself .
many moldovans believe that their country is going to have to make a choice : is it with europe or is it with russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has positioned moldova between the eu and russia " well , it 's a balancing act and to be honest , russia is incredibly important for moldova 's stability because it does control the fate of the breakaway republican interests in transnistra and it 's also important for moldova 's economy , " greene said .
" moldova 's economy depends tremendously on remittances from moldovans working abroad - a large number of those are in russia - and so that is obviously important to any moldovan government .
" but a large number of those workers are in europe and europe is a significantly more lucrative place for them to be than in russia , " he added .
" it is also impossible for any moldovan government to entirely close the door on europe .
but what voronin has tried to do is this balancing act which over time evolves basically into institutionalized indecisiveness that says ' we 're not going to move in any direction ' and that makes it very difficult for foreigners to invest in moldova and for people to develop the economy when you have no idea what the long term prospects for the country are . "
the eu will on may 7 launch the so-called " eastern partnership " program of closer ties with moldova along with ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan , armenia , and belarus .
the plan envisages aid , the gradual creation of a free trade zone and better energy ties .
the eu will also negotiate accords setting terms for cooperation in reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
will these initiatives sway the communists towards europe or lead to another power struggle to join the many that have gone before it in moldova 's history ?
how the new moldovan government and its russian overseers respond to these developments , only time will tell .

under his leadership , moldova has implemented the first three-year action plan within the framework of the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- which precedes accession talks .
and the eu , pushed in particular by its newest members from the former soviet bloc in eastern europe , has supported voronin , promising as recently as october to seal a " new and ambitious " relationship with moldova .
a year earlier , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia issued a joint statement pushing the eu to " acknowledge the pace of progress , moldova 's efforts and concrete achievements " under voronin 's leadership .
while turning to the west , voronin has also managed to keep relations with moscow - the supporter of the rebel transnistra region in eastern moldova - on a very warm track , also with support from the russian side .
moldova standing at east-west crossroads with voronin courting both brussels and moscow , and both sides reciprocating his overtures , each anxious not to cede dominant influence to the other , the stage was set for some kind of rupture within the country itself .
many moldovans believe that their country is going to have to make a choice : is it with europe or is it with russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has positioned moldova between the eu and russia " well , it 's a balancing act and to be honest , russia is incredibly important for moldova 's stability because it does control the fate of the breakaway republican interests in transnistra and it 's also important for moldova 's economy , " greene said .
" moldova 's economy depends tremendously on remittances from moldovans working abroad - a large number of those are in russia - and so that is obviously important to any moldovan government .
" but a large number of those workers are in europe and europe is a significantly more lucrative place for them to be than in russia , " he added .
" it is also impossible for any moldovan government to entirely close the door on europe .
but what voronin has tried to do is this balancing act which over time evolves basically into institutionalized indecisiveness that says ' we 're not going to move in any direction ' and that makes it very difficult for foreigners to invest in moldova and for people to develop the economy when you have no idea what the long term prospects for the country are . "
the eu will on may 7 launch the so-called " eastern partnership " program of closer ties with moldova along with ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan , armenia , and belarus .
the plan envisages aid , the gradual creation of a free trade zone and better energy ties .
the eu will also negotiate accords setting terms for cooperation in reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
will these initiatives sway the communists towards europe or lead to another power struggle to join the many that have gone before it in moldova 's history ?
how the new moldovan government and its russian overseers respond to these developments , only time will tell .

but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .
the violence seemed to erupt from nowhere , but the protests that rocked moldova reflected tensions that have long been simmering in a poor corner of europe perched on the east-west fault line .
" the deeper causes go back to questions of identity and what moldova 's future is , " samuel greene , deputy director at the carnegie center in moscow , told deutsche welle .
" moldova is still suffering from the aftermath of a civil war and it does n't have full sovereignty over its territory .
in addition , in order to keep the peace voronin has struck a compromise with russia by which it promises basically not to move towards unification with romania , which was being discussed at some point ; it promises to really not look that seriously at european union membership and certainly not to look at nato membership . "
compromises hinder moldovan progress , say critics greene believes that many moldovans accuse the communist government 's compliance with russian demands of holding the country back and that has led , to a certain degree , to the violent protests .
" these compromises have closed off socio-economic prospects for a large part of the moldovan population that really did n't have a hand in making those compromises and did n't necessarily approve of those compromises , " he said .
" when the ruling group that had made those compromises and essentially closed that door for moldova announces that it is trying to stay in power indefinitely and at any cost and any means , it can lead to a certain amount of emotion and maybe even desperation .
what we 're seeing now is a sort of ' now or never ' situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 demonstrators stormed the palace and parliament with voronin 's communist party likely to remain in power despite doubts over the validity of the vote , there is concern that the protests could continue and even escalate .
however , greene believes that moldova has seen enough violence .
" i do n't think that we would see the return to violence and civil war , " he said .
" i think most people in moldova have been fairly shocked by the violence of these protests and have seemed not to have approved of that degree of violence .
i think that if there are further protests they are likely to a lot more peaceful . "

in developing countries with no unemployment insurance , they are now forced to work in positions with low pay and no protection , an oecd study says . some 1.8 billion people , or more than half of the global labor force , are working without formal contracts and social security , according to the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
this level is expected to increase to two-thirds of the workforce by 2020 and could go even higher if more jobs are lost to the economic crisis and more migrants return home to informal sector jobs , said the oecd report " is informal normal ? " which was released on wednesday .
in comparison , 1.2 billion people are officially employed worldwide .
" even during good times with robust growth rates , in many developing countries informal employment increased in some regions , " said johannes jutting , one of the study 's authors .
" though india grew during the last decade above five percentage points per year , people there feel better jobs are not being created . "
jutting said nine out of 10 employees in india , or some 370 million people , did not have formal social security .
this informal employment had severe consequences for poverty in developing countries , the study said .
low pay , with no social benefits , increased the likelihood that the millennium development goal of halving poverty worldwide by 2015 would not be met .
the oecd said " immediate and unconventional action " was urgently needed .
it said measures were necessary to improve infrastructure , help develop skills , promote institutional reform and increase access to resources for informal businesses both in the formal and informal employment sectors .

in developing countries with no unemployment insurance , they are now forced to work in positions with low pay and no protection , an oecd study says . some 1.8 billion people , or more than half of the global labor force , are working without formal contracts and social security , according to the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
this level is expected to increase to two-thirds of the workforce by 2020 and could go even higher if more jobs are lost to the economic crisis and more migrants return home to informal sector jobs , said the oecd report " is informal normal ? " which was released on wednesday .
in comparison , 1.2 billion people are officially employed worldwide .
" even during good times with robust growth rates , in many developing countries informal employment increased in some regions , " said johannes jutting , one of the study 's authors .
" though india grew during the last decade above five percentage points per year , people there feel better jobs are not being created . "
jutting said nine out of 10 employees in india , or some 370 million people , did not have formal social security .
this informal employment had severe consequences for poverty in developing countries , the study said .
low pay , with no social benefits , increased the likelihood that the millennium development goal of halving poverty worldwide by 2015 would not be met .

in developing countries with no unemployment insurance , they are now forced to work in positions with low pay and no protection , an oecd study says . some 1.8 billion people , or more than half of the global labor force , are working without formal contracts and social security , according to the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
this level is expected to increase to two-thirds of the workforce by 2020 and could go even higher if more jobs are lost to the economic crisis and more migrants return home to informal sector jobs , said the oecd report " is informal normal ? " which was released on wednesday .
in comparison , 1.2 billion people are officially employed worldwide .
" even during good times with robust growth rates , in many developing countries informal employment increased in some regions , " said johannes jutting , one of the study 's authors .
" though india grew during the last decade above five percentage points per year , people there feel better jobs are not being created . "
jutting said nine out of 10 employees in india , or some 370 million people , did not have formal social security .
this informal employment had severe consequences for poverty in developing countries , the study said .
low pay , with no social benefits , increased the likelihood that the millennium development goal of halving poverty worldwide by 2015 would not be met .

but ngos say the measures are not sufficient to tackle the roots of poorer nations ' problems . the european union 's executive arm will pull forward aid to developing nations hard hit by the worldwide economic crisis .
" those least responsible for the financial crisis are among those worst hit by its economic effects , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
the european commission said it would bring forward 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in resources to 2009 previously earmarked to help poor countries fight a recession that has staunched credit flows , curtailed investment and sent a number of local currencies into a tailspin .
development commissioner louis michel said advancing money allowed the aid " to have an impact when it is most needed . "
the commission said it will speed up three billion euros , or 72 percent of its budget support to african , pacific and caribbean nations .
it will direct at least 500 million euros to support local welfare spending .
in addition , 800 million euros from an existing facility to combat hunger will be made available this year .
however , the eu will not provide additional funds .
" we did n't come here to announce to you any huge new sums , " michel said .
" of course our ambitions are limited .
but we are going to keep putting the pressure on . "
eu measures " an empty package " aid organizations , though , have criticized the eu plans .

the international anti-poverty agency actionaid said the plans left many issues open .
" we 're not clear on how europe is actually going to soften the blow of the financial crisis in poor countries , " alexandre polack , actionaid 's head of european policy , said in a statement .
polack said the package had little solutions to the problems faced by developing countries .
" we have not seen any useful ideas coming out of this package on how to support developing countries in dealing with climate change , on stopping tax evasion or on coping with the effects of trade policies , " polack said .
" the commission demonstrated its good intentions today , but what it is offering is effectively an empty package . "
by frontloading aid , the eu left open what would happen in subsequent years .
" we fear that with no new money , poor countries will suffer in years to come , when aid dries up , " said hetty kovach , oxfam international 's policy advisor on aid .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel says europe can help in relieving human suffering " i am proud that europe is first to act after the g20 in support of developing countries , " michel said .
the commission said it would focus on three main measures : " first , keeping our promises , " second , paying more quickly old money earmarked last year for developing countries , and third , having the commission and member states work more closely together to be more efficient .
barroso said no country could hold back .
" the recession must not , can not and will not be used as an excuse for going back on our promises to keep on increasing aid , " barroso said .
aid from the 27 nation bloc rose to 49 billion euros last year .
but aid volumes will need to increase to some 69 billion euros in 2010 to meet interim aid spending targets , the commission said .
" we are now more than half way to the 2015 deadline for reaching the un millennium development goals and some of the gains achieved so far risk being forfeited , leaving poor countries worse off than before the crisis , " barroso said .

but ngos say the measures are not sufficient to tackle the roots of poorer nations ' problems . the european union 's executive arm will pull forward aid to developing nations hard hit by the worldwide economic crisis .
" those least responsible for the financial crisis are among those worst hit by its economic effects , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
the european commission said it would bring forward 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in resources to 2009 previously earmarked to help poor countries fight a recession that has staunched credit flows , curtailed investment and sent a number of local currencies into a tailspin .
development commissioner louis michel said advancing money allowed the aid " to have an impact when it is most needed . "
the commission said it will speed up three billion euros , or 72 percent of its budget support to african , pacific and caribbean nations .
it will direct at least 500 million euros to support local welfare spending .
in addition , 800 million euros from an existing facility to combat hunger will be made available this year .
however , the eu will not provide additional funds .
" we did n't come here to announce to you any huge new sums , " michel said .
" of course our ambitions are limited .
but we are going to keep putting the pressure on . "
eu measures " an empty package " aid organizations , though , have criticized the eu plans .
the european ngo confederation for relief and development , concord , said the measures fell " far short " of what was needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change has hit developing nations particularly hard " less than one week after the g20 , the eu has produced a strategy that fails to address the underlying flaws in the system that we know fuel poverty in developing countries , " said concord 's eu policy officer ester asin-martinez .
the international anti-poverty agency actionaid said the plans left many issues open .
" we 're not clear on how europe is actually going to soften the blow of the financial crisis in poor countries , " alexandre polack , actionaid 's head of european policy , said in a statement .
polack said the package had little solutions to the problems faced by developing countries .
" we have not seen any useful ideas coming out of this package on how to support developing countries in dealing with climate change , on stopping tax evasion or on coping with the effects of trade policies , " polack said .
" the commission demonstrated its good intentions today , but what it is offering is effectively an empty package . "
by frontloading aid , the eu left open what would happen in subsequent years .
" we fear that with no new money , poor countries will suffer in years to come , when aid dries up , " said hetty kovach , oxfam international 's policy advisor on aid .
" europe needs to dig deep to help prevent this crisis from becoming a humanitarian disaster . "
aid must be a joint eu effort g20 leaders last week in london agreed on an international strategy to pull the global economy out of crisis , including new moves to help poor nations .
europe is the biggest aid donor in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel says europe can help in relieving human suffering " i am proud that europe is first to act after the g20 in support of developing countries , " michel said .
the commission said it would focus on three main measures : " first , keeping our promises , " second , paying more quickly old money earmarked last year for developing countries , and third , having the commission and member states work more closely together to be more efficient .
barroso said no country could hold back .
" the recession must not , can not and will not be used as an excuse for going back on our promises to keep on increasing aid , " barroso said .
aid from the 27 nation bloc rose to 49 billion euros last year .
but aid volumes will need to increase to some 69 billion euros in 2010 to meet interim aid spending targets , the commission said .
" we are now more than half way to the 2015 deadline for reaching the un millennium development goals and some of the gains achieved so far risk being forfeited , leaving poor countries worse off than before the crisis , " barroso said .
world leaders of 189 countries agreed on the so-called millennium development goals in 2000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 08.04.2009 eu advances aid for developing nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large share of development aid goes towards food the european commission has outlined plans to bring forward development aid earmarked for later years .
but ngos say the measures are not sufficient to tackle the roots of poorer nations ' problems . the european union 's executive arm will pull forward aid to developing nations hard hit by the worldwide economic crisis .
" those least responsible for the financial crisis are among those worst hit by its economic effects , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
the european commission said it would bring forward 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in resources to 2009 previously earmarked to help poor countries fight a recession that has staunched credit flows , curtailed investment and sent a number of local currencies into a tailspin .
development commissioner louis michel said advancing money allowed the aid " to have an impact when it is most needed . "
the commission said it will speed up three billion euros , or 72 percent of its budget support to african , pacific and caribbean nations .
it will direct at least 500 million euros to support local welfare spending .
in addition , 800 million euros from an existing facility to combat hunger will be made available this year .
however , the eu will not provide additional funds .
" we did n't come here to announce to you any huge new sums , " michel said .
" of course our ambitions are limited .
but we are going to keep putting the pressure on . "
eu measures " an empty package " aid organizations , though , have criticized the eu plans .
the european ngo confederation for relief and development , concord , said the measures fell " far short " of what was needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change has hit developing nations particularly hard " less than one week after the g20 , the eu has produced a strategy that fails to address the underlying flaws in the system that we know fuel poverty in developing countries , " said concord 's eu policy officer ester asin-martinez .
the international anti-poverty agency actionaid said the plans left many issues open .
" we 're not clear on how europe is actually going to soften the blow of the financial crisis in poor countries , " alexandre polack , actionaid 's head of european policy , said in a statement .
polack said the package had little solutions to the problems faced by developing countries .
" we have not seen any useful ideas coming out of this package on how to support developing countries in dealing with climate change , on stopping tax evasion or on coping with the effects of trade policies , " polack said .
" the commission demonstrated its good intentions today , but what it is offering is effectively an empty package . "
by frontloading aid , the eu left open what would happen in subsequent years .
" we fear that with no new money , poor countries will suffer in years to come , when aid dries up , " said hetty kovach , oxfam international 's policy advisor on aid .
" europe needs to dig deep to help prevent this crisis from becoming a humanitarian disaster . "
aid must be a joint eu effort g20 leaders last week in london agreed on an international strategy to pull the global economy out of crisis , including new moves to help poor nations .
europe is the biggest aid donor in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel says europe can help in relieving human suffering " i am proud that europe is first to act after the g20 in support of developing countries , " michel said .
the commission said it would focus on three main measures : " first , keeping our promises , " second , paying more quickly old money earmarked last year for developing countries , and third , having the commission and member states work more closely together to be more efficient .
barroso said no country could hold back .
" the recession must not , can not and will not be used as an excuse for going back on our promises to keep on increasing aid , " barroso said .
aid from the 27 nation bloc rose to 49 billion euros last year .
but aid volumes will need to increase to some 69 billion euros in 2010 to meet interim aid spending targets , the commission said .
" we are now more than half way to the 2015 deadline for reaching the un millennium development goals and some of the gains achieved so far risk being forfeited , leaving poor countries worse off than before the crisis , " barroso said .
world leaders of 189 countries agreed on the so-called millennium development goals in 2000 .
they consist of eight targets for reducing poverty by 2015 - including halving the number of people living on less than $ 1 a day . sac / rm , reuters / afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the drop means europe 's largest economy will contract more than expected . according to the latest figures published on wednesday by the federal statistics office , exports fell 23.1 percent to just under 65 billion euros in february , compared to the same period last year .
this follows a similarly precipitous drop of 23.2 percent in january .
the two-month decline is the worst since world war ii .
imports also dropped 16.4 percent to 56.2 billion euros compared to a year ago .
exports to european union countries were particularly hard hit , slumping 24.4 percent to 41 billion euros in february , while exports outside the eu fell 20.6 percent for the month to 23.8 billion euros .
as the world 's largest exporting nation , germany has been severely affected by fluctuations in the global economy .
german corporate investment and household consumption have failed to make up for the sharp decline in trade .

" the subsidy has proven to be an especially successful instrument , " wilhelm said , referring to the 40 percent rise in car sales observed in march . " for this reason the coalition has agreed to an extension and an increase in funds . " the trade-in scheme is part of government stimulus package aimed at shoring up the economy in the face of a global downturn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is giving consumers 2,500 good reasons to scrap their old car and buy a new one it offers german car owners a government bonus of 2,500 euros for scrapping vehicles older than nine years and replacing them with new fuel-efficient models . more than a million german car owners have already applied for the subsidy , far exceeding government expectations of the scheme , which was originally intended to accommodate a maximum of 600,000 consumers . by more than tripling the funds earmarked for bonus payments , the scheme can now accommodate up to two million consumers . negative side effects ? while the government praises its car-scrapping premium as a great success , critics argue that the negative side-effects of the scheme are being overlooked .
these include falling sales at car parts retailers , auto repair shops and used-car dealers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the scheme does not benefit high-end german brands other detractors point out that small carmakers , especially from asia , have benefitted most from the incentive plan , while major german luxury brands , such as daimler and bmw , have reaped little reward . some members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union had opposed extending the bonus payments on cost grounds , warning that pumping more money into the scheme would only prolong germany 's worst economic downturn since world war ii . economic stimulus measures introduced by the german government are already expected to create 40-50 billion euros of new debt this year . but with some 40 million motorists driving to the polls for national elections in september , it seems few leading politicians in berlin are willing to oppose such a popular subsidy scheme . sje / pfd , dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 08.04.2009 rifts remain over global climate deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reducing carbon emissions is a key issue in ongoing un-led climate negotiations un-led climate talks in bonn have ended with little visible progress .
a compromise is needed soon if a global action plan against climate change is to be signed at the copenhagen summit in december . eleven days of un-led climate talks in the german city of bonn have ended without making any visible progress toward a global action against climate change .
the talks , which included some 2,700 representatives from 180 countries , were the latest in a series of un-led meetings meant to forge a deal in copenhagen in december to replace or extend the kyoto protocol .
some participants said the deadlock at the bonn meeting was reminiscent of the chicken and egg problem .
industrialized and developing countries were loath to make concrete commitments and appeared to be waiting for the other side to make the first move .
the main quarrel , which also emerged again at the bonn meeting , was about carbon emission targets and financing the battle against climate change .
row over emission targets and funds " i would n't say these talks have been successful .
one of the things countries were supposed to agree on was an overall target for developed countries but this was not achieved .
so i would say we 're coming out of the negotiations with not much more than we went in with , " said stephanie tunmore , a climate campaigner for greenpeace international . developing countries had hoped the meeting would set a range of emissions reduction targets for the group of industrialized nations as a whole .
developed countries , however , preffered to procrastinate until other talks on technical issues were concluded , for example on how far they could offset their emissions and count the effect of planting trees .
us policy shift signals hope however , not all was gloom and doom in bonn .
delegates did give their general backing to some specific technical proposals , such as the formation of a registry to measure and reward climate action in developing countries , and delegates were also heartened by the more constructive approach taken by the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the previous us administration under george w. bush refused to sign the kyoto protocol " it was really refreshing to get this attitude from a us delegation that spent the last eight years stalling and refusing to act .
so i think you could definitely say that within the negotiations there has been a subtle change in atmosphere that even if they 're not actually doing the work yet , the trust is starting to get rebuilt , " said tunmore .
the united states ' commitments are considered key to climate negotiations , however , president barack obama 's fledgling administration has not made any specific pledges yet .
the european union plans to reduce greenhouse gases by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .
more ambitious carbon reduction targets needed but the united nations ' climate chief yvo de boer indicated during wednesday 's press conference in bonn that even these targets might not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's head of climate change yvo de boer is calling on industrialized nations to further cut greenhouse gases " the intergovernmental panel on climate change has indicated that if we want to avoid severe impact of climate change we need to be working towards industrialised country emission reductions in the order of minus 25-40 by 2020 , " de boer said .
" the numbers that have been discussed so far are still a significant distance from that range , so more ambition is needed on behalf of industrialised countries if we are to get a robust response to climate change . "
looking ahead to the copenhagen summit , de boer called for more clarity and commitment if a successful global deal on climate change was to be reached .
" firstly we need clarity on the individual emission reduction targets to be adopted by industrialised countries , secondly we need clarity on what major developing countries will do to limit the growth of their emissions , " said de boer .
developing countries bear the brunt the un climate chief added the copenhagen summit had to deliver clarity on finance .
developing countries were to receive financial support to allow them to engage on mitigation to limit the growth of their emissions .
however , de boer emphasised that it was just as important that developing countries received financial support in order to adapt to the impact of climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries are bearing the brunt of climate change which often results in drought and flooding environment and development groups have been urging swifter action for years .
many warn that unabated climate change will cause human suffering far worse than the present financial crisis .
developing countries are likely to bear the brunt since many are situated in areas where desertification and flooding already constitute signficant problems .
the next un climate gathering is scheduled for june .
that meeting marks a deadline to start formal negotiations .
de boer has said that a negotiating text would be on the table by then , enabling a successful conclusion of climate talks at the copenhagen summit in december . nk / th , dpa / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" mission impossible " " it feels like a mission impossible , but we know from experience that miracles or upsets do happen in football , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grafite 's back-heel goal against munich is likely to become legend bayern munich will be without injured central defender lucio , who picked up a muscle injury in the game against wolfsburg .
bayern are also without injured striker miroslav klose who is out for several weeks following surgery .
" we clearly expect that the team bends over backwards now , " rummenigge told the club website .
" it is now up to the team .
the team has to shoulder the responsibility now . "
the kaiser criticizes klinsmann the humiliating defeat at the hands of wolfsburg has cast doubts on jürgen klinsmann 's future as bayern coach .
the clouds on the horizon are likely to darken further if the bavarians fail to reach the semis of the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all was harmony last year when klinsmann became the new bayern coach bayern munich president franz beckenbauer , or " the kaiser " as the germans like to call him , already caused a stir after the wolfsburg match by saying that bayern would have to reconsider klinsmann 's future at the club after this season .
however , he was immediately rebuffed by manager uli hoeneß .
" sometimes i 'm not sure whether franz is close enough to what 's actually happening to make a proper assessment , " hoeneß said .
klinsmann 's contract expires in 2010 , and bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has reportedly given klinsmann a job guarantee beyond the current contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's late cl final defeat in nou camp in 1999 traumatized players and fans alike nou camp – a bad omen for bayern ?
victory in barcelona would boost klinsmann 's prospects and silence critics , for the time being .
however , barca will be tough opponents and there is another aspect which may play a crucial psychological role .
bayern are likely to have bitter memories about their last trip to the nou camp which was the 1999 champions league final they famously lost 2-1 after leading 1-0 for most of the game against manchester united who scored two injury time goals through teddy sheringham and ole gunnar solskjaer . nk / pfd / rm dpa / rtr / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 08.04.2009 unrest in moldova brings complicated state into international focus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-communist protests have dragged moldova into the spotlight the current unrest in moldova over disputed election results has turned the international spotlight on the small former soviet state and its complicated relationship with europe and russia . for a lot of people , it is the first time that this complicated country has entered the modern consciousness .
but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .
the violence seemed to erupt from nowhere , but the protests that rocked moldova reflected tensions that have long been simmering in a poor corner of europe perched on the east-west fault line .
" the deeper causes go back to questions of identity and what moldova 's future is , " samuel greene , deputy director at the carnegie center in moscow , told deutsche welle .
" moldova is still suffering from the aftermath of a civil war and it does n't have full sovereignty over its territory .
in addition , in order to keep the peace voronin has struck a compromise with russia by which it promises basically not to move towards unification with romania , which was being discussed at some point ; it promises to really not look that seriously at european union membership and certainly not to look at nato membership . "
compromises hinder moldovan progress , say critics greene believes that many moldovans accuse the communist government 's compliance with russian demands of holding the country back and that has led , to a certain degree , to the violent protests .
" these compromises have closed off socio-economic prospects for a large part of the moldovan population that really did n't have a hand in making those compromises and did n't necessarily approve of those compromises , " he said .
" when the ruling group that had made those compromises and essentially closed that door for moldova announces that it is trying to stay in power indefinitely and at any cost and any means , it can lead to a certain amount of emotion and maybe even desperation .
what we 're seeing now is a sort of ' now or never ' situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 demonstrators stormed the palace and parliament with voronin 's communist party likely to remain in power despite doubts over the validity of the vote , there is concern that the protests could continue and even escalate .
however , greene believes that moldova has seen enough violence .
" i do n't think that we would see the return to violence and civil war , " he said .
" i think most people in moldova have been fairly shocked by the violence of these protests and have seemed not to have approved of that degree of violence .
i think that if there are further protests they are likely to a lot more peaceful . "
president 's balancing act causing frustration many experts think that the reasons for the sudden outbursts can be traced to the complicated relationship , cultivated by voronin , between moldova , the eu and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has made concessions to russia voronin , a soviet-era interior minister for moldova , has in recent years reinvented himself as " pro-eu " leader interested in forging strong ties with the west .
under his leadership , moldova has implemented the first three-year action plan within the framework of the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- which precedes accession talks .
and the eu , pushed in particular by its newest members from the former soviet bloc in eastern europe , has supported voronin , promising as recently as october to seal a " new and ambitious " relationship with moldova .
a year earlier , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia issued a joint statement pushing the eu to " acknowledge the pace of progress , moldova 's efforts and concrete achievements " under voronin 's leadership .
while turning to the west , voronin has also managed to keep relations with moscow - the supporter of the rebel transnistra region in eastern moldova - on a very warm track , also with support from the russian side .
moldova standing at east-west crossroads with voronin courting both brussels and moscow , and both sides reciprocating his overtures , each anxious not to cede dominant influence to the other , the stage was set for some kind of rupture within the country itself .
many moldovans believe that their country is going to have to make a choice : is it with europe or is it with russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has positioned moldova between the eu and russia " well , it 's a balancing act and to be honest , russia is incredibly important for moldova 's stability because it does control the fate of the breakaway republican interests in transnistra and it 's also important for moldova 's economy , " greene said .
" moldova 's economy depends tremendously on remittances from moldovans working abroad - a large number of those are in russia - and so that is obviously important to any moldovan government .
" but a large number of those workers are in europe and europe is a significantly more lucrative place for them to be than in russia , " he added .
" it is also impossible for any moldovan government to entirely close the door on europe .
but what voronin has tried to do is this balancing act which over time evolves basically into institutionalized indecisiveness that says ' we 're not going to move in any direction ' and that makes it very difficult for foreigners to invest in moldova and for people to develop the economy when you have no idea what the long term prospects for the country are . "
the eu will on may 7 launch the so-called " eastern partnership " program of closer ties with moldova along with ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan , armenia , and belarus .
the plan envisages aid , the gradual creation of a free trade zone and better energy ties .
the eu will also negotiate accords setting terms for cooperation in reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
will these initiatives sway the communists towards europe or lead to another power struggle to join the many that have gone before it in moldova 's history ?
how the new moldovan government and its russian overseers respond to these developments , only time will tell .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 08.04.2009 unrest in moldova brings complicated state into international focus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-communist protests have dragged moldova into the spotlight the current unrest in moldova over disputed election results has turned the international spotlight on the small former soviet state and its complicated relationship with europe and russia . for a lot of people , it is the first time that this complicated country has entered the modern consciousness .
but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .
the violence seemed to erupt from nowhere , but the protests that rocked moldova reflected tensions that have long been simmering in a poor corner of europe perched on the east-west fault line .
" the deeper causes go back to questions of identity and what moldova 's future is , " samuel greene , deputy director at the carnegie center in moscow , told deutsche welle .
" moldova is still suffering from the aftermath of a civil war and it does n't have full sovereignty over its territory .
in addition , in order to keep the peace voronin has struck a compromise with russia by which it promises basically not to move towards unification with romania , which was being discussed at some point ; it promises to really not look that seriously at european union membership and certainly not to look at nato membership . "
compromises hinder moldovan progress , say critics greene believes that many moldovans accuse the communist government 's compliance with russian demands of holding the country back and that has led , to a certain degree , to the violent protests .
" these compromises have closed off socio-economic prospects for a large part of the moldovan population that really did n't have a hand in making those compromises and did n't necessarily approve of those compromises , " he said .
" when the ruling group that had made those compromises and essentially closed that door for moldova announces that it is trying to stay in power indefinitely and at any cost and any means , it can lead to a certain amount of emotion and maybe even desperation .
what we 're seeing now is a sort of ' now or never ' situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 demonstrators stormed the palace and parliament with voronin 's communist party likely to remain in power despite doubts over the validity of the vote , there is concern that the protests could continue and even escalate .
however , greene believes that moldova has seen enough violence .
" i do n't think that we would see the return to violence and civil war , " he said .
" i think most people in moldova have been fairly shocked by the violence of these protests and have seemed not to have approved of that degree of violence .
i think that if there are further protests they are likely to a lot more peaceful . "
president 's balancing act causing frustration many experts think that the reasons for the sudden outbursts can be traced to the complicated relationship , cultivated by voronin , between moldova , the eu and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has made concessions to russia voronin , a soviet-era interior minister for moldova , has in recent years reinvented himself as " pro-eu " leader interested in forging strong ties with the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 08.04.2009 unrest in moldova brings complicated state into international focus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-communist protests have dragged moldova into the spotlight the current unrest in moldova over disputed election results has turned the international spotlight on the small former soviet state and its complicated relationship with europe and russia . for a lot of people , it is the first time that this complicated country has entered the modern consciousness .
but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .
the violence seemed to erupt from nowhere , but the protests that rocked moldova reflected tensions that have long been simmering in a poor corner of europe perched on the east-west fault line .
" the deeper causes go back to questions of identity and what moldova 's future is , " samuel greene , deputy director at the carnegie center in moscow , told deutsche welle .
" moldova is still suffering from the aftermath of a civil war and it does n't have full sovereignty over its territory .
in addition , in order to keep the peace voronin has struck a compromise with russia by which it promises basically not to move towards unification with romania , which was being discussed at some point ; it promises to really not look that seriously at european union membership and certainly not to look at nato membership . "
compromises hinder moldovan progress , say critics greene believes that many moldovans accuse the communist government 's compliance with russian demands of holding the country back and that has led , to a certain degree , to the violent protests .
" these compromises have closed off socio-economic prospects for a large part of the moldovan population that really did n't have a hand in making those compromises and did n't necessarily approve of those compromises , " he said .
" when the ruling group that had made those compromises and essentially closed that door for moldova announces that it is trying to stay in power indefinitely and at any cost and any means , it can lead to a certain amount of emotion and maybe even desperation .
what we 're seeing now is a sort of ' now or never ' situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 demonstrators stormed the palace and parliament with voronin 's communist party likely to remain in power despite doubts over the validity of the vote , there is concern that the protests could continue and even escalate .
however , greene believes that moldova has seen enough violence .
" i do n't think that we would see the return to violence and civil war , " he said .
" i think most people in moldova have been fairly shocked by the violence of these protests and have seemed not to have approved of that degree of violence .
i think that if there are further protests they are likely to a lot more peaceful . "
president 's balancing act causing frustration many experts think that the reasons for the sudden outbursts can be traced to the complicated relationship , cultivated by voronin , between moldova , the eu and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has made concessions to russia voronin , a soviet-era interior minister for moldova , has in recent years reinvented himself as " pro-eu " leader interested in forging strong ties with the west .
under his leadership , moldova has implemented the first three-year action plan within the framework of the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- which precedes accession talks .
and the eu , pushed in particular by its newest members from the former soviet bloc in eastern europe , has supported voronin , promising as recently as october to seal a " new and ambitious " relationship with moldova .
a year earlier , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia issued a joint statement pushing the eu to " acknowledge the pace of progress , moldova 's efforts and concrete achievements " under voronin 's leadership .
while turning to the west , voronin has also managed to keep relations with moscow - the supporter of the rebel transnistra region in eastern moldova - on a very warm track , also with support from the russian side .
moldova standing at east-west crossroads with voronin courting both brussels and moscow , and both sides reciprocating his overtures , each anxious not to cede dominant influence to the other , the stage was set for some kind of rupture within the country itself .
many moldovans believe that their country is going to have to make a choice : is it with europe or is it with russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has positioned moldova between the eu and russia " well , it 's a balancing act and to be honest , russia is incredibly important for moldova 's stability because it does control the fate of the breakaway republican interests in transnistra and it 's also important for moldova 's economy , " greene said .
" moldova 's economy depends tremendously on remittances from moldovans working abroad - a large number of those are in russia - and so that is obviously important to any moldovan government .
" but a large number of those workers are in europe and europe is a significantly more lucrative place for them to be than in russia , " he added .
" it is also impossible for any moldovan government to entirely close the door on europe .
but what voronin has tried to do is this balancing act which over time evolves basically into institutionalized indecisiveness that says ' we 're not going to move in any direction ' and that makes it very difficult for foreigners to invest in moldova and for people to develop the economy when you have no idea what the long term prospects for the country are . "
the eu will on may 7 launch the so-called " eastern partnership " program of closer ties with moldova along with ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan , armenia , and belarus .
the plan envisages aid , the gradual creation of a free trade zone and better energy ties .
the eu will also negotiate accords setting terms for cooperation in reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
will these initiatives sway the communists towards europe or lead to another power struggle to join the many that have gone before it in moldova 's history ?
how the new moldovan government and its russian overseers respond to these developments , only time will tell .

in developing countries with no unemployment insurance , they are now forced to work in positions with low pay and no protection , an oecd study says . some 1.8 billion people , or more than half of the global labor force , are working without formal contracts and social security , according to the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
this level is expected to increase to two-thirds of the workforce by 2020 and could go even higher if more jobs are lost to the economic crisis and more migrants return home to informal sector jobs , said the oecd report " is informal normal ? " which was released on wednesday .
in comparison , 1.2 billion people are officially employed worldwide .
" even during good times with robust growth rates , in many developing countries informal employment increased in some regions , " said johannes jutting , one of the study 's authors .
" though india grew during the last decade above five percentage points per year , people there feel better jobs are not being created . "
jutting said nine out of 10 employees in india , or some 370 million people , did not have formal social security .
this informal employment had severe consequences for poverty in developing countries , the study said .
low pay , with no social benefits , increased the likelihood that the millennium development goal of halving poverty worldwide by 2015 would not be met .
the oecd said " immediate and unconventional action " was urgently needed .
it said measures were necessary to improve infrastructure , help develop skills , promote institutional reform and increase access to resources for informal businesses both in the formal and informal employment sectors .
these steps should be accompanied by public works projects and better access to micro loans . sac / rm , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in developing countries with no unemployment insurance , they are now forced to work in positions with low pay and no protection , an oecd study says . some 1.8 billion people , or more than half of the global labor force , are working without formal contracts and social security , according to the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
this level is expected to increase to two-thirds of the workforce by 2020 and could go even higher if more jobs are lost to the economic crisis and more migrants return home to informal sector jobs , said the oecd report " is informal normal ? " which was released on wednesday .
in comparison , 1.2 billion people are officially employed worldwide .
" even during good times with robust growth rates , in many developing countries informal employment increased in some regions , " said johannes jutting , one of the study 's authors .

jutting said nine out of 10 employees in india , or some 370 million people , did not have formal social security .
this informal employment had severe consequences for poverty in developing countries , the study said .
low pay , with no social benefits , increased the likelihood that the millennium development goal of halving poverty worldwide by 2015 would not be met .

a compromise is needed soon if a global action plan against climate change is to be signed at the copenhagen summit in december . eleven days of un-led climate talks in the german city of bonn have ended without making any visible progress toward a global action against climate change .
the talks , which included some 2,700 representatives from 180 countries , were the latest in a series of un-led meetings meant to forge a deal in copenhagen in december to replace or extend the kyoto protocol .
some participants said the deadlock at the bonn meeting was reminiscent of the chicken and egg problem .
industrialized and developing countries were loath to make concrete commitments and appeared to be waiting for the other side to make the first move .
the main quarrel , which also emerged again at the bonn meeting , was about carbon emission targets and financing the battle against climate change .
row over emission targets and funds " i would n't say these talks have been successful .
one of the things countries were supposed to agree on was an overall target for developed countries but this was not achieved .
so i would say we 're coming out of the negotiations with not much more than we went in with , " said stephanie tunmore , a climate campaigner for greenpeace international . developing countries had hoped the meeting would set a range of emissions reduction targets for the group of industrialized nations as a whole .
developed countries , however , preffered to procrastinate until other talks on technical issues were concluded , for example on how far they could offset their emissions and count the effect of planting trees .
us policy shift signals hope however , not all was gloom and doom in bonn .
delegates did give their general backing to some specific technical proposals , such as the formation of a registry to measure and reward climate action in developing countries , and delegates were also heartened by the more constructive approach taken by the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the previous us administration under george w. bush refused to sign the kyoto protocol " it was really refreshing to get this attitude from a us delegation that spent the last eight years stalling and refusing to act .
so i think you could definitely say that within the negotiations there has been a subtle change in atmosphere that even if they 're not actually doing the work yet , the trust is starting to get rebuilt , " said tunmore .
the united states ' commitments are considered key to climate negotiations , however , president barack obama 's fledgling administration has not made any specific pledges yet .
the european union plans to reduce greenhouse gases by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .
more ambitious carbon reduction targets needed but the united nations ' climate chief yvo de boer indicated during wednesday 's press conference in bonn that even these targets might not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's head of climate change yvo de boer is calling on industrialized nations to further cut greenhouse gases " the intergovernmental panel on climate change has indicated that if we want to avoid severe impact of climate change we need to be working towards industrialised country emission reductions in the order of minus 25-40 by 2020 , " de boer said .
" the numbers that have been discussed so far are still a significant distance from that range , so more ambition is needed on behalf of industrialised countries if we are to get a robust response to climate change . "
looking ahead to the copenhagen summit , de boer called for more clarity and commitment if a successful global deal on climate change was to be reached .
" firstly we need clarity on the individual emission reduction targets to be adopted by industrialised countries , secondly we need clarity on what major developing countries will do to limit the growth of their emissions , " said de boer .
developing countries bear the brunt the un climate chief added the copenhagen summit had to deliver clarity on finance .
developing countries were to receive financial support to allow them to engage on mitigation to limit the growth of their emissions .
however , de boer emphasised that it was just as important that developing countries received financial support in order to adapt to the impact of climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries are bearing the brunt of climate change which often results in drought and flooding environment and development groups have been urging swifter action for years .
many warn that unabated climate change will cause human suffering far worse than the present financial crisis .
developing countries are likely to bear the brunt since many are situated in areas where desertification and flooding already constitute signficant problems .
the next un climate gathering is scheduled for june .
that meeting marks a deadline to start formal negotiations .
de boer has said that a negotiating text would be on the table by then , enabling a successful conclusion of climate talks at the copenhagen summit in december . nk / th , dpa / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a compromise is needed soon if a global action plan against climate change is to be signed at the copenhagen summit in december . eleven days of un-led climate talks in the german city of bonn have ended without making any visible progress toward a global action against climate change .
the talks , which included some 2,700 representatives from 180 countries , were the latest in a series of un-led meetings meant to forge a deal in copenhagen in december to replace or extend the kyoto protocol .
some participants said the deadlock at the bonn meeting was reminiscent of the chicken and egg problem .
industrialized and developing countries were loath to make concrete commitments and appeared to be waiting for the other side to make the first move .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 08.04.2009 eu advances aid for developing nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large share of development aid goes towards food the european commission has outlined plans to bring forward development aid earmarked for later years .
but ngos say the measures are not sufficient to tackle the roots of poorer nations ' problems . the european union 's executive arm will pull forward aid to developing nations hard hit by the worldwide economic crisis .
" those least responsible for the financial crisis are among those worst hit by its economic effects , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
the european commission said it would bring forward 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in resources to 2009 previously earmarked to help poor countries fight a recession that has staunched credit flows , curtailed investment and sent a number of local currencies into a tailspin .
development commissioner louis michel said advancing money allowed the aid " to have an impact when it is most needed . "
the commission said it will speed up three billion euros , or 72 percent of its budget support to african , pacific and caribbean nations .
it will direct at least 500 million euros to support local welfare spending .
in addition , 800 million euros from an existing facility to combat hunger will be made available this year .
however , the eu will not provide additional funds .
" we did n't come here to announce to you any huge new sums , " michel said .
" of course our ambitions are limited .
but we are going to keep putting the pressure on . "
eu measures " an empty package " aid organizations , though , have criticized the eu plans .
the european ngo confederation for relief and development , concord , said the measures fell " far short " of what was needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change has hit developing nations particularly hard " less than one week after the g20 , the eu has produced a strategy that fails to address the underlying flaws in the system that we know fuel poverty in developing countries , " said concord 's eu policy officer ester asin-martinez .
the international anti-poverty agency actionaid said the plans left many issues open .
" we 're not clear on how europe is actually going to soften the blow of the financial crisis in poor countries , " alexandre polack , actionaid 's head of european policy , said in a statement .
polack said the package had little solutions to the problems faced by developing countries .
" we have not seen any useful ideas coming out of this package on how to support developing countries in dealing with climate change , on stopping tax evasion or on coping with the effects of trade policies , " polack said .
" the commission demonstrated its good intentions today , but what it is offering is effectively an empty package . "
by frontloading aid , the eu left open what would happen in subsequent years .
" we fear that with no new money , poor countries will suffer in years to come , when aid dries up , " said hetty kovach , oxfam international 's policy advisor on aid .
" europe needs to dig deep to help prevent this crisis from becoming a humanitarian disaster . "
aid must be a joint eu effort g20 leaders last week in london agreed on an international strategy to pull the global economy out of crisis , including new moves to help poor nations .
europe is the biggest aid donor in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel says europe can help in relieving human suffering " i am proud that europe is first to act after the g20 in support of developing countries , " michel said .
the commission said it would focus on three main measures : " first , keeping our promises , " second , paying more quickly old money earmarked last year for developing countries , and third , having the commission and member states work more closely together to be more efficient .
barroso said no country could hold back .
" the recession must not , can not and will not be used as an excuse for going back on our promises to keep on increasing aid , " barroso said .
aid from the 27 nation bloc rose to 49 billion euros last year .
but aid volumes will need to increase to some 69 billion euros in 2010 to meet interim aid spending targets , the commission said .
" we are now more than half way to the 2015 deadline for reaching the un millennium development goals and some of the gains achieved so far risk being forfeited , leaving poor countries worse off than before the crisis , " barroso said .

but ngos say the measures are not sufficient to tackle the roots of poorer nations ' problems . the european union 's executive arm will pull forward aid to developing nations hard hit by the worldwide economic crisis .
" those least responsible for the financial crisis are among those worst hit by its economic effects , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
the european commission said it would bring forward 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in resources to 2009 previously earmarked to help poor countries fight a recession that has staunched credit flows , curtailed investment and sent a number of local currencies into a tailspin .
development commissioner louis michel said advancing money allowed the aid " to have an impact when it is most needed . "
the commission said it will speed up three billion euros , or 72 percent of its budget support to african , pacific and caribbean nations .
it will direct at least 500 million euros to support local welfare spending .
in addition , 800 million euros from an existing facility to combat hunger will be made available this year .
however , the eu will not provide additional funds .
" we did n't come here to announce to you any huge new sums , " michel said .
" of course our ambitions are limited .
but we are going to keep putting the pressure on . "
eu measures " an empty package " aid organizations , though , have criticized the eu plans .
the european ngo confederation for relief and development , concord , said the measures fell " far short " of what was needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change has hit developing nations particularly hard " less than one week after the g20 , the eu has produced a strategy that fails to address the underlying flaws in the system that we know fuel poverty in developing countries , " said concord 's eu policy officer ester asin-martinez .
the international anti-poverty agency actionaid said the plans left many issues open .
" we 're not clear on how europe is actually going to soften the blow of the financial crisis in poor countries , " alexandre polack , actionaid 's head of european policy , said in a statement .
polack said the package had little solutions to the problems faced by developing countries .
" we have not seen any useful ideas coming out of this package on how to support developing countries in dealing with climate change , on stopping tax evasion or on coping with the effects of trade policies , " polack said .
" the commission demonstrated its good intentions today , but what it is offering is effectively an empty package . "
by frontloading aid , the eu left open what would happen in subsequent years .
" we fear that with no new money , poor countries will suffer in years to come , when aid dries up , " said hetty kovach , oxfam international 's policy advisor on aid .
" europe needs to dig deep to help prevent this crisis from becoming a humanitarian disaster . "
aid must be a joint eu effort g20 leaders last week in london agreed on an international strategy to pull the global economy out of crisis , including new moves to help poor nations .
europe is the biggest aid donor in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel says europe can help in relieving human suffering " i am proud that europe is first to act after the g20 in support of developing countries , " michel said .
the commission said it would focus on three main measures : " first , keeping our promises , " second , paying more quickly old money earmarked last year for developing countries , and third , having the commission and member states work more closely together to be more efficient .
barroso said no country could hold back .
" the recession must not , can not and will not be used as an excuse for going back on our promises to keep on increasing aid , " barroso said .
aid from the 27 nation bloc rose to 49 billion euros last year .
but aid volumes will need to increase to some 69 billion euros in 2010 to meet interim aid spending targets , the commission said .
" we are now more than half way to the 2015 deadline for reaching the un millennium development goals and some of the gains achieved so far risk being forfeited , leaving poor countries worse off than before the crisis , " barroso said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 08.04.2009 eu advances aid for developing nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large share of development aid goes towards food the european commission has outlined plans to bring forward development aid earmarked for later years .
but ngos say the measures are not sufficient to tackle the roots of poorer nations ' problems . the european union 's executive arm will pull forward aid to developing nations hard hit by the worldwide economic crisis .
" those least responsible for the financial crisis are among those worst hit by its economic effects , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
the european commission said it would bring forward 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in resources to 2009 previously earmarked to help poor countries fight a recession that has staunched credit flows , curtailed investment and sent a number of local currencies into a tailspin .
development commissioner louis michel said advancing money allowed the aid " to have an impact when it is most needed . "
the commission said it will speed up three billion euros , or 72 percent of its budget support to african , pacific and caribbean nations .
it will direct at least 500 million euros to support local welfare spending .
in addition , 800 million euros from an existing facility to combat hunger will be made available this year .
however , the eu will not provide additional funds .
" we did n't come here to announce to you any huge new sums , " michel said .
" of course our ambitions are limited .
but we are going to keep putting the pressure on . "
eu measures " an empty package " aid organizations , though , have criticized the eu plans .
the european ngo confederation for relief and development , concord , said the measures fell " far short " of what was needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change has hit developing nations particularly hard " less than one week after the g20 , the eu has produced a strategy that fails to address the underlying flaws in the system that we know fuel poverty in developing countries , " said concord 's eu policy officer ester asin-martinez .
the international anti-poverty agency actionaid said the plans left many issues open .
" we 're not clear on how europe is actually going to soften the blow of the financial crisis in poor countries , " alexandre polack , actionaid 's head of european policy , said in a statement .
polack said the package had little solutions to the problems faced by developing countries .
" we have not seen any useful ideas coming out of this package on how to support developing countries in dealing with climate change , on stopping tax evasion or on coping with the effects of trade policies , " polack said .
" the commission demonstrated its good intentions today , but what it is offering is effectively an empty package . "
by frontloading aid , the eu left open what would happen in subsequent years .
" we fear that with no new money , poor countries will suffer in years to come , when aid dries up , " said hetty kovach , oxfam international 's policy advisor on aid .
" europe needs to dig deep to help prevent this crisis from becoming a humanitarian disaster . "
aid must be a joint eu effort g20 leaders last week in london agreed on an international strategy to pull the global economy out of crisis , including new moves to help poor nations .
europe is the biggest aid donor in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel says europe can help in relieving human suffering " i am proud that europe is first to act after the g20 in support of developing countries , " michel said .
the commission said it would focus on three main measures : " first , keeping our promises , " second , paying more quickly old money earmarked last year for developing countries , and third , having the commission and member states work more closely together to be more efficient .
barroso said no country could hold back .
" the recession must not , can not and will not be used as an excuse for going back on our promises to keep on increasing aid , " barroso said .
aid from the 27 nation bloc rose to 49 billion euros last year .
but aid volumes will need to increase to some 69 billion euros in 2010 to meet interim aid spending targets , the commission said .
" we are now more than half way to the 2015 deadline for reaching the un millennium development goals and some of the gains achieved so far risk being forfeited , leaving poor countries worse off than before the crisis , " barroso said .
world leaders of 189 countries agreed on the so-called millennium development goals in 2000 .
they consist of eight targets for reducing poverty by 2015 - including halving the number of people living on less than $ 1 a day . sac / rm , reuters / afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .
the violence seemed to erupt from nowhere , but the protests that rocked moldova reflected tensions that have long been simmering in a poor corner of europe perched on the east-west fault line .
" the deeper causes go back to questions of identity and what moldova 's future is , " samuel greene , deputy director at the carnegie center in moscow , told deutsche welle .
" moldova is still suffering from the aftermath of a civil war and it does n't have full sovereignty over its territory .
in addition , in order to keep the peace voronin has struck a compromise with russia by which it promises basically not to move towards unification with romania , which was being discussed at some point ; it promises to really not look that seriously at european union membership and certainly not to look at nato membership . "
compromises hinder moldovan progress , say critics greene believes that many moldovans accuse the communist government 's compliance with russian demands of holding the country back and that has led , to a certain degree , to the violent protests .
" these compromises have closed off socio-economic prospects for a large part of the moldovan population that really did n't have a hand in making those compromises and did n't necessarily approve of those compromises , " he said .
" when the ruling group that had made those compromises and essentially closed that door for moldova announces that it is trying to stay in power indefinitely and at any cost and any means , it can lead to a certain amount of emotion and maybe even desperation .
what we 're seeing now is a sort of ' now or never ' situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 demonstrators stormed the palace and parliament with voronin 's communist party likely to remain in power despite doubts over the validity of the vote , there is concern that the protests could continue and even escalate .
however , greene believes that moldova has seen enough violence .
" i do n't think that we would see the return to violence and civil war , " he said .
" i think most people in moldova have been fairly shocked by the violence of these protests and have seemed not to have approved of that degree of violence .
i think that if there are further protests they are likely to a lot more peaceful . "
president 's balancing act causing frustration many experts think that the reasons for the sudden outbursts can be traced to the complicated relationship , cultivated by voronin , between moldova , the eu and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has made concessions to russia voronin , a soviet-era interior minister for moldova , has in recent years reinvented himself as " pro-eu " leader interested in forging strong ties with the west .
under his leadership , moldova has implemented the first three-year action plan within the framework of the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- which precedes accession talks .
and the eu , pushed in particular by its newest members from the former soviet bloc in eastern europe , has supported voronin , promising as recently as october to seal a " new and ambitious " relationship with moldova .
a year earlier , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia issued a joint statement pushing the eu to " acknowledge the pace of progress , moldova 's efforts and concrete achievements " under voronin 's leadership .
while turning to the west , voronin has also managed to keep relations with moscow - the supporter of the rebel transnistra region in eastern moldova - on a very warm track , also with support from the russian side .
moldova standing at east-west crossroads with voronin courting both brussels and moscow , and both sides reciprocating his overtures , each anxious not to cede dominant influence to the other , the stage was set for some kind of rupture within the country itself .
many moldovans believe that their country is going to have to make a choice : is it with europe or is it with russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has positioned moldova between the eu and russia " well , it 's a balancing act and to be honest , russia is incredibly important for moldova 's stability because it does control the fate of the breakaway republican interests in transnistra and it 's also important for moldova 's economy , " greene said .
" moldova 's economy depends tremendously on remittances from moldovans working abroad - a large number of those are in russia - and so that is obviously important to any moldovan government .
" but a large number of those workers are in europe and europe is a significantly more lucrative place for them to be than in russia , " he added .
" it is also impossible for any moldovan government to entirely close the door on europe .
but what voronin has tried to do is this balancing act which over time evolves basically into institutionalized indecisiveness that says ' we 're not going to move in any direction ' and that makes it very difficult for foreigners to invest in moldova and for people to develop the economy when you have no idea what the long term prospects for the country are . "
the eu will on may 7 launch the so-called " eastern partnership " program of closer ties with moldova along with ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan , armenia , and belarus .
the plan envisages aid , the gradual creation of a free trade zone and better energy ties .
the eu will also negotiate accords setting terms for cooperation in reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
will these initiatives sway the communists towards europe or lead to another power struggle to join the many that have gone before it in moldova 's history ?
how the new moldovan government and its russian overseers respond to these developments , only time will tell .

but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .
the violence seemed to erupt from nowhere , but the protests that rocked moldova reflected tensions that have long been simmering in a poor corner of europe perched on the east-west fault line .
" the deeper causes go back to questions of identity and what moldova 's future is , " samuel greene , deputy director at the carnegie center in moscow , told deutsche welle .
" moldova is still suffering from the aftermath of a civil war and it does n't have full sovereignty over its territory .
in addition , in order to keep the peace voronin has struck a compromise with russia by which it promises basically not to move towards unification with romania , which was being discussed at some point ; it promises to really not look that seriously at european union membership and certainly not to look at nato membership . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 08.04.2009 unrest in moldova brings complicated state into international focus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-communist protests have dragged moldova into the spotlight the current unrest in moldova over disputed election results has turned the international spotlight on the small former soviet state and its complicated relationship with europe and russia . for a lot of people , it is the first time that this complicated country has entered the modern consciousness .
but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .
the violence seemed to erupt from nowhere , but the protests that rocked moldova reflected tensions that have long been simmering in a poor corner of europe perched on the east-west fault line .
" the deeper causes go back to questions of identity and what moldova 's future is , " samuel greene , deputy director at the carnegie center in moscow , told deutsche welle .
" moldova is still suffering from the aftermath of a civil war and it does n't have full sovereignty over its territory .
in addition , in order to keep the peace voronin has struck a compromise with russia by which it promises basically not to move towards unification with romania , which was being discussed at some point ; it promises to really not look that seriously at european union membership and certainly not to look at nato membership . "
compromises hinder moldovan progress , say critics greene believes that many moldovans accuse the communist government 's compliance with russian demands of holding the country back and that has led , to a certain degree , to the violent protests .
" these compromises have closed off socio-economic prospects for a large part of the moldovan population that really did n't have a hand in making those compromises and did n't necessarily approve of those compromises , " he said .
" when the ruling group that had made those compromises and essentially closed that door for moldova announces that it is trying to stay in power indefinitely and at any cost and any means , it can lead to a certain amount of emotion and maybe even desperation .
what we 're seeing now is a sort of ' now or never ' situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 demonstrators stormed the palace and parliament with voronin 's communist party likely to remain in power despite doubts over the validity of the vote , there is concern that the protests could continue and even escalate .
however , greene believes that moldova has seen enough violence .
" i do n't think that we would see the return to violence and civil war , " he said .
" i think most people in moldova have been fairly shocked by the violence of these protests and have seemed not to have approved of that degree of violence .
i think that if there are further protests they are likely to a lot more peaceful . "
president 's balancing act causing frustration many experts think that the reasons for the sudden outbursts can be traced to the complicated relationship , cultivated by voronin , between moldova , the eu and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has made concessions to russia voronin , a soviet-era interior minister for moldova , has in recent years reinvented himself as " pro-eu " leader interested in forging strong ties with the west .
under his leadership , moldova has implemented the first three-year action plan within the framework of the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- which precedes accession talks .
and the eu , pushed in particular by its newest members from the former soviet bloc in eastern europe , has supported voronin , promising as recently as october to seal a " new and ambitious " relationship with moldova .
a year earlier , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia issued a joint statement pushing the eu to " acknowledge the pace of progress , moldova 's efforts and concrete achievements " under voronin 's leadership .
while turning to the west , voronin has also managed to keep relations with moscow - the supporter of the rebel transnistra region in eastern moldova - on a very warm track , also with support from the russian side .
moldova standing at east-west crossroads with voronin courting both brussels and moscow , and both sides reciprocating his overtures , each anxious not to cede dominant influence to the other , the stage was set for some kind of rupture within the country itself .
many moldovans believe that their country is going to have to make a choice : is it with europe or is it with russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has positioned moldova between the eu and russia " well , it 's a balancing act and to be honest , russia is incredibly important for moldova 's stability because it does control the fate of the breakaway republican interests in transnistra and it 's also important for moldova 's economy , " greene said .
" moldova 's economy depends tremendously on remittances from moldovans working abroad - a large number of those are in russia - and so that is obviously important to any moldovan government .
" but a large number of those workers are in europe and europe is a significantly more lucrative place for them to be than in russia , " he added .
" it is also impossible for any moldovan government to entirely close the door on europe .

but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .
the violence seemed to erupt from nowhere , but the protests that rocked moldova reflected tensions that have long been simmering in a poor corner of europe perched on the east-west fault line .
" the deeper causes go back to questions of identity and what moldova 's future is , " samuel greene , deputy director at the carnegie center in moscow , told deutsche welle .
" moldova is still suffering from the aftermath of a civil war and it does n't have full sovereignty over its territory .
in addition , in order to keep the peace voronin has struck a compromise with russia by which it promises basically not to move towards unification with romania , which was being discussed at some point ; it promises to really not look that seriously at european union membership and certainly not to look at nato membership . "
compromises hinder moldovan progress , say critics greene believes that many moldovans accuse the communist government 's compliance with russian demands of holding the country back and that has led , to a certain degree , to the violent protests .
" these compromises have closed off socio-economic prospects for a large part of the moldovan population that really did n't have a hand in making those compromises and did n't necessarily approve of those compromises , " he said .
" when the ruling group that had made those compromises and essentially closed that door for moldova announces that it is trying to stay in power indefinitely and at any cost and any means , it can lead to a certain amount of emotion and maybe even desperation .
what we 're seeing now is a sort of ' now or never ' situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 demonstrators stormed the palace and parliament with voronin 's communist party likely to remain in power despite doubts over the validity of the vote , there is concern that the protests could continue and even escalate .
however , greene believes that moldova has seen enough violence .
" i do n't think that we would see the return to violence and civil war , " he said .
" i think most people in moldova have been fairly shocked by the violence of these protests and have seemed not to have approved of that degree of violence .
i think that if there are further protests they are likely to a lot more peaceful . "
president 's balancing act causing frustration many experts think that the reasons for the sudden outbursts can be traced to the complicated relationship , cultivated by voronin , between moldova , the eu and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has made concessions to russia voronin , a soviet-era interior minister for moldova , has in recent years reinvented himself as " pro-eu " leader interested in forging strong ties with the west .
under his leadership , moldova has implemented the first three-year action plan within the framework of the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- which precedes accession talks .
and the eu , pushed in particular by its newest members from the former soviet bloc in eastern europe , has supported voronin , promising as recently as october to seal a " new and ambitious " relationship with moldova .
a year earlier , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia issued a joint statement pushing the eu to " acknowledge the pace of progress , moldova 's efforts and concrete achievements " under voronin 's leadership .
while turning to the west , voronin has also managed to keep relations with moscow - the supporter of the rebel transnistra region in eastern moldova - on a very warm track , also with support from the russian side .
moldova standing at east-west crossroads with voronin courting both brussels and moscow , and both sides reciprocating his overtures , each anxious not to cede dominant influence to the other , the stage was set for some kind of rupture within the country itself .
many moldovans believe that their country is going to have to make a choice : is it with europe or is it with russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has positioned moldova between the eu and russia " well , it 's a balancing act and to be honest , russia is incredibly important for moldova 's stability because it does control the fate of the breakaway republican interests in transnistra and it 's also important for moldova 's economy , " greene said .
" moldova 's economy depends tremendously on remittances from moldovans working abroad - a large number of those are in russia - and so that is obviously important to any moldovan government .
" but a large number of those workers are in europe and europe is a significantly more lucrative place for them to be than in russia , " he added .
" it is also impossible for any moldovan government to entirely close the door on europe .
but what voronin has tried to do is this balancing act which over time evolves basically into institutionalized indecisiveness that says ' we 're not going to move in any direction ' and that makes it very difficult for foreigners to invest in moldova and for people to develop the economy when you have no idea what the long term prospects for the country are . "
the eu will on may 7 launch the so-called " eastern partnership " program of closer ties with moldova along with ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan , armenia , and belarus .
the plan envisages aid , the gradual creation of a free trade zone and better energy ties .
the eu will also negotiate accords setting terms for cooperation in reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
will these initiatives sway the communists towards europe or lead to another power struggle to join the many that have gone before it in moldova 's history ?
how the new moldovan government and its russian overseers respond to these developments , only time will tell .

but , management insists that the company is still economically viable . management for the convertible specialist filed papers for receivership on wednesday at an osnabrueck district court saying the company faced bankruptcy due to financial obligations related to an employee social plan worked out with the trade union .
representatives for the metalworkers ' union said karmann was planning to cut 1,340 jobs because of a lack of clients amid the global slump in demand for cars .
the loss of business , the company said , was making it impossible to finance planned layoffs as part of a company restructuring to cope with the global economic downturn .
the union said the essential reason for the financial shortfall was the shutdown of the car assembly unit .
karmann also used to do assembly work for renault , volkswagen and mercedes , which have all been hit by the crisis , and will now focus on building car parts , the company said .
karmann said the company was still economically viable and practically free of debt .
court receivership , a statement said , would allow the company to revamp its business model and save as many jobs as possible . gb / pfd , dpa / ap / rtrd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in developing countries with no unemployment insurance , they are now forced to work in positions with low pay and no protection , an oecd study says . some 1.8 billion people , or more than half of the global labor force , are working without formal contracts and social security , according to the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
this level is expected to increase to two-thirds of the workforce by 2020 and could go even higher if more jobs are lost to the economic crisis and more migrants return home to informal sector jobs , said the oecd report " is informal normal ? " which was released on wednesday .
in comparison , 1.2 billion people are officially employed worldwide .
" even during good times with robust growth rates , in many developing countries informal employment increased in some regions , " said johannes jutting , one of the study 's authors .
" though india grew during the last decade above five percentage points per year , people there feel better jobs are not being created . "
jutting said nine out of 10 employees in india , or some 370 million people , did not have formal social security .
this informal employment had severe consequences for poverty in developing countries , the study said .
low pay , with no social benefits , increased the likelihood that the millennium development goal of halving poverty worldwide by 2015 would not be met .
the oecd said " immediate and unconventional action " was urgently needed .
it said measures were necessary to improve infrastructure , help develop skills , promote institutional reform and increase access to resources for informal businesses both in the formal and informal employment sectors .

a compromise is needed soon if a global action plan against climate change is to be signed at the copenhagen summit in december . eleven days of un-led climate talks in the german city of bonn have ended without making any visible progress toward a global action against climate change .
the talks , which included some 2,700 representatives from 180 countries , were the latest in a series of un-led meetings meant to forge a deal in copenhagen in december to replace or extend the kyoto protocol .
some participants said the deadlock at the bonn meeting was reminiscent of the chicken and egg problem .
industrialized and developing countries were loath to make concrete commitments and appeared to be waiting for the other side to make the first move .
the main quarrel , which also emerged again at the bonn meeting , was about carbon emission targets and financing the battle against climate change .
row over emission targets and funds " i would n't say these talks have been successful .
one of the things countries were supposed to agree on was an overall target for developed countries but this was not achieved .
so i would say we 're coming out of the negotiations with not much more than we went in with , " said stephanie tunmore , a climate campaigner for greenpeace international . developing countries had hoped the meeting would set a range of emissions reduction targets for the group of industrialized nations as a whole .
developed countries , however , preffered to procrastinate until other talks on technical issues were concluded , for example on how far they could offset their emissions and count the effect of planting trees .
us policy shift signals hope however , not all was gloom and doom in bonn .
delegates did give their general backing to some specific technical proposals , such as the formation of a registry to measure and reward climate action in developing countries , and delegates were also heartened by the more constructive approach taken by the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the previous us administration under george w. bush refused to sign the kyoto protocol " it was really refreshing to get this attitude from a us delegation that spent the last eight years stalling and refusing to act .
so i think you could definitely say that within the negotiations there has been a subtle change in atmosphere that even if they 're not actually doing the work yet , the trust is starting to get rebuilt , " said tunmore .
the united states ' commitments are considered key to climate negotiations , however , president barack obama 's fledgling administration has not made any specific pledges yet .
the european union plans to reduce greenhouse gases by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .
more ambitious carbon reduction targets needed but the united nations ' climate chief yvo de boer indicated during wednesday 's press conference in bonn that even these targets might not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's head of climate change yvo de boer is calling on industrialized nations to further cut greenhouse gases " the intergovernmental panel on climate change has indicated that if we want to avoid severe impact of climate change we need to be working towards industrialised country emission reductions in the order of minus 25-40 by 2020 , " de boer said .
" the numbers that have been discussed so far are still a significant distance from that range , so more ambition is needed on behalf of industrialised countries if we are to get a robust response to climate change . "
looking ahead to the copenhagen summit , de boer called for more clarity and commitment if a successful global deal on climate change was to be reached .
" firstly we need clarity on the individual emission reduction targets to be adopted by industrialised countries , secondly we need clarity on what major developing countries will do to limit the growth of their emissions , " said de boer .
developing countries bear the brunt the un climate chief added the copenhagen summit had to deliver clarity on finance .
developing countries were to receive financial support to allow them to engage on mitigation to limit the growth of their emissions .
however , de boer emphasised that it was just as important that developing countries received financial support in order to adapt to the impact of climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries are bearing the brunt of climate change which often results in drought and flooding environment and development groups have been urging swifter action for years .
many warn that unabated climate change will cause human suffering far worse than the present financial crisis .
developing countries are likely to bear the brunt since many are situated in areas where desertification and flooding already constitute signficant problems .
the next un climate gathering is scheduled for june .
that meeting marks a deadline to start formal negotiations .
de boer has said that a negotiating text would be on the table by then , enabling a successful conclusion of climate talks at the copenhagen summit in december . nk / th , dpa / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a compromise is needed soon if a global action plan against climate change is to be signed at the copenhagen summit in december . eleven days of un-led climate talks in the german city of bonn have ended without making any visible progress toward a global action against climate change .
the talks , which included some 2,700 representatives from 180 countries , were the latest in a series of un-led meetings meant to forge a deal in copenhagen in december to replace or extend the kyoto protocol .
some participants said the deadlock at the bonn meeting was reminiscent of the chicken and egg problem .

" the numbers that have been discussed so far are still a significant distance from that range , so more ambition is needed on behalf of industrialised countries if we are to get a robust response to climate change . "
looking ahead to the copenhagen summit , de boer called for more clarity and commitment if a successful global deal on climate change was to be reached .
" firstly we need clarity on the individual emission reduction targets to be adopted by industrialised countries , secondly we need clarity on what major developing countries will do to limit the growth of their emissions , " said de boer .

a compromise is needed soon if a global action plan against climate change is to be signed at the copenhagen summit in december . eleven days of un-led climate talks in the german city of bonn have ended without making any visible progress toward a global action against climate change .
the talks , which included some 2,700 representatives from 180 countries , were the latest in a series of un-led meetings meant to forge a deal in copenhagen in december to replace or extend the kyoto protocol .
some participants said the deadlock at the bonn meeting was reminiscent of the chicken and egg problem .
industrialized and developing countries were loath to make concrete commitments and appeared to be waiting for the other side to make the first move .
the main quarrel , which also emerged again at the bonn meeting , was about carbon emission targets and financing the battle against climate change .
row over emission targets and funds " i would n't say these talks have been successful .
one of the things countries were supposed to agree on was an overall target for developed countries but this was not achieved .
so i would say we 're coming out of the negotiations with not much more than we went in with , " said stephanie tunmore , a climate campaigner for greenpeace international . developing countries had hoped the meeting would set a range of emissions reduction targets for the group of industrialized nations as a whole .
developed countries , however , preffered to procrastinate until other talks on technical issues were concluded , for example on how far they could offset their emissions and count the effect of planting trees .
us policy shift signals hope however , not all was gloom and doom in bonn .
delegates did give their general backing to some specific technical proposals , such as the formation of a registry to measure and reward climate action in developing countries , and delegates were also heartened by the more constructive approach taken by the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the previous us administration under george w. bush refused to sign the kyoto protocol " it was really refreshing to get this attitude from a us delegation that spent the last eight years stalling and refusing to act .
so i think you could definitely say that within the negotiations there has been a subtle change in atmosphere that even if they 're not actually doing the work yet , the trust is starting to get rebuilt , " said tunmore .
the united states ' commitments are considered key to climate negotiations , however , president barack obama 's fledgling administration has not made any specific pledges yet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 08.04.2009 eu advances aid for developing nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large share of development aid goes towards food the european commission has outlined plans to bring forward development aid earmarked for later years .
but ngos say the measures are not sufficient to tackle the roots of poorer nations ' problems . the european union 's executive arm will pull forward aid to developing nations hard hit by the worldwide economic crisis .
" those least responsible for the financial crisis are among those worst hit by its economic effects , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
the european commission said it would bring forward 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in resources to 2009 previously earmarked to help poor countries fight a recession that has staunched credit flows , curtailed investment and sent a number of local currencies into a tailspin .
development commissioner louis michel said advancing money allowed the aid " to have an impact when it is most needed . "
the commission said it will speed up three billion euros , or 72 percent of its budget support to african , pacific and caribbean nations .
it will direct at least 500 million euros to support local welfare spending .
in addition , 800 million euros from an existing facility to combat hunger will be made available this year .
however , the eu will not provide additional funds .
" we did n't come here to announce to you any huge new sums , " michel said .
" of course our ambitions are limited .
but we are going to keep putting the pressure on . "
eu measures " an empty package " aid organizations , though , have criticized the eu plans .
the european ngo confederation for relief and development , concord , said the measures fell " far short " of what was needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change has hit developing nations particularly hard " less than one week after the g20 , the eu has produced a strategy that fails to address the underlying flaws in the system that we know fuel poverty in developing countries , " said concord 's eu policy officer ester asin-martinez .
the international anti-poverty agency actionaid said the plans left many issues open .
" we 're not clear on how europe is actually going to soften the blow of the financial crisis in poor countries , " alexandre polack , actionaid 's head of european policy , said in a statement .
polack said the package had little solutions to the problems faced by developing countries .
" we have not seen any useful ideas coming out of this package on how to support developing countries in dealing with climate change , on stopping tax evasion or on coping with the effects of trade policies , " polack said .
" the commission demonstrated its good intentions today , but what it is offering is effectively an empty package . "
by frontloading aid , the eu left open what would happen in subsequent years .
" we fear that with no new money , poor countries will suffer in years to come , when aid dries up , " said hetty kovach , oxfam international 's policy advisor on aid .
" europe needs to dig deep to help prevent this crisis from becoming a humanitarian disaster . "
aid must be a joint eu effort g20 leaders last week in london agreed on an international strategy to pull the global economy out of crisis , including new moves to help poor nations .
europe is the biggest aid donor in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel says europe can help in relieving human suffering " i am proud that europe is first to act after the g20 in support of developing countries , " michel said .
the commission said it would focus on three main measures : " first , keeping our promises , " second , paying more quickly old money earmarked last year for developing countries , and third , having the commission and member states work more closely together to be more efficient .
barroso said no country could hold back .
" the recession must not , can not and will not be used as an excuse for going back on our promises to keep on increasing aid , " barroso said .
aid from the 27 nation bloc rose to 49 billion euros last year .
but aid volumes will need to increase to some 69 billion euros in 2010 to meet interim aid spending targets , the commission said .
" we are now more than half way to the 2015 deadline for reaching the un millennium development goals and some of the gains achieved so far risk being forfeited , leaving poor countries worse off than before the crisis , " barroso said .
world leaders of 189 countries agreed on the so-called millennium development goals in 2000 .
they consist of eight targets for reducing poverty by 2015 - including halving the number of people living on less than $ 1 a day . sac / rm , reuters / afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but ngos say the measures are not sufficient to tackle the roots of poorer nations ' problems . the european union 's executive arm will pull forward aid to developing nations hard hit by the worldwide economic crisis .
" those least responsible for the financial crisis are among those worst hit by its economic effects , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
the european commission said it would bring forward 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in resources to 2009 previously earmarked to help poor countries fight a recession that has staunched credit flows , curtailed investment and sent a number of local currencies into a tailspin .
development commissioner louis michel said advancing money allowed the aid " to have an impact when it is most needed . "
the commission said it will speed up three billion euros , or 72 percent of its budget support to african , pacific and caribbean nations .
it will direct at least 500 million euros to support local welfare spending .
in addition , 800 million euros from an existing facility to combat hunger will be made available this year .
however , the eu will not provide additional funds .
" we did n't come here to announce to you any huge new sums , " michel said .
" of course our ambitions are limited .
but we are going to keep putting the pressure on . "
eu measures " an empty package " aid organizations , though , have criticized the eu plans .
the european ngo confederation for relief and development , concord , said the measures fell " far short " of what was needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change has hit developing nations particularly hard " less than one week after the g20 , the eu has produced a strategy that fails to address the underlying flaws in the system that we know fuel poverty in developing countries , " said concord 's eu policy officer ester asin-martinez .
the international anti-poverty agency actionaid said the plans left many issues open .
" we 're not clear on how europe is actually going to soften the blow of the financial crisis in poor countries , " alexandre polack , actionaid 's head of european policy , said in a statement .
polack said the package had little solutions to the problems faced by developing countries .
" we have not seen any useful ideas coming out of this package on how to support developing countries in dealing with climate change , on stopping tax evasion or on coping with the effects of trade policies , " polack said .
" the commission demonstrated its good intentions today , but what it is offering is effectively an empty package . "
by frontloading aid , the eu left open what would happen in subsequent years .
" we fear that with no new money , poor countries will suffer in years to come , when aid dries up , " said hetty kovach , oxfam international 's policy advisor on aid .
" europe needs to dig deep to help prevent this crisis from becoming a humanitarian disaster . "
aid must be a joint eu effort g20 leaders last week in london agreed on an international strategy to pull the global economy out of crisis , including new moves to help poor nations .
europe is the biggest aid donor in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel says europe can help in relieving human suffering " i am proud that europe is first to act after the g20 in support of developing countries , " michel said .
the commission said it would focus on three main measures : " first , keeping our promises , " second , paying more quickly old money earmarked last year for developing countries , and third , having the commission and member states work more closely together to be more efficient .
barroso said no country could hold back .
" the recession must not , can not and will not be used as an excuse for going back on our promises to keep on increasing aid , " barroso said .
aid from the 27 nation bloc rose to 49 billion euros last year .
but aid volumes will need to increase to some 69 billion euros in 2010 to meet interim aid spending targets , the commission said .
" we are now more than half way to the 2015 deadline for reaching the un millennium development goals and some of the gains achieved so far risk being forfeited , leaving poor countries worse off than before the crisis , " barroso said .
world leaders of 189 countries agreed on the so-called millennium development goals in 2000 .

but ngos say the measures are not sufficient to tackle the roots of poorer nations ' problems . the european union 's executive arm will pull forward aid to developing nations hard hit by the worldwide economic crisis .
" those least responsible for the financial crisis are among those worst hit by its economic effects , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
the european commission said it would bring forward 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in resources to 2009 previously earmarked to help poor countries fight a recession that has staunched credit flows , curtailed investment and sent a number of local currencies into a tailspin .
development commissioner louis michel said advancing money allowed the aid " to have an impact when it is most needed . "
the commission said it will speed up three billion euros , or 72 percent of its budget support to african , pacific and caribbean nations .
it will direct at least 500 million euros to support local welfare spending .
in addition , 800 million euros from an existing facility to combat hunger will be made available this year .
however , the eu will not provide additional funds .
" we did n't come here to announce to you any huge new sums , " michel said .
" of course our ambitions are limited .
but we are going to keep putting the pressure on . "
eu measures " an empty package " aid organizations , though , have criticized the eu plans .
the european ngo confederation for relief and development , concord , said the measures fell " far short " of what was needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change has hit developing nations particularly hard " less than one week after the g20 , the eu has produced a strategy that fails to address the underlying flaws in the system that we know fuel poverty in developing countries , " said concord 's eu policy officer ester asin-martinez .
the international anti-poverty agency actionaid said the plans left many issues open .
" we 're not clear on how europe is actually going to soften the blow of the financial crisis in poor countries , " alexandre polack , actionaid 's head of european policy , said in a statement .
polack said the package had little solutions to the problems faced by developing countries .
" we have not seen any useful ideas coming out of this package on how to support developing countries in dealing with climate change , on stopping tax evasion or on coping with the effects of trade policies , " polack said .
" the commission demonstrated its good intentions today , but what it is offering is effectively an empty package . "
by frontloading aid , the eu left open what would happen in subsequent years .
" we fear that with no new money , poor countries will suffer in years to come , when aid dries up , " said hetty kovach , oxfam international 's policy advisor on aid .
" europe needs to dig deep to help prevent this crisis from becoming a humanitarian disaster . "
aid must be a joint eu effort g20 leaders last week in london agreed on an international strategy to pull the global economy out of crisis , including new moves to help poor nations .
europe is the biggest aid donor in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel says europe can help in relieving human suffering " i am proud that europe is first to act after the g20 in support of developing countries , " michel said .
the commission said it would focus on three main measures : " first , keeping our promises , " second , paying more quickly old money earmarked last year for developing countries , and third , having the commission and member states work more closely together to be more efficient .
barroso said no country could hold back .
" the recession must not , can not and will not be used as an excuse for going back on our promises to keep on increasing aid , " barroso said .
aid from the 27 nation bloc rose to 49 billion euros last year .
but aid volumes will need to increase to some 69 billion euros in 2010 to meet interim aid spending targets , the commission said .
" we are now more than half way to the 2015 deadline for reaching the un millennium development goals and some of the gains achieved so far risk being forfeited , leaving poor countries worse off than before the crisis , " barroso said .
world leaders of 189 countries agreed on the so-called millennium development goals in 2000 .

" the subsidy has proven to be an especially successful instrument , " wilhelm said , referring to the 40 percent rise in car sales observed in march . " for this reason the coalition has agreed to an extension and an increase in funds . " the trade-in scheme is part of government stimulus package aimed at shoring up the economy in the face of a global downturn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is giving consumers 2,500 good reasons to scrap their old car and buy a new one it offers german car owners a government bonus of 2,500 euros for scrapping vehicles older than nine years and replacing them with new fuel-efficient models . more than a million german car owners have already applied for the subsidy , far exceeding government expectations of the scheme , which was originally intended to accommodate a maximum of 600,000 consumers . by more than tripling the funds earmarked for bonus payments , the scheme can now accommodate up to two million consumers . negative side effects ? while the government praises its car-scrapping premium as a great success , critics argue that the negative side-effects of the scheme are being overlooked .
these include falling sales at car parts retailers , auto repair shops and used-car dealers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the scheme does not benefit high-end german brands other detractors point out that small carmakers , especially from asia , have benefitted most from the incentive plan , while major german luxury brands , such as daimler and bmw , have reaped little reward . some members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union had opposed extending the bonus payments on cost grounds , warning that pumping more money into the scheme would only prolong germany 's worst economic downturn since world war ii . economic stimulus measures introduced by the german government are already expected to create 40-50 billion euros of new debt this year . but with some 40 million motorists driving to the polls for national elections in september , it seems few leading politicians in berlin are willing to oppose such a popular subsidy scheme . sje / pfd , dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germans use up car-scrap bonus after just two months the 1.5 billion euros that germany set aside for a car-wreckage incentive have been used up , in just two months .
berlin has said it will extend the program , which is aimed at sparking new-car sales .

moldovan riot police have regained control of the president ’ s office and parliament building after they were ransacked by protesters claiming last weekend 's elections were rigged . witnesses in the capital , chisinau , said an estimated 100 riot police surrounded the buildings early on wednesday , but not before protesters had stormed them , setting fire to furniture and tossing computers out of the windows . interior ministry spokeswoman ala meleca said police arrested 193 people on charges of hooliganism and robbery , following the protests against the ruling communist party 's victory in weekend elections .

opposition calls for a recount of the vote were dismissed by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , who said the demands were “ absolutely groundless . ”
lavrov stressed that international observers from both western european bodies and a bloc of former soviet states led by russia had endorsed the moldovan vote in a rare display of unity .
the oecd observer mission said the vote had been free and fair .
referring to the “ abundance of romanian flags ” used by protesters , lavrov also cautioned the european union against trying to exploit the situation in moldova .
europe 's poorest country had been part of eu member romania until world war ii , when it was annexed by the soviet union .
moldovan president vladimir voronin accused romania on wednesday of being complicit in the mass demonstrations of up to 20,000 mainly youthful protesters .
voronin declared romania 's ambassador “ persona non grata ” and ordered him to leave moldova .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 08.04.2009 unrest in moldova brings complicated state into international focus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-communist protests have dragged moldova into the spotlight the current unrest in moldova over disputed election results has turned the international spotlight on the small former soviet state and its complicated relationship with europe and russia . for a lot of people , it is the first time that this complicated country has entered the modern consciousness .
but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .
the violence seemed to erupt from nowhere , but the protests that rocked moldova reflected tensions that have long been simmering in a poor corner of europe perched on the east-west fault line .
" the deeper causes go back to questions of identity and what moldova 's future is , " samuel greene , deputy director at the carnegie center in moscow , told deutsche welle .
" moldova is still suffering from the aftermath of a civil war and it does n't have full sovereignty over its territory .
in addition , in order to keep the peace voronin has struck a compromise with russia by which it promises basically not to move towards unification with romania , which was being discussed at some point ; it promises to really not look that seriously at european union membership and certainly not to look at nato membership . "
compromises hinder moldovan progress , say critics greene believes that many moldovans accuse the communist government 's compliance with russian demands of holding the country back and that has led , to a certain degree , to the violent protests .
" these compromises have closed off socio-economic prospects for a large part of the moldovan population that really did n't have a hand in making those compromises and did n't necessarily approve of those compromises , " he said .
" when the ruling group that had made those compromises and essentially closed that door for moldova announces that it is trying to stay in power indefinitely and at any cost and any means , it can lead to a certain amount of emotion and maybe even desperation .
what we 're seeing now is a sort of ' now or never ' situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 demonstrators stormed the palace and parliament with voronin 's communist party likely to remain in power despite doubts over the validity of the vote , there is concern that the protests could continue and even escalate .
however , greene believes that moldova has seen enough violence .
" i do n't think that we would see the return to violence and civil war , " he said .
" i think most people in moldova have been fairly shocked by the violence of these protests and have seemed not to have approved of that degree of violence .
i think that if there are further protests they are likely to a lot more peaceful . "
president 's balancing act causing frustration many experts think that the reasons for the sudden outbursts can be traced to the complicated relationship , cultivated by voronin , between moldova , the eu and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has made concessions to russia voronin , a soviet-era interior minister for moldova , has in recent years reinvented himself as " pro-eu " leader interested in forging strong ties with the west .
under his leadership , moldova has implemented the first three-year action plan within the framework of the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- which precedes accession talks .
and the eu , pushed in particular by its newest members from the former soviet bloc in eastern europe , has supported voronin , promising as recently as october to seal a " new and ambitious " relationship with moldova .
a year earlier , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia issued a joint statement pushing the eu to " acknowledge the pace of progress , moldova 's efforts and concrete achievements " under voronin 's leadership .
while turning to the west , voronin has also managed to keep relations with moscow - the supporter of the rebel transnistra region in eastern moldova - on a very warm track , also with support from the russian side .
moldova standing at east-west crossroads with voronin courting both brussels and moscow , and both sides reciprocating his overtures , each anxious not to cede dominant influence to the other , the stage was set for some kind of rupture within the country itself .
many moldovans believe that their country is going to have to make a choice : is it with europe or is it with russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has positioned moldova between the eu and russia " well , it 's a balancing act and to be honest , russia is incredibly important for moldova 's stability because it does control the fate of the breakaway republican interests in transnistra and it 's also important for moldova 's economy , " greene said .
" moldova 's economy depends tremendously on remittances from moldovans working abroad - a large number of those are in russia - and so that is obviously important to any moldovan government .
" but a large number of those workers are in europe and europe is a significantly more lucrative place for them to be than in russia , " he added .
" it is also impossible for any moldovan government to entirely close the door on europe .
but what voronin has tried to do is this balancing act which over time evolves basically into institutionalized indecisiveness that says ' we 're not going to move in any direction ' and that makes it very difficult for foreigners to invest in moldova and for people to develop the economy when you have no idea what the long term prospects for the country are . "
the eu will on may 7 launch the so-called " eastern partnership " program of closer ties with moldova along with ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan , armenia , and belarus .
the plan envisages aid , the gradual creation of a free trade zone and better energy ties .
the eu will also negotiate accords setting terms for cooperation in reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
will these initiatives sway the communists towards europe or lead to another power struggle to join the many that have gone before it in moldova 's history ?
how the new moldovan government and its russian overseers respond to these developments , only time will tell .

but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has positioned moldova between the eu and russia " well , it 's a balancing act and to be honest , russia is incredibly important for moldova 's stability because it does control the fate of the breakaway republican interests in transnistra and it 's also important for moldova 's economy , " greene said .
" moldova 's economy depends tremendously on remittances from moldovans working abroad - a large number of those are in russia - and so that is obviously important to any moldovan government .
" but a large number of those workers are in europe and europe is a significantly more lucrative place for them to be than in russia , " he added .
" it is also impossible for any moldovan government to entirely close the door on europe .
but what voronin has tried to do is this balancing act which over time evolves basically into institutionalized indecisiveness that says ' we 're not going to move in any direction ' and that makes it very difficult for foreigners to invest in moldova and for people to develop the economy when you have no idea what the long term prospects for the country are . "
the eu will on may 7 launch the so-called " eastern partnership " program of closer ties with moldova along with ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan , armenia , and belarus .
the plan envisages aid , the gradual creation of a free trade zone and better energy ties .
the eu will also negotiate accords setting terms for cooperation in reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
will these initiatives sway the communists towards europe or lead to another power struggle to join the many that have gone before it in moldova 's history ?
how the new moldovan government and its russian overseers respond to these developments , only time will tell .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all was harmony last year when klinsmann became the new bayern coach bayern munich president franz beckenbauer , or " the kaiser " as the germans like to call him , already caused a stir after the wolfsburg match by saying that bayern would have to reconsider klinsmann 's future at the club after this season .
however , he was immediately rebuffed by manager uli hoeneß .
" sometimes i 'm not sure whether franz is close enough to what 's actually happening to make a proper assessment , " hoeneß said .
klinsmann 's contract expires in 2010 , and bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has reportedly given klinsmann a job guarantee beyond the current contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's late cl final defeat in nou camp in 1999 traumatized players and fans alike nou camp – a bad omen for bayern ?
victory in barcelona would boost klinsmann 's prospects and silence critics , for the time being .
however , barca will be tough opponents and there is another aspect which may play a crucial psychological role .
bayern are likely to have bitter memories about their last trip to the nou camp which was the 1999 champions league final they famously lost 2-1 after leading 1-0 for most of the game against manchester united who scored two injury time goals through teddy sheringham and ole gunnar solskjaer . nk / pfd / rm dpa / rtr / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the subsidy has proven to be an especially successful instrument , " wilhelm said , referring to the 40 percent rise in car sales observed in march . " for this reason the coalition has agreed to an extension and an increase in funds . " the trade-in scheme is part of government stimulus package aimed at shoring up the economy in the face of a global downturn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is giving consumers 2,500 good reasons to scrap their old car and buy a new one it offers german car owners a government bonus of 2,500 euros for scrapping vehicles older than nine years and replacing them with new fuel-efficient models . more than a million german car owners have already applied for the subsidy , far exceeding government expectations of the scheme , which was originally intended to accommodate a maximum of 600,000 consumers . by more than tripling the funds earmarked for bonus payments , the scheme can now accommodate up to two million consumers . negative side effects ? while the government praises its car-scrapping premium as a great success , critics argue that the negative side-effects of the scheme are being overlooked .
these include falling sales at car parts retailers , auto repair shops and used-car dealers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the scheme does not benefit high-end german brands other detractors point out that small carmakers , especially from asia , have benefitted most from the incentive plan , while major german luxury brands , such as daimler and bmw , have reaped little reward . some members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union had opposed extending the bonus payments on cost grounds , warning that pumping more money into the scheme would only prolong germany 's worst economic downturn since world war ii . economic stimulus measures introduced by the german government are already expected to create 40-50 billion euros of new debt this year . but with some 40 million motorists driving to the polls for national elections in september , it seems few leading politicians in berlin are willing to oppose such a popular subsidy scheme . sje / pfd , dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opposition is claiming fraud . riot police in moldova have seized the president 's office and parliament after the two buildings were stormed and occupied by anti-government protesters on tuesday . the police took control of the buildings in the early hours of wednesday after two straight days of demonstrations at the election victory of the ruling communist party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police were unable to control the protestors by the time authorities moved in , most protesters had already left , having ransacked president vladimir voronin offices and looted the parliament , where fires raged into the night .
the afp news agency reported that around a dozen remaining demonstrators were arrested . opposition supporters have vowed to return in force on wednesday . an estimated 10,000 mainly young protestors gathered in the capital chisinau for the second consecutive day on tuesday to dispute the communist party 's victory in sunday 's election . demonstrators claim the elections were fraudulent .
media reports said many at the rally were carrying european union , moldovan and romanian flags , chanting " moldova has awoken , " " we want to join europe , " and " we want to join romania . "
police used water cannons against the protestors but were unable to stop them from storming the parliament building and a presidential office , breaking windows , setting fire to furniture and throwing computers out onto the street .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova is one of europe 's poorest countries the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on tuesday he was " very concerned " about the situation in chisinau .
he appealed to both the government and protestors to remain calm .
" i call on all sides to refrain from violence and provocation , " solana said in a statement released tuesday .
" violence against government buildings is unacceptable .
equally important is the respect for the inalienable right of assembly of peaceful demonstrators . "
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he was concerned over the protests that had been " provoked " in moldova , according to the interfax news agency .
opposition wants new elections international monitoring groups , including the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said the vote was generally democratic , with few violations of election law .
however , solana said preliminary findings by observers had noted that " further improvements were required to ensure an electoral process free from undue administrative interference and to increase public confidence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth of many protesters points to a generation gap opposition parties said they would continue their anti-communist protests until new elections had been called .
" the protests will continue until a date is set for new elections , " said chisinau mayor dorin chirtoaca , deputy head of the opposition liberal party which lost to the ruling communists in sunday 's election .
" we have asked international organizations to recognize the election results as invalid , " chirtoaca said .
" we support the protest action in the center of chisinau .
the protests are justified ; their participants are calling for justice to be restored . "
julian fruntasu , a spokesman for the opposition liberal democratic party of moldova , told the infotag news agency that the protests were justified " because the communists lost the elections . "
opposition parties said the vote was inherently unfair , as the election campaign was conducted with strong communist party control of major media and regional governments . nw / sac / msh / ncy , afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 08.04.2009 unrest in moldova brings complicated state into international focus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-communist protests have dragged moldova into the spotlight the current unrest in moldova over disputed election results has turned the international spotlight on the small former soviet state and its complicated relationship with europe and russia . for a lot of people , it is the first time that this complicated country has entered the modern consciousness .
but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .
the violence seemed to erupt from nowhere , but the protests that rocked moldova reflected tensions that have long been simmering in a poor corner of europe perched on the east-west fault line .
" the deeper causes go back to questions of identity and what moldova 's future is , " samuel greene , deputy director at the carnegie center in moscow , told deutsche welle .
" moldova is still suffering from the aftermath of a civil war and it does n't have full sovereignty over its territory .
in addition , in order to keep the peace voronin has struck a compromise with russia by which it promises basically not to move towards unification with romania , which was being discussed at some point ; it promises to really not look that seriously at european union membership and certainly not to look at nato membership . "
compromises hinder moldovan progress , say critics greene believes that many moldovans accuse the communist government 's compliance with russian demands of holding the country back and that has led , to a certain degree , to the violent protests .
" these compromises have closed off socio-economic prospects for a large part of the moldovan population that really did n't have a hand in making those compromises and did n't necessarily approve of those compromises , " he said .
" when the ruling group that had made those compromises and essentially closed that door for moldova announces that it is trying to stay in power indefinitely and at any cost and any means , it can lead to a certain amount of emotion and maybe even desperation .
what we 're seeing now is a sort of ' now or never ' situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 demonstrators stormed the palace and parliament with voronin 's communist party likely to remain in power despite doubts over the validity of the vote , there is concern that the protests could continue and even escalate .
however , greene believes that moldova has seen enough violence .
" i do n't think that we would see the return to violence and civil war , " he said .
" i think most people in moldova have been fairly shocked by the violence of these protests and have seemed not to have approved of that degree of violence .
i think that if there are further protests they are likely to a lot more peaceful . "
president 's balancing act causing frustration many experts think that the reasons for the sudden outbursts can be traced to the complicated relationship , cultivated by voronin , between moldova , the eu and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has made concessions to russia voronin , a soviet-era interior minister for moldova , has in recent years reinvented himself as " pro-eu " leader interested in forging strong ties with the west .
under his leadership , moldova has implemented the first three-year action plan within the framework of the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- which precedes accession talks .
and the eu , pushed in particular by its newest members from the former soviet bloc in eastern europe , has supported voronin , promising as recently as october to seal a " new and ambitious " relationship with moldova .
a year earlier , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia issued a joint statement pushing the eu to " acknowledge the pace of progress , moldova 's efforts and concrete achievements " under voronin 's leadership .
while turning to the west , voronin has also managed to keep relations with moscow - the supporter of the rebel transnistra region in eastern moldova - on a very warm track , also with support from the russian side .

many moldovans believe that their country is going to have to make a choice : is it with europe or is it with russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has positioned moldova between the eu and russia " well , it 's a balancing act and to be honest , russia is incredibly important for moldova 's stability because it does control the fate of the breakaway republican interests in transnistra and it 's also important for moldova 's economy , " greene said .
" moldova 's economy depends tremendously on remittances from moldovans working abroad - a large number of those are in russia - and so that is obviously important to any moldovan government .
" but a large number of those workers are in europe and europe is a significantly more lucrative place for them to be than in russia , " he added .
" it is also impossible for any moldovan government to entirely close the door on europe .
but what voronin has tried to do is this balancing act which over time evolves basically into institutionalized indecisiveness that says ' we 're not going to move in any direction ' and that makes it very difficult for foreigners to invest in moldova and for people to develop the economy when you have no idea what the long term prospects for the country are . "

but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .
the violence seemed to erupt from nowhere , but the protests that rocked moldova reflected tensions that have long been simmering in a poor corner of europe perched on the east-west fault line .
" the deeper causes go back to questions of identity and what moldova 's future is , " samuel greene , deputy director at the carnegie center in moscow , told deutsche welle .
" moldova is still suffering from the aftermath of a civil war and it does n't have full sovereignty over its territory .
in addition , in order to keep the peace voronin has struck a compromise with russia by which it promises basically not to move towards unification with romania , which was being discussed at some point ; it promises to really not look that seriously at european union membership and certainly not to look at nato membership . "
compromises hinder moldovan progress , say critics greene believes that many moldovans accuse the communist government 's compliance with russian demands of holding the country back and that has led , to a certain degree , to the violent protests .
" these compromises have closed off socio-economic prospects for a large part of the moldovan population that really did n't have a hand in making those compromises and did n't necessarily approve of those compromises , " he said .
" when the ruling group that had made those compromises and essentially closed that door for moldova announces that it is trying to stay in power indefinitely and at any cost and any means , it can lead to a certain amount of emotion and maybe even desperation .
what we 're seeing now is a sort of ' now or never ' situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 demonstrators stormed the palace and parliament with voronin 's communist party likely to remain in power despite doubts over the validity of the vote , there is concern that the protests could continue and even escalate .
however , greene believes that moldova has seen enough violence .
" i do n't think that we would see the return to violence and civil war , " he said .
" i think most people in moldova have been fairly shocked by the violence of these protests and have seemed not to have approved of that degree of violence .
i think that if there are further protests they are likely to a lot more peaceful . "
president 's balancing act causing frustration many experts think that the reasons for the sudden outbursts can be traced to the complicated relationship , cultivated by voronin , between moldova , the eu and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has made concessions to russia voronin , a soviet-era interior minister for moldova , has in recent years reinvented himself as " pro-eu " leader interested in forging strong ties with the west .
under his leadership , moldova has implemented the first three-year action plan within the framework of the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- which precedes accession talks .
and the eu , pushed in particular by its newest members from the former soviet bloc in eastern europe , has supported voronin , promising as recently as october to seal a " new and ambitious " relationship with moldova .
a year earlier , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia issued a joint statement pushing the eu to " acknowledge the pace of progress , moldova 's efforts and concrete achievements " under voronin 's leadership .
while turning to the west , voronin has also managed to keep relations with moscow - the supporter of the rebel transnistra region in eastern moldova - on a very warm track , also with support from the russian side .
moldova standing at east-west crossroads with voronin courting both brussels and moscow , and both sides reciprocating his overtures , each anxious not to cede dominant influence to the other , the stage was set for some kind of rupture within the country itself .
many moldovans believe that their country is going to have to make a choice : is it with europe or is it with russia ?

the opposition is claiming fraud . riot police in moldova have seized the president 's office and parliament after the two buildings were stormed and occupied by anti-government protesters on tuesday . the police took control of the buildings in the early hours of wednesday after two straight days of demonstrations at the election victory of the ruling communist party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police were unable to control the protestors by the time authorities moved in , most protesters had already left , having ransacked president vladimir voronin offices and looted the parliament , where fires raged into the night .
the afp news agency reported that around a dozen remaining demonstrators were arrested . opposition supporters have vowed to return in force on wednesday . an estimated 10,000 mainly young protestors gathered in the capital chisinau for the second consecutive day on tuesday to dispute the communist party 's victory in sunday 's election . demonstrators claim the elections were fraudulent .
media reports said many at the rally were carrying european union , moldovan and romanian flags , chanting " moldova has awoken , " " we want to join europe , " and " we want to join romania . "
police used water cannons against the protestors but were unable to stop them from storming the parliament building and a presidential office , breaking windows , setting fire to furniture and throwing computers out onto the street .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova is one of europe 's poorest countries the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on tuesday he was " very concerned " about the situation in chisinau .
he appealed to both the government and protestors to remain calm .

" violence against government buildings is unacceptable .
equally important is the respect for the inalienable right of assembly of peaceful demonstrators . "
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he was concerned over the protests that had been " provoked " in moldova , according to the interfax news agency .
opposition wants new elections international monitoring groups , including the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said the vote was generally democratic , with few violations of election law .
however , solana said preliminary findings by observers had noted that " further improvements were required to ensure an electoral process free from undue administrative interference and to increase public confidence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth of many protesters points to a generation gap opposition parties said they would continue their anti-communist protests until new elections had been called .

" we have asked international organizations to recognize the election results as invalid , " chirtoaca said .
" we support the protest action in the center of chisinau .
the protests are justified ; their participants are calling for justice to be restored . "
julian fruntasu , a spokesman for the opposition liberal democratic party of moldova , told the infotag news agency that the protests were justified " because the communists lost the elections . "

in developing countries with no unemployment insurance , they are now forced to work in positions with low pay and no protection , an oecd study says . some 1.8 billion people , or more than half of the global labor force , are working without formal contracts and social security , according to the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
this level is expected to increase to two-thirds of the workforce by 2020 and could go even higher if more jobs are lost to the economic crisis and more migrants return home to informal sector jobs , said the oecd report " is informal normal ? " which was released on wednesday .
in comparison , 1.2 billion people are officially employed worldwide .
" even during good times with robust growth rates , in many developing countries informal employment increased in some regions , " said johannes jutting , one of the study 's authors .
" though india grew during the last decade above five percentage points per year , people there feel better jobs are not being created . "
jutting said nine out of 10 employees in india , or some 370 million people , did not have formal social security .
this informal employment had severe consequences for poverty in developing countries , the study said .
low pay , with no social benefits , increased the likelihood that the millennium development goal of halving poverty worldwide by 2015 would not be met .
the oecd said " immediate and unconventional action " was urgently needed .
it said measures were necessary to improve infrastructure , help develop skills , promote institutional reform and increase access to resources for informal businesses both in the formal and informal employment sectors .
these steps should be accompanied by public works projects and better access to micro loans . sac / rm , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a compromise is needed soon if a global action plan against climate change is to be signed at the copenhagen summit in december . eleven days of un-led climate talks in the german city of bonn have ended without making any visible progress toward a global action against climate change .
the talks , which included some 2,700 representatives from 180 countries , were the latest in a series of un-led meetings meant to forge a deal in copenhagen in december to replace or extend the kyoto protocol .
some participants said the deadlock at the bonn meeting was reminiscent of the chicken and egg problem .
industrialized and developing countries were loath to make concrete commitments and appeared to be waiting for the other side to make the first move .
the main quarrel , which also emerged again at the bonn meeting , was about carbon emission targets and financing the battle against climate change .
row over emission targets and funds " i would n't say these talks have been successful .
one of the things countries were supposed to agree on was an overall target for developed countries but this was not achieved .
so i would say we 're coming out of the negotiations with not much more than we went in with , " said stephanie tunmore , a climate campaigner for greenpeace international . developing countries had hoped the meeting would set a range of emissions reduction targets for the group of industrialized nations as a whole .
developed countries , however , preffered to procrastinate until other talks on technical issues were concluded , for example on how far they could offset their emissions and count the effect of planting trees .
us policy shift signals hope however , not all was gloom and doom in bonn .
delegates did give their general backing to some specific technical proposals , such as the formation of a registry to measure and reward climate action in developing countries , and delegates were also heartened by the more constructive approach taken by the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the previous us administration under george w. bush refused to sign the kyoto protocol " it was really refreshing to get this attitude from a us delegation that spent the last eight years stalling and refusing to act .
so i think you could definitely say that within the negotiations there has been a subtle change in atmosphere that even if they 're not actually doing the work yet , the trust is starting to get rebuilt , " said tunmore .
the united states ' commitments are considered key to climate negotiations , however , president barack obama 's fledgling administration has not made any specific pledges yet .
the european union plans to reduce greenhouse gases by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .
more ambitious carbon reduction targets needed but the united nations ' climate chief yvo de boer indicated during wednesday 's press conference in bonn that even these targets might not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's head of climate change yvo de boer is calling on industrialized nations to further cut greenhouse gases " the intergovernmental panel on climate change has indicated that if we want to avoid severe impact of climate change we need to be working towards industrialised country emission reductions in the order of minus 25-40 by 2020 , " de boer said .
" the numbers that have been discussed so far are still a significant distance from that range , so more ambition is needed on behalf of industrialised countries if we are to get a robust response to climate change . "
looking ahead to the copenhagen summit , de boer called for more clarity and commitment if a successful global deal on climate change was to be reached .
" firstly we need clarity on the individual emission reduction targets to be adopted by industrialised countries , secondly we need clarity on what major developing countries will do to limit the growth of their emissions , " said de boer .
developing countries bear the brunt the un climate chief added the copenhagen summit had to deliver clarity on finance .
developing countries were to receive financial support to allow them to engage on mitigation to limit the growth of their emissions .
however , de boer emphasised that it was just as important that developing countries received financial support in order to adapt to the impact of climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries are bearing the brunt of climate change which often results in drought and flooding environment and development groups have been urging swifter action for years .
many warn that unabated climate change will cause human suffering far worse than the present financial crisis .
developing countries are likely to bear the brunt since many are situated in areas where desertification and flooding already constitute signficant problems .
the next un climate gathering is scheduled for june .
that meeting marks a deadline to start formal negotiations .
de boer has said that a negotiating text would be on the table by then , enabling a successful conclusion of climate talks at the copenhagen summit in december . nk / th , dpa / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a compromise is needed soon if a global action plan against climate change is to be signed at the copenhagen summit in december . eleven days of un-led climate talks in the german city of bonn have ended without making any visible progress toward a global action against climate change .
the talks , which included some 2,700 representatives from 180 countries , were the latest in a series of un-led meetings meant to forge a deal in copenhagen in december to replace or extend the kyoto protocol .
some participants said the deadlock at the bonn meeting was reminiscent of the chicken and egg problem .
industrialized and developing countries were loath to make concrete commitments and appeared to be waiting for the other side to make the first move .
the main quarrel , which also emerged again at the bonn meeting , was about carbon emission targets and financing the battle against climate change .
row over emission targets and funds " i would n't say these talks have been successful .
one of the things countries were supposed to agree on was an overall target for developed countries but this was not achieved .
so i would say we 're coming out of the negotiations with not much more than we went in with , " said stephanie tunmore , a climate campaigner for greenpeace international . developing countries had hoped the meeting would set a range of emissions reduction targets for the group of industrialized nations as a whole .
developed countries , however , preffered to procrastinate until other talks on technical issues were concluded , for example on how far they could offset their emissions and count the effect of planting trees .
us policy shift signals hope however , not all was gloom and doom in bonn .
delegates did give their general backing to some specific technical proposals , such as the formation of a registry to measure and reward climate action in developing countries , and delegates were also heartened by the more constructive approach taken by the united states .

but ngos say the measures are not sufficient to tackle the roots of poorer nations ' problems . the european union 's executive arm will pull forward aid to developing nations hard hit by the worldwide economic crisis .
" those least responsible for the financial crisis are among those worst hit by its economic effects , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
the european commission said it would bring forward 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in resources to 2009 previously earmarked to help poor countries fight a recession that has staunched credit flows , curtailed investment and sent a number of local currencies into a tailspin .
development commissioner louis michel said advancing money allowed the aid " to have an impact when it is most needed . "
the commission said it will speed up three billion euros , or 72 percent of its budget support to african , pacific and caribbean nations .
it will direct at least 500 million euros to support local welfare spending .
in addition , 800 million euros from an existing facility to combat hunger will be made available this year .
however , the eu will not provide additional funds .
" we did n't come here to announce to you any huge new sums , " michel said .
" of course our ambitions are limited .
but we are going to keep putting the pressure on . "
eu measures " an empty package " aid organizations , though , have criticized the eu plans .
the european ngo confederation for relief and development , concord , said the measures fell " far short " of what was needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change has hit developing nations particularly hard " less than one week after the g20 , the eu has produced a strategy that fails to address the underlying flaws in the system that we know fuel poverty in developing countries , " said concord 's eu policy officer ester asin-martinez .
the international anti-poverty agency actionaid said the plans left many issues open .
" we 're not clear on how europe is actually going to soften the blow of the financial crisis in poor countries , " alexandre polack , actionaid 's head of european policy , said in a statement .
polack said the package had little solutions to the problems faced by developing countries .
" we have not seen any useful ideas coming out of this package on how to support developing countries in dealing with climate change , on stopping tax evasion or on coping with the effects of trade policies , " polack said .
" the commission demonstrated its good intentions today , but what it is offering is effectively an empty package . "
by frontloading aid , the eu left open what would happen in subsequent years .
" we fear that with no new money , poor countries will suffer in years to come , when aid dries up , " said hetty kovach , oxfam international 's policy advisor on aid .
" europe needs to dig deep to help prevent this crisis from becoming a humanitarian disaster . "
aid must be a joint eu effort g20 leaders last week in london agreed on an international strategy to pull the global economy out of crisis , including new moves to help poor nations .
europe is the biggest aid donor in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel says europe can help in relieving human suffering " i am proud that europe is first to act after the g20 in support of developing countries , " michel said .
the commission said it would focus on three main measures : " first , keeping our promises , " second , paying more quickly old money earmarked last year for developing countries , and third , having the commission and member states work more closely together to be more efficient .
barroso said no country could hold back .
" the recession must not , can not and will not be used as an excuse for going back on our promises to keep on increasing aid , " barroso said .
aid from the 27 nation bloc rose to 49 billion euros last year .
but aid volumes will need to increase to some 69 billion euros in 2010 to meet interim aid spending targets , the commission said .
" we are now more than half way to the 2015 deadline for reaching the un millennium development goals and some of the gains achieved so far risk being forfeited , leaving poor countries worse off than before the crisis , " barroso said .
world leaders of 189 countries agreed on the so-called millennium development goals in 2000 .
they consist of eight targets for reducing poverty by 2015 - including halving the number of people living on less than $ 1 a day . sac / rm , reuters / afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" those least responsible for the financial crisis are among those worst hit by its economic effects , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
the european commission said it would bring forward 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in resources to 2009 previously earmarked to help poor countries fight a recession that has staunched credit flows , curtailed investment and sent a number of local currencies into a tailspin .
development commissioner louis michel said advancing money allowed the aid " to have an impact when it is most needed . "
the commission said it will speed up three billion euros , or 72 percent of its budget support to african , pacific and caribbean nations .
it will direct at least 500 million euros to support local welfare spending .
in addition , 800 million euros from an existing facility to combat hunger will be made available this year .
however , the eu will not provide additional funds .
" we did n't come here to announce to you any huge new sums , " michel said .
" of course our ambitions are limited .

polack said the package had little solutions to the problems faced by developing countries .
" we have not seen any useful ideas coming out of this package on how to support developing countries in dealing with climate change , on stopping tax evasion or on coping with the effects of trade policies , " polack said .
" the commission demonstrated its good intentions today , but what it is offering is effectively an empty package . "

in developing countries with no unemployment insurance , they are now forced to work in positions with low pay and no protection , an oecd study says . some 1.8 billion people , or more than half of the global labor force , are working without formal contracts and social security , according to the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
this level is expected to increase to two-thirds of the workforce by 2020 and could go even higher if more jobs are lost to the economic crisis and more migrants return home to informal sector jobs , said the oecd report " is informal normal ? " which was released on wednesday .
in comparison , 1.2 billion people are officially employed worldwide .
" even during good times with robust growth rates , in many developing countries informal employment increased in some regions , " said johannes jutting , one of the study 's authors .
" though india grew during the last decade above five percentage points per year , people there feel better jobs are not being created . "
jutting said nine out of 10 employees in india , or some 370 million people , did not have formal social security .
this informal employment had severe consequences for poverty in developing countries , the study said .
low pay , with no social benefits , increased the likelihood that the millennium development goal of halving poverty worldwide by 2015 would not be met .
the oecd said " immediate and unconventional action " was urgently needed .
it said measures were necessary to improve infrastructure , help develop skills , promote institutional reform and increase access to resources for informal businesses both in the formal and informal employment sectors .

but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .
the violence seemed to erupt from nowhere , but the protests that rocked moldova reflected tensions that have long been simmering in a poor corner of europe perched on the east-west fault line .
" the deeper causes go back to questions of identity and what moldova 's future is , " samuel greene , deputy director at the carnegie center in moscow , told deutsche welle .
" moldova is still suffering from the aftermath of a civil war and it does n't have full sovereignty over its territory .
in addition , in order to keep the peace voronin has struck a compromise with russia by which it promises basically not to move towards unification with romania , which was being discussed at some point ; it promises to really not look that seriously at european union membership and certainly not to look at nato membership . "
compromises hinder moldovan progress , say critics greene believes that many moldovans accuse the communist government 's compliance with russian demands of holding the country back and that has led , to a certain degree , to the violent protests .
" these compromises have closed off socio-economic prospects for a large part of the moldovan population that really did n't have a hand in making those compromises and did n't necessarily approve of those compromises , " he said .
" when the ruling group that had made those compromises and essentially closed that door for moldova announces that it is trying to stay in power indefinitely and at any cost and any means , it can lead to a certain amount of emotion and maybe even desperation .
what we 're seeing now is a sort of ' now or never ' situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 demonstrators stormed the palace and parliament with voronin 's communist party likely to remain in power despite doubts over the validity of the vote , there is concern that the protests could continue and even escalate .
however , greene believes that moldova has seen enough violence .
" i do n't think that we would see the return to violence and civil war , " he said .
" i think most people in moldova have been fairly shocked by the violence of these protests and have seemed not to have approved of that degree of violence .
i think that if there are further protests they are likely to a lot more peaceful . "
president 's balancing act causing frustration many experts think that the reasons for the sudden outbursts can be traced to the complicated relationship , cultivated by voronin , between moldova , the eu and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has made concessions to russia voronin , a soviet-era interior minister for moldova , has in recent years reinvented himself as " pro-eu " leader interested in forging strong ties with the west .
under his leadership , moldova has implemented the first three-year action plan within the framework of the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- which precedes accession talks .
and the eu , pushed in particular by its newest members from the former soviet bloc in eastern europe , has supported voronin , promising as recently as october to seal a " new and ambitious " relationship with moldova .
a year earlier , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia issued a joint statement pushing the eu to " acknowledge the pace of progress , moldova 's efforts and concrete achievements " under voronin 's leadership .
while turning to the west , voronin has also managed to keep relations with moscow - the supporter of the rebel transnistra region in eastern moldova - on a very warm track , also with support from the russian side .
moldova standing at east-west crossroads with voronin courting both brussels and moscow , and both sides reciprocating his overtures , each anxious not to cede dominant influence to the other , the stage was set for some kind of rupture within the country itself .
many moldovans believe that their country is going to have to make a choice : is it with europe or is it with russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has positioned moldova between the eu and russia " well , it 's a balancing act and to be honest , russia is incredibly important for moldova 's stability because it does control the fate of the breakaway republican interests in transnistra and it 's also important for moldova 's economy , " greene said .
" moldova 's economy depends tremendously on remittances from moldovans working abroad - a large number of those are in russia - and so that is obviously important to any moldovan government .
" but a large number of those workers are in europe and europe is a significantly more lucrative place for them to be than in russia , " he added .
" it is also impossible for any moldovan government to entirely close the door on europe .
but what voronin has tried to do is this balancing act which over time evolves basically into institutionalized indecisiveness that says ' we 're not going to move in any direction ' and that makes it very difficult for foreigners to invest in moldova and for people to develop the economy when you have no idea what the long term prospects for the country are . "
the eu will on may 7 launch the so-called " eastern partnership " program of closer ties with moldova along with ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan , armenia , and belarus .
the plan envisages aid , the gradual creation of a free trade zone and better energy ties .
the eu will also negotiate accords setting terms for cooperation in reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
will these initiatives sway the communists towards europe or lead to another power struggle to join the many that have gone before it in moldova 's history ?
how the new moldovan government and its russian overseers respond to these developments , only time will tell .

a compromise is needed soon if a global action plan against climate change is to be signed at the copenhagen summit in december . eleven days of un-led climate talks in the german city of bonn have ended without making any visible progress toward a global action against climate change .
the talks , which included some 2,700 representatives from 180 countries , were the latest in a series of un-led meetings meant to forge a deal in copenhagen in december to replace or extend the kyoto protocol .
some participants said the deadlock at the bonn meeting was reminiscent of the chicken and egg problem .
industrialized and developing countries were loath to make concrete commitments and appeared to be waiting for the other side to make the first move .
the main quarrel , which also emerged again at the bonn meeting , was about carbon emission targets and financing the battle against climate change .
row over emission targets and funds " i would n't say these talks have been successful .
one of the things countries were supposed to agree on was an overall target for developed countries but this was not achieved .
so i would say we 're coming out of the negotiations with not much more than we went in with , " said stephanie tunmore , a climate campaigner for greenpeace international . developing countries had hoped the meeting would set a range of emissions reduction targets for the group of industrialized nations as a whole .
developed countries , however , preffered to procrastinate until other talks on technical issues were concluded , for example on how far they could offset their emissions and count the effect of planting trees .
us policy shift signals hope however , not all was gloom and doom in bonn .
delegates did give their general backing to some specific technical proposals , such as the formation of a registry to measure and reward climate action in developing countries , and delegates were also heartened by the more constructive approach taken by the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the previous us administration under george w. bush refused to sign the kyoto protocol " it was really refreshing to get this attitude from a us delegation that spent the last eight years stalling and refusing to act .
so i think you could definitely say that within the negotiations there has been a subtle change in atmosphere that even if they 're not actually doing the work yet , the trust is starting to get rebuilt , " said tunmore .

" the numbers that have been discussed so far are still a significant distance from that range , so more ambition is needed on behalf of industrialised countries if we are to get a robust response to climate change . "
looking ahead to the copenhagen summit , de boer called for more clarity and commitment if a successful global deal on climate change was to be reached .
" firstly we need clarity on the individual emission reduction targets to be adopted by industrialised countries , secondly we need clarity on what major developing countries will do to limit the growth of their emissions , " said de boer .
developing countries bear the brunt the un climate chief added the copenhagen summit had to deliver clarity on finance .

a compromise is needed soon if a global action plan against climate change is to be signed at the copenhagen summit in december . eleven days of un-led climate talks in the german city of bonn have ended without making any visible progress toward a global action against climate change .
the talks , which included some 2,700 representatives from 180 countries , were the latest in a series of un-led meetings meant to forge a deal in copenhagen in december to replace or extend the kyoto protocol .
some participants said the deadlock at the bonn meeting was reminiscent of the chicken and egg problem .
industrialized and developing countries were loath to make concrete commitments and appeared to be waiting for the other side to make the first move .
the main quarrel , which also emerged again at the bonn meeting , was about carbon emission targets and financing the battle against climate change .
row over emission targets and funds " i would n't say these talks have been successful .
one of the things countries were supposed to agree on was an overall target for developed countries but this was not achieved .
so i would say we 're coming out of the negotiations with not much more than we went in with , " said stephanie tunmore , a climate campaigner for greenpeace international . developing countries had hoped the meeting would set a range of emissions reduction targets for the group of industrialized nations as a whole .
developed countries , however , preffered to procrastinate until other talks on technical issues were concluded , for example on how far they could offset their emissions and count the effect of planting trees .
us policy shift signals hope however , not all was gloom and doom in bonn .
delegates did give their general backing to some specific technical proposals , such as the formation of a registry to measure and reward climate action in developing countries , and delegates were also heartened by the more constructive approach taken by the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the previous us administration under george w. bush refused to sign the kyoto protocol " it was really refreshing to get this attitude from a us delegation that spent the last eight years stalling and refusing to act .
so i think you could definitely say that within the negotiations there has been a subtle change in atmosphere that even if they 're not actually doing the work yet , the trust is starting to get rebuilt , " said tunmore .

more ambitious carbon reduction targets needed but the united nations ' climate chief yvo de boer indicated during wednesday 's press conference in bonn that even these targets might not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's head of climate change yvo de boer is calling on industrialized nations to further cut greenhouse gases " the intergovernmental panel on climate change has indicated that if we want to avoid severe impact of climate change we need to be working towards industrialised country emission reductions in the order of minus 25-40 by 2020 , " de boer said .
" the numbers that have been discussed so far are still a significant distance from that range , so more ambition is needed on behalf of industrialised countries if we are to get a robust response to climate change . "
looking ahead to the copenhagen summit , de boer called for more clarity and commitment if a successful global deal on climate change was to be reached .
" firstly we need clarity on the individual emission reduction targets to be adopted by industrialised countries , secondly we need clarity on what major developing countries will do to limit the growth of their emissions , " said de boer .
developing countries bear the brunt the un climate chief added the copenhagen summit had to deliver clarity on finance .
developing countries were to receive financial support to allow them to engage on mitigation to limit the growth of their emissions .
however , de boer emphasised that it was just as important that developing countries received financial support in order to adapt to the impact of climate change .

but ngos say the measures are not sufficient to tackle the roots of poorer nations ' problems . the european union 's executive arm will pull forward aid to developing nations hard hit by the worldwide economic crisis .
" those least responsible for the financial crisis are among those worst hit by its economic effects , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
the european commission said it would bring forward 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in resources to 2009 previously earmarked to help poor countries fight a recession that has staunched credit flows , curtailed investment and sent a number of local currencies into a tailspin .
development commissioner louis michel said advancing money allowed the aid " to have an impact when it is most needed . "
the commission said it will speed up three billion euros , or 72 percent of its budget support to african , pacific and caribbean nations .
it will direct at least 500 million euros to support local welfare spending .
in addition , 800 million euros from an existing facility to combat hunger will be made available this year .
however , the eu will not provide additional funds .
" we did n't come here to announce to you any huge new sums , " michel said .
" of course our ambitions are limited .
but we are going to keep putting the pressure on . "
eu measures " an empty package " aid organizations , though , have criticized the eu plans .
the european ngo confederation for relief and development , concord , said the measures fell " far short " of what was needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change has hit developing nations particularly hard " less than one week after the g20 , the eu has produced a strategy that fails to address the underlying flaws in the system that we know fuel poverty in developing countries , " said concord 's eu policy officer ester asin-martinez .
the international anti-poverty agency actionaid said the plans left many issues open .
" we 're not clear on how europe is actually going to soften the blow of the financial crisis in poor countries , " alexandre polack , actionaid 's head of european policy , said in a statement .
polack said the package had little solutions to the problems faced by developing countries .
" we have not seen any useful ideas coming out of this package on how to support developing countries in dealing with climate change , on stopping tax evasion or on coping with the effects of trade policies , " polack said .
" the commission demonstrated its good intentions today , but what it is offering is effectively an empty package . "
by frontloading aid , the eu left open what would happen in subsequent years .
" we fear that with no new money , poor countries will suffer in years to come , when aid dries up , " said hetty kovach , oxfam international 's policy advisor on aid .
" europe needs to dig deep to help prevent this crisis from becoming a humanitarian disaster . "
aid must be a joint eu effort g20 leaders last week in london agreed on an international strategy to pull the global economy out of crisis , including new moves to help poor nations .
europe is the biggest aid donor in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel says europe can help in relieving human suffering " i am proud that europe is first to act after the g20 in support of developing countries , " michel said .
the commission said it would focus on three main measures : " first , keeping our promises , " second , paying more quickly old money earmarked last year for developing countries , and third , having the commission and member states work more closely together to be more efficient .
barroso said no country could hold back .
" the recession must not , can not and will not be used as an excuse for going back on our promises to keep on increasing aid , " barroso said .
aid from the 27 nation bloc rose to 49 billion euros last year .
but aid volumes will need to increase to some 69 billion euros in 2010 to meet interim aid spending targets , the commission said .
" we are now more than half way to the 2015 deadline for reaching the un millennium development goals and some of the gains achieved so far risk being forfeited , leaving poor countries worse off than before the crisis , " barroso said .

but ngos say the measures are not sufficient to tackle the roots of poorer nations ' problems . the european union 's executive arm will pull forward aid to developing nations hard hit by the worldwide economic crisis .
" those least responsible for the financial crisis are among those worst hit by its economic effects , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
the european commission said it would bring forward 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in resources to 2009 previously earmarked to help poor countries fight a recession that has staunched credit flows , curtailed investment and sent a number of local currencies into a tailspin .
development commissioner louis michel said advancing money allowed the aid " to have an impact when it is most needed . "
the commission said it will speed up three billion euros , or 72 percent of its budget support to african , pacific and caribbean nations .
it will direct at least 500 million euros to support local welfare spending .
in addition , 800 million euros from an existing facility to combat hunger will be made available this year .
however , the eu will not provide additional funds .
" we did n't come here to announce to you any huge new sums , " michel said .
" of course our ambitions are limited .
but we are going to keep putting the pressure on . "
eu measures " an empty package " aid organizations , though , have criticized the eu plans .
the european ngo confederation for relief and development , concord , said the measures fell " far short " of what was needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change has hit developing nations particularly hard " less than one week after the g20 , the eu has produced a strategy that fails to address the underlying flaws in the system that we know fuel poverty in developing countries , " said concord 's eu policy officer ester asin-martinez .
the international anti-poverty agency actionaid said the plans left many issues open .
" we 're not clear on how europe is actually going to soften the blow of the financial crisis in poor countries , " alexandre polack , actionaid 's head of european policy , said in a statement .
polack said the package had little solutions to the problems faced by developing countries .
" we have not seen any useful ideas coming out of this package on how to support developing countries in dealing with climate change , on stopping tax evasion or on coping with the effects of trade policies , " polack said .
" the commission demonstrated its good intentions today , but what it is offering is effectively an empty package . "
by frontloading aid , the eu left open what would happen in subsequent years .
" we fear that with no new money , poor countries will suffer in years to come , when aid dries up , " said hetty kovach , oxfam international 's policy advisor on aid .
" europe needs to dig deep to help prevent this crisis from becoming a humanitarian disaster . "
aid must be a joint eu effort g20 leaders last week in london agreed on an international strategy to pull the global economy out of crisis , including new moves to help poor nations .
europe is the biggest aid donor in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel says europe can help in relieving human suffering " i am proud that europe is first to act after the g20 in support of developing countries , " michel said .
the commission said it would focus on three main measures : " first , keeping our promises , " second , paying more quickly old money earmarked last year for developing countries , and third , having the commission and member states work more closely together to be more efficient .
barroso said no country could hold back .
" the recession must not , can not and will not be used as an excuse for going back on our promises to keep on increasing aid , " barroso said .
aid from the 27 nation bloc rose to 49 billion euros last year .
but aid volumes will need to increase to some 69 billion euros in 2010 to meet interim aid spending targets , the commission said .
" we are now more than half way to the 2015 deadline for reaching the un millennium development goals and some of the gains achieved so far risk being forfeited , leaving poor countries worse off than before the crisis , " barroso said .
world leaders of 189 countries agreed on the so-called millennium development goals in 2000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 08.04.2009 unrest in moldova brings complicated state into international focus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-communist protests have dragged moldova into the spotlight the current unrest in moldova over disputed election results has turned the international spotlight on the small former soviet state and its complicated relationship with europe and russia . for a lot of people , it is the first time that this complicated country has entered the modern consciousness .
but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .
the violence seemed to erupt from nowhere , but the protests that rocked moldova reflected tensions that have long been simmering in a poor corner of europe perched on the east-west fault line .
" the deeper causes go back to questions of identity and what moldova 's future is , " samuel greene , deputy director at the carnegie center in moscow , told deutsche welle .
" moldova is still suffering from the aftermath of a civil war and it does n't have full sovereignty over its territory .
in addition , in order to keep the peace voronin has struck a compromise with russia by which it promises basically not to move towards unification with romania , which was being discussed at some point ; it promises to really not look that seriously at european union membership and certainly not to look at nato membership . "
compromises hinder moldovan progress , say critics greene believes that many moldovans accuse the communist government 's compliance with russian demands of holding the country back and that has led , to a certain degree , to the violent protests .
" these compromises have closed off socio-economic prospects for a large part of the moldovan population that really did n't have a hand in making those compromises and did n't necessarily approve of those compromises , " he said .
" when the ruling group that had made those compromises and essentially closed that door for moldova announces that it is trying to stay in power indefinitely and at any cost and any means , it can lead to a certain amount of emotion and maybe even desperation .
what we 're seeing now is a sort of ' now or never ' situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 demonstrators stormed the palace and parliament with voronin 's communist party likely to remain in power despite doubts over the validity of the vote , there is concern that the protests could continue and even escalate .
however , greene believes that moldova has seen enough violence .
" i do n't think that we would see the return to violence and civil war , " he said .
" i think most people in moldova have been fairly shocked by the violence of these protests and have seemed not to have approved of that degree of violence .
i think that if there are further protests they are likely to a lot more peaceful . "
president 's balancing act causing frustration many experts think that the reasons for the sudden outbursts can be traced to the complicated relationship , cultivated by voronin , between moldova , the eu and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has made concessions to russia voronin , a soviet-era interior minister for moldova , has in recent years reinvented himself as " pro-eu " leader interested in forging strong ties with the west .
under his leadership , moldova has implemented the first three-year action plan within the framework of the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- which precedes accession talks .
and the eu , pushed in particular by its newest members from the former soviet bloc in eastern europe , has supported voronin , promising as recently as october to seal a " new and ambitious " relationship with moldova .
a year earlier , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia issued a joint statement pushing the eu to " acknowledge the pace of progress , moldova 's efforts and concrete achievements " under voronin 's leadership .
while turning to the west , voronin has also managed to keep relations with moscow - the supporter of the rebel transnistra region in eastern moldova - on a very warm track , also with support from the russian side .
moldova standing at east-west crossroads with voronin courting both brussels and moscow , and both sides reciprocating his overtures , each anxious not to cede dominant influence to the other , the stage was set for some kind of rupture within the country itself .
many moldovans believe that their country is going to have to make a choice : is it with europe or is it with russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has positioned moldova between the eu and russia " well , it 's a balancing act and to be honest , russia is incredibly important for moldova 's stability because it does control the fate of the breakaway republican interests in transnistra and it 's also important for moldova 's economy , " greene said .
" moldova 's economy depends tremendously on remittances from moldovans working abroad - a large number of those are in russia - and so that is obviously important to any moldovan government .
" but a large number of those workers are in europe and europe is a significantly more lucrative place for them to be than in russia , " he added .
" it is also impossible for any moldovan government to entirely close the door on europe .
but what voronin has tried to do is this balancing act which over time evolves basically into institutionalized indecisiveness that says ' we 're not going to move in any direction ' and that makes it very difficult for foreigners to invest in moldova and for people to develop the economy when you have no idea what the long term prospects for the country are . "
the eu will on may 7 launch the so-called " eastern partnership " program of closer ties with moldova along with ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan , armenia , and belarus .
the plan envisages aid , the gradual creation of a free trade zone and better energy ties .
the eu will also negotiate accords setting terms for cooperation in reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
will these initiatives sway the communists towards europe or lead to another power struggle to join the many that have gone before it in moldova 's history ?
how the new moldovan government and its russian overseers respond to these developments , only time will tell .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 08.04.2009 unrest in moldova brings complicated state into international focus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-communist protests have dragged moldova into the spotlight the current unrest in moldova over disputed election results has turned the international spotlight on the small former soviet state and its complicated relationship with europe and russia . for a lot of people , it is the first time that this complicated country has entered the modern consciousness .
but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .
the violence seemed to erupt from nowhere , but the protests that rocked moldova reflected tensions that have long been simmering in a poor corner of europe perched on the east-west fault line .
" the deeper causes go back to questions of identity and what moldova 's future is , " samuel greene , deputy director at the carnegie center in moscow , told deutsche welle .
" moldova is still suffering from the aftermath of a civil war and it does n't have full sovereignty over its territory .
in addition , in order to keep the peace voronin has struck a compromise with russia by which it promises basically not to move towards unification with romania , which was being discussed at some point ; it promises to really not look that seriously at european union membership and certainly not to look at nato membership . "
compromises hinder moldovan progress , say critics greene believes that many moldovans accuse the communist government 's compliance with russian demands of holding the country back and that has led , to a certain degree , to the violent protests .
" these compromises have closed off socio-economic prospects for a large part of the moldovan population that really did n't have a hand in making those compromises and did n't necessarily approve of those compromises , " he said .
" when the ruling group that had made those compromises and essentially closed that door for moldova announces that it is trying to stay in power indefinitely and at any cost and any means , it can lead to a certain amount of emotion and maybe even desperation .
what we 're seeing now is a sort of ' now or never ' situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 demonstrators stormed the palace and parliament with voronin 's communist party likely to remain in power despite doubts over the validity of the vote , there is concern that the protests could continue and even escalate .
however , greene believes that moldova has seen enough violence .
" i do n't think that we would see the return to violence and civil war , " he said .
" i think most people in moldova have been fairly shocked by the violence of these protests and have seemed not to have approved of that degree of violence .
i think that if there are further protests they are likely to a lot more peaceful . "
president 's balancing act causing frustration many experts think that the reasons for the sudden outbursts can be traced to the complicated relationship , cultivated by voronin , between moldova , the eu and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has made concessions to russia voronin , a soviet-era interior minister for moldova , has in recent years reinvented himself as " pro-eu " leader interested in forging strong ties with the west .
under his leadership , moldova has implemented the first three-year action plan within the framework of the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- which precedes accession talks .
and the eu , pushed in particular by its newest members from the former soviet bloc in eastern europe , has supported voronin , promising as recently as october to seal a " new and ambitious " relationship with moldova .
a year earlier , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia issued a joint statement pushing the eu to " acknowledge the pace of progress , moldova 's efforts and concrete achievements " under voronin 's leadership .
while turning to the west , voronin has also managed to keep relations with moscow - the supporter of the rebel transnistra region in eastern moldova - on a very warm track , also with support from the russian side .
moldova standing at east-west crossroads with voronin courting both brussels and moscow , and both sides reciprocating his overtures , each anxious not to cede dominant influence to the other , the stage was set for some kind of rupture within the country itself .
many moldovans believe that their country is going to have to make a choice : is it with europe or is it with russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has positioned moldova between the eu and russia " well , it 's a balancing act and to be honest , russia is incredibly important for moldova 's stability because it does control the fate of the breakaway republican interests in transnistra and it 's also important for moldova 's economy , " greene said .
" moldova 's economy depends tremendously on remittances from moldovans working abroad - a large number of those are in russia - and so that is obviously important to any moldovan government .
" but a large number of those workers are in europe and europe is a significantly more lucrative place for them to be than in russia , " he added .
" it is also impossible for any moldovan government to entirely close the door on europe .
but what voronin has tried to do is this balancing act which over time evolves basically into institutionalized indecisiveness that says ' we 're not going to move in any direction ' and that makes it very difficult for foreigners to invest in moldova and for people to develop the economy when you have no idea what the long term prospects for the country are . "
the eu will on may 7 launch the so-called " eastern partnership " program of closer ties with moldova along with ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan , armenia , and belarus .
the plan envisages aid , the gradual creation of a free trade zone and better energy ties .
the eu will also negotiate accords setting terms for cooperation in reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
will these initiatives sway the communists towards europe or lead to another power struggle to join the many that have gone before it in moldova 's history ?
how the new moldovan government and its russian overseers respond to these developments , only time will tell .

in developing countries with no unemployment insurance , they are now forced to work in positions with low pay and no protection , an oecd study says . some 1.8 billion people , or more than half of the global labor force , are working without formal contracts and social security , according to the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
this level is expected to increase to two-thirds of the workforce by 2020 and could go even higher if more jobs are lost to the economic crisis and more migrants return home to informal sector jobs , said the oecd report " is informal normal ? " which was released on wednesday .
in comparison , 1.2 billion people are officially employed worldwide .
" even during good times with robust growth rates , in many developing countries informal employment increased in some regions , " said johannes jutting , one of the study 's authors .
" though india grew during the last decade above five percentage points per year , people there feel better jobs are not being created . "
jutting said nine out of 10 employees in india , or some 370 million people , did not have formal social security .
this informal employment had severe consequences for poverty in developing countries , the study said .
low pay , with no social benefits , increased the likelihood that the millennium development goal of halving poverty worldwide by 2015 would not be met .
the oecd said " immediate and unconventional action " was urgently needed .
it said measures were necessary to improve infrastructure , help develop skills , promote institutional reform and increase access to resources for informal businesses both in the formal and informal employment sectors .
these steps should be accompanied by public works projects and better access to micro loans . sac / rm , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in developing countries with no unemployment insurance , they are now forced to work in positions with low pay and no protection , an oecd study says . some 1.8 billion people , or more than half of the global labor force , are working without formal contracts and social security , according to the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
this level is expected to increase to two-thirds of the workforce by 2020 and could go even higher if more jobs are lost to the economic crisis and more migrants return home to informal sector jobs , said the oecd report " is informal normal ? " which was released on wednesday .
in comparison , 1.2 billion people are officially employed worldwide .
" even during good times with robust growth rates , in many developing countries informal employment increased in some regions , " said johannes jutting , one of the study 's authors .
" though india grew during the last decade above five percentage points per year , people there feel better jobs are not being created . "
jutting said nine out of 10 employees in india , or some 370 million people , did not have formal social security .
this informal employment had severe consequences for poverty in developing countries , the study said .
low pay , with no social benefits , increased the likelihood that the millennium development goal of halving poverty worldwide by 2015 would not be met .
the oecd said " immediate and unconventional action " was urgently needed .
it said measures were necessary to improve infrastructure , help develop skills , promote institutional reform and increase access to resources for informal businesses both in the formal and informal employment sectors .

the opposition is claiming fraud . riot police in moldova have seized the president 's office and parliament after the two buildings were stormed and occupied by anti-government protesters on tuesday . the police took control of the buildings in the early hours of wednesday after two straight days of demonstrations at the election victory of the ruling communist party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police were unable to control the protestors by the time authorities moved in , most protesters had already left , having ransacked president vladimir voronin offices and looted the parliament , where fires raged into the night .
the afp news agency reported that around a dozen remaining demonstrators were arrested . opposition supporters have vowed to return in force on wednesday . an estimated 10,000 mainly young protestors gathered in the capital chisinau for the second consecutive day on tuesday to dispute the communist party 's victory in sunday 's election . demonstrators claim the elections were fraudulent .
media reports said many at the rally were carrying european union , moldovan and romanian flags , chanting " moldova has awoken , " " we want to join europe , " and " we want to join romania . "
police used water cannons against the protestors but were unable to stop them from storming the parliament building and a presidential office , breaking windows , setting fire to furniture and throwing computers out onto the street .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova is one of europe 's poorest countries the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on tuesday he was " very concerned " about the situation in chisinau .
he appealed to both the government and protestors to remain calm .
" i call on all sides to refrain from violence and provocation , " solana said in a statement released tuesday .
" violence against government buildings is unacceptable .
equally important is the respect for the inalienable right of assembly of peaceful demonstrators . "
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he was concerned over the protests that had been " provoked " in moldova , according to the interfax news agency .
opposition wants new elections international monitoring groups , including the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said the vote was generally democratic , with few violations of election law .
however , solana said preliminary findings by observers had noted that " further improvements were required to ensure an electoral process free from undue administrative interference and to increase public confidence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth of many protesters points to a generation gap opposition parties said they would continue their anti-communist protests until new elections had been called .
" the protests will continue until a date is set for new elections , " said chisinau mayor dorin chirtoaca , deputy head of the opposition liberal party which lost to the ruling communists in sunday 's election .
" we have asked international organizations to recognize the election results as invalid , " chirtoaca said .
" we support the protest action in the center of chisinau .
the protests are justified ; their participants are calling for justice to be restored . "
julian fruntasu , a spokesman for the opposition liberal democratic party of moldova , told the infotag news agency that the protests were justified " because the communists lost the elections . "
opposition parties said the vote was inherently unfair , as the election campaign was conducted with strong communist party control of major media and regional governments . nw / sac / msh / ncy , afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the oecd observer mission said the vote had been free and fair .
referring to the “ abundance of romanian flags ” used by protesters , lavrov also cautioned the european union against trying to exploit the situation in moldova .

but , management insists that the company is still economically viable . management for the convertible specialist filed papers for receivership on wednesday at an osnabrueck district court saying the company faced bankruptcy due to financial obligations related to an employee social plan worked out with the trade union .
representatives for the metalworkers ' union said karmann was planning to cut 1,340 jobs because of a lack of clients amid the global slump in demand for cars .
the loss of business , the company said , was making it impossible to finance planned layoffs as part of a company restructuring to cope with the global economic downturn .
the union said the essential reason for the financial shortfall was the shutdown of the car assembly unit .
karmann also used to do assembly work for renault , volkswagen and mercedes , which have all been hit by the crisis , and will now focus on building car parts , the company said .
karmann said the company was still economically viable and practically free of debt .
court receivership , a statement said , would allow the company to revamp its business model and save as many jobs as possible . gb / pfd , dpa / ap / rtrd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opposition is claiming fraud . riot police in moldova have seized the president 's office and parliament after the two buildings were stormed and occupied by anti-government protesters on tuesday . the police took control of the buildings in the early hours of wednesday after two straight days of demonstrations at the election victory of the ruling communist party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police were unable to control the protestors by the time authorities moved in , most protesters had already left , having ransacked president vladimir voronin offices and looted the parliament , where fires raged into the night .
the afp news agency reported that around a dozen remaining demonstrators were arrested . opposition supporters have vowed to return in force on wednesday . an estimated 10,000 mainly young protestors gathered in the capital chisinau for the second consecutive day on tuesday to dispute the communist party 's victory in sunday 's election . demonstrators claim the elections were fraudulent .
media reports said many at the rally were carrying european union , moldovan and romanian flags , chanting " moldova has awoken , " " we want to join europe , " and " we want to join romania . "
police used water cannons against the protestors but were unable to stop them from storming the parliament building and a presidential office , breaking windows , setting fire to furniture and throwing computers out onto the street .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova is one of europe 's poorest countries the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on tuesday he was " very concerned " about the situation in chisinau .
he appealed to both the government and protestors to remain calm .
" i call on all sides to refrain from violence and provocation , " solana said in a statement released tuesday .
" violence against government buildings is unacceptable .
equally important is the respect for the inalienable right of assembly of peaceful demonstrators . "
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he was concerned over the protests that had been " provoked " in moldova , according to the interfax news agency .
opposition wants new elections international monitoring groups , including the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said the vote was generally democratic , with few violations of election law .
however , solana said preliminary findings by observers had noted that " further improvements were required to ensure an electoral process free from undue administrative interference and to increase public confidence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth of many protesters points to a generation gap opposition parties said they would continue their anti-communist protests until new elections had been called .
" the protests will continue until a date is set for new elections , " said chisinau mayor dorin chirtoaca , deputy head of the opposition liberal party which lost to the ruling communists in sunday 's election .
" we have asked international organizations to recognize the election results as invalid , " chirtoaca said .
" we support the protest action in the center of chisinau .
the protests are justified ; their participants are calling for justice to be restored . "
julian fruntasu , a spokesman for the opposition liberal democratic party of moldova , told the infotag news agency that the protests were justified " because the communists lost the elections . "
opposition parties said the vote was inherently unfair , as the election campaign was conducted with strong communist party control of major media and regional governments . nw / sac / msh / ncy , afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opposition is claiming fraud . riot police in moldova have seized the president 's office and parliament after the two buildings were stormed and occupied by anti-government protesters on tuesday . the police took control of the buildings in the early hours of wednesday after two straight days of demonstrations at the election victory of the ruling communist party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police were unable to control the protestors by the time authorities moved in , most protesters had already left , having ransacked president vladimir voronin offices and looted the parliament , where fires raged into the night .
the afp news agency reported that around a dozen remaining demonstrators were arrested . opposition supporters have vowed to return in force on wednesday . an estimated 10,000 mainly young protestors gathered in the capital chisinau for the second consecutive day on tuesday to dispute the communist party 's victory in sunday 's election . demonstrators claim the elections were fraudulent .
media reports said many at the rally were carrying european union , moldovan and romanian flags , chanting " moldova has awoken , " " we want to join europe , " and " we want to join romania . "
police used water cannons against the protestors but were unable to stop them from storming the parliament building and a presidential office , breaking windows , setting fire to furniture and throwing computers out onto the street .

" the subsidy has proven to be an especially successful instrument , " wilhelm said , referring to the 40 percent rise in car sales observed in march . " for this reason the coalition has agreed to an extension and an increase in funds . " the trade-in scheme is part of government stimulus package aimed at shoring up the economy in the face of a global downturn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is giving consumers 2,500 good reasons to scrap their old car and buy a new one it offers german car owners a government bonus of 2,500 euros for scrapping vehicles older than nine years and replacing them with new fuel-efficient models . more than a million german car owners have already applied for the subsidy , far exceeding government expectations of the scheme , which was originally intended to accommodate a maximum of 600,000 consumers . by more than tripling the funds earmarked for bonus payments , the scheme can now accommodate up to two million consumers . negative side effects ? while the government praises its car-scrapping premium as a great success , critics argue that the negative side-effects of the scheme are being overlooked .
these include falling sales at car parts retailers , auto repair shops and used-car dealers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the scheme does not benefit high-end german brands other detractors point out that small carmakers , especially from asia , have benefitted most from the incentive plan , while major german luxury brands , such as daimler and bmw , have reaped little reward . some members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union had opposed extending the bonus payments on cost grounds , warning that pumping more money into the scheme would only prolong germany 's worst economic downturn since world war ii . economic stimulus measures introduced by the german government are already expected to create 40-50 billion euros of new debt this year . but with some 40 million motorists driving to the polls for national elections in september , it seems few leading politicians in berlin are willing to oppose such a popular subsidy scheme . sje / pfd , dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a compromise is needed soon if a global action plan against climate change is to be signed at the copenhagen summit in december . eleven days of un-led climate talks in the german city of bonn have ended without making any visible progress toward a global action against climate change .
the talks , which included some 2,700 representatives from 180 countries , were the latest in a series of un-led meetings meant to forge a deal in copenhagen in december to replace or extend the kyoto protocol .
some participants said the deadlock at the bonn meeting was reminiscent of the chicken and egg problem .
industrialized and developing countries were loath to make concrete commitments and appeared to be waiting for the other side to make the first move .
the main quarrel , which also emerged again at the bonn meeting , was about carbon emission targets and financing the battle against climate change .
row over emission targets and funds " i would n't say these talks have been successful .
one of the things countries were supposed to agree on was an overall target for developed countries but this was not achieved .
so i would say we 're coming out of the negotiations with not much more than we went in with , " said stephanie tunmore , a climate campaigner for greenpeace international . developing countries had hoped the meeting would set a range of emissions reduction targets for the group of industrialized nations as a whole .
developed countries , however , preffered to procrastinate until other talks on technical issues were concluded , for example on how far they could offset their emissions and count the effect of planting trees .
us policy shift signals hope however , not all was gloom and doom in bonn .
delegates did give their general backing to some specific technical proposals , such as the formation of a registry to measure and reward climate action in developing countries , and delegates were also heartened by the more constructive approach taken by the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the previous us administration under george w. bush refused to sign the kyoto protocol " it was really refreshing to get this attitude from a us delegation that spent the last eight years stalling and refusing to act .
so i think you could definitely say that within the negotiations there has been a subtle change in atmosphere that even if they 're not actually doing the work yet , the trust is starting to get rebuilt , " said tunmore .
the united states ' commitments are considered key to climate negotiations , however , president barack obama 's fledgling administration has not made any specific pledges yet .
the european union plans to reduce greenhouse gases by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .
more ambitious carbon reduction targets needed but the united nations ' climate chief yvo de boer indicated during wednesday 's press conference in bonn that even these targets might not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's head of climate change yvo de boer is calling on industrialized nations to further cut greenhouse gases " the intergovernmental panel on climate change has indicated that if we want to avoid severe impact of climate change we need to be working towards industrialised country emission reductions in the order of minus 25-40 by 2020 , " de boer said .
" the numbers that have been discussed so far are still a significant distance from that range , so more ambition is needed on behalf of industrialised countries if we are to get a robust response to climate change . "
looking ahead to the copenhagen summit , de boer called for more clarity and commitment if a successful global deal on climate change was to be reached .
" firstly we need clarity on the individual emission reduction targets to be adopted by industrialised countries , secondly we need clarity on what major developing countries will do to limit the growth of their emissions , " said de boer .
developing countries bear the brunt the un climate chief added the copenhagen summit had to deliver clarity on finance .
developing countries were to receive financial support to allow them to engage on mitigation to limit the growth of their emissions .
however , de boer emphasised that it was just as important that developing countries received financial support in order to adapt to the impact of climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries are bearing the brunt of climate change which often results in drought and flooding environment and development groups have been urging swifter action for years .
many warn that unabated climate change will cause human suffering far worse than the present financial crisis .
developing countries are likely to bear the brunt since many are situated in areas where desertification and flooding already constitute signficant problems .
the next un climate gathering is scheduled for june .
that meeting marks a deadline to start formal negotiations .
de boer has said that a negotiating text would be on the table by then , enabling a successful conclusion of climate talks at the copenhagen summit in december . nk / th , dpa / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but ngos say the measures are not sufficient to tackle the roots of poorer nations ' problems . the european union 's executive arm will pull forward aid to developing nations hard hit by the worldwide economic crisis .
" those least responsible for the financial crisis are among those worst hit by its economic effects , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
the european commission said it would bring forward 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in resources to 2009 previously earmarked to help poor countries fight a recession that has staunched credit flows , curtailed investment and sent a number of local currencies into a tailspin .
development commissioner louis michel said advancing money allowed the aid " to have an impact when it is most needed . "
the commission said it will speed up three billion euros , or 72 percent of its budget support to african , pacific and caribbean nations .
it will direct at least 500 million euros to support local welfare spending .
in addition , 800 million euros from an existing facility to combat hunger will be made available this year .
however , the eu will not provide additional funds .
" we did n't come here to announce to you any huge new sums , " michel said .
" of course our ambitions are limited .
but we are going to keep putting the pressure on . "
eu measures " an empty package " aid organizations , though , have criticized the eu plans .
the european ngo confederation for relief and development , concord , said the measures fell " far short " of what was needed .

the international anti-poverty agency actionaid said the plans left many issues open .
" we 're not clear on how europe is actually going to soften the blow of the financial crisis in poor countries , " alexandre polack , actionaid 's head of european policy , said in a statement .
polack said the package had little solutions to the problems faced by developing countries .
" we have not seen any useful ideas coming out of this package on how to support developing countries in dealing with climate change , on stopping tax evasion or on coping with the effects of trade policies , " polack said .
" the commission demonstrated its good intentions today , but what it is offering is effectively an empty package . "

" we fear that with no new money , poor countries will suffer in years to come , when aid dries up , " said hetty kovach , oxfam international 's policy advisor on aid .

europe is the biggest aid donor in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel says europe can help in relieving human suffering " i am proud that europe is first to act after the g20 in support of developing countries , " michel said .
the commission said it would focus on three main measures : " first , keeping our promises , " second , paying more quickly old money earmarked last year for developing countries , and third , having the commission and member states work more closely together to be more efficient .
barroso said no country could hold back .
" the recession must not , can not and will not be used as an excuse for going back on our promises to keep on increasing aid , " barroso said .
aid from the 27 nation bloc rose to 49 billion euros last year .
but aid volumes will need to increase to some 69 billion euros in 2010 to meet interim aid spending targets , the commission said .

the opposition is claiming fraud . riot police in moldova have seized the president 's office and parliament after the two buildings were stormed and occupied by anti-government protesters on tuesday . the police took control of the buildings in the early hours of wednesday after two straight days of demonstrations at the election victory of the ruling communist party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police were unable to control the protestors by the time authorities moved in , most protesters had already left , having ransacked president vladimir voronin offices and looted the parliament , where fires raged into the night .
the afp news agency reported that around a dozen remaining demonstrators were arrested . opposition supporters have vowed to return in force on wednesday . an estimated 10,000 mainly young protestors gathered in the capital chisinau for the second consecutive day on tuesday to dispute the communist party 's victory in sunday 's election . demonstrators claim the elections were fraudulent .
media reports said many at the rally were carrying european union , moldovan and romanian flags , chanting " moldova has awoken , " " we want to join europe , " and " we want to join romania . "
police used water cannons against the protestors but were unable to stop them from storming the parliament building and a presidential office , breaking windows , setting fire to furniture and throwing computers out onto the street .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova is one of europe 's poorest countries the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on tuesday he was " very concerned " about the situation in chisinau .
he appealed to both the government and protestors to remain calm .
" i call on all sides to refrain from violence and provocation , " solana said in a statement released tuesday .
" violence against government buildings is unacceptable .
equally important is the respect for the inalienable right of assembly of peaceful demonstrators . "
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he was concerned over the protests that had been " provoked " in moldova , according to the interfax news agency .
opposition wants new elections international monitoring groups , including the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said the vote was generally democratic , with few violations of election law .
however , solana said preliminary findings by observers had noted that " further improvements were required to ensure an electoral process free from undue administrative interference and to increase public confidence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth of many protesters points to a generation gap opposition parties said they would continue their anti-communist protests until new elections had been called .

" we have asked international organizations to recognize the election results as invalid , " chirtoaca said .
" we support the protest action in the center of chisinau .
the protests are justified ; their participants are calling for justice to be restored . "
julian fruntasu , a spokesman for the opposition liberal democratic party of moldova , told the infotag news agency that the protests were justified " because the communists lost the elections . "

the opposition is claiming fraud . riot police in moldova have seized the president 's office and parliament after the two buildings were stormed and occupied by anti-government protesters on tuesday . the police took control of the buildings in the early hours of wednesday after two straight days of demonstrations at the election victory of the ruling communist party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police were unable to control the protestors by the time authorities moved in , most protesters had already left , having ransacked president vladimir voronin offices and looted the parliament , where fires raged into the night .
the afp news agency reported that around a dozen remaining demonstrators were arrested . opposition supporters have vowed to return in force on wednesday . an estimated 10,000 mainly young protestors gathered in the capital chisinau for the second consecutive day on tuesday to dispute the communist party 's victory in sunday 's election . demonstrators claim the elections were fraudulent .
media reports said many at the rally were carrying european union , moldovan and romanian flags , chanting " moldova has awoken , " " we want to join europe , " and " we want to join romania . "
police used water cannons against the protestors but were unable to stop them from storming the parliament building and a presidential office , breaking windows , setting fire to furniture and throwing computers out onto the street .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova is one of europe 's poorest countries the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on tuesday he was " very concerned " about the situation in chisinau .
he appealed to both the government and protestors to remain calm .
" i call on all sides to refrain from violence and provocation , " solana said in a statement released tuesday .
" violence against government buildings is unacceptable .
equally important is the respect for the inalienable right of assembly of peaceful demonstrators . "
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he was concerned over the protests that had been " provoked " in moldova , according to the interfax news agency .
opposition wants new elections international monitoring groups , including the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said the vote was generally democratic , with few violations of election law .
however , solana said preliminary findings by observers had noted that " further improvements were required to ensure an electoral process free from undue administrative interference and to increase public confidence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth of many protesters points to a generation gap opposition parties said they would continue their anti-communist protests until new elections had been called .
" the protests will continue until a date is set for new elections , " said chisinau mayor dorin chirtoaca , deputy head of the opposition liberal party which lost to the ruling communists in sunday 's election .
" we have asked international organizations to recognize the election results as invalid , " chirtoaca said .
" we support the protest action in the center of chisinau .
the protests are justified ; their participants are calling for justice to be restored . "

the opposition is claiming fraud . riot police in moldova have seized the president 's office and parliament after the two buildings were stormed and occupied by anti-government protesters on tuesday . the police took control of the buildings in the early hours of wednesday after two straight days of demonstrations at the election victory of the ruling communist party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police were unable to control the protestors by the time authorities moved in , most protesters had already left , having ransacked president vladimir voronin offices and looted the parliament , where fires raged into the night .
the afp news agency reported that around a dozen remaining demonstrators were arrested . opposition supporters have vowed to return in force on wednesday . an estimated 10,000 mainly young protestors gathered in the capital chisinau for the second consecutive day on tuesday to dispute the communist party 's victory in sunday 's election . demonstrators claim the elections were fraudulent .
media reports said many at the rally were carrying european union , moldovan and romanian flags , chanting " moldova has awoken , " " we want to join europe , " and " we want to join romania . "
police used water cannons against the protestors but were unable to stop them from storming the parliament building and a presidential office , breaking windows , setting fire to furniture and throwing computers out onto the street .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova is one of europe 's poorest countries the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on tuesday he was " very concerned " about the situation in chisinau .
he appealed to both the government and protestors to remain calm .
" i call on all sides to refrain from violence and provocation , " solana said in a statement released tuesday .
" violence against government buildings is unacceptable .
equally important is the respect for the inalienable right of assembly of peaceful demonstrators . "
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he was concerned over the protests that had been " provoked " in moldova , according to the interfax news agency .
opposition wants new elections international monitoring groups , including the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said the vote was generally democratic , with few violations of election law .
however , solana said preliminary findings by observers had noted that " further improvements were required to ensure an electoral process free from undue administrative interference and to increase public confidence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth of many protesters points to a generation gap opposition parties said they would continue their anti-communist protests until new elections had been called .
" the protests will continue until a date is set for new elections , " said chisinau mayor dorin chirtoaca , deputy head of the opposition liberal party which lost to the ruling communists in sunday 's election .
" we have asked international organizations to recognize the election results as invalid , " chirtoaca said .
" we support the protest action in the center of chisinau .
the protests are justified ; their participants are calling for justice to be restored . "
julian fruntasu , a spokesman for the opposition liberal democratic party of moldova , told the infotag news agency that the protests were justified " because the communists lost the elections . "
opposition parties said the vote was inherently unfair , as the election campaign was conducted with strong communist party control of major media and regional governments . nw / sac / msh / ncy , afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 08.04.2009 bayern munich seek redemption against barcelona großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern coach jürgen klinsmann has called on players to perform or face the music bayern munich will try to silence critics when they take on barcelona in a crucial champions league quarter finals match on wednesday .
however , the venue may prove decisive . while spanish leaders barcelona have won five straight spanish league games going into the first champions league leg at the camp nou , bayern munich are still reeling from a humiliating weekend defeat in the bundesliga .
a brilliant wolfsburg thrashed bayern 5-1 on saturday , going to the top of the league in the process and leaving the bavarians in fourth place , three points off the top with eight matches left .
bayern 's management is now hoping for results in the lucrative champions league to silence the critics .
" mission impossible " " it feels like a mission impossible , but we know from experience that miracles or upsets do happen in football , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grafite 's back-heel goal against munich is likely to become legend bayern munich will be without injured central defender lucio , who picked up a muscle injury in the game against wolfsburg .
bayern are also without injured striker miroslav klose who is out for several weeks following surgery .
" we clearly expect that the team bends over backwards now , " rummenigge told the club website .
" it is now up to the team .
the team has to shoulder the responsibility now . "
the kaiser criticizes klinsmann the humiliating defeat at the hands of wolfsburg has cast doubts on jürgen klinsmann 's future as bayern coach .
the clouds on the horizon are likely to darken further if the bavarians fail to reach the semis of the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all was harmony last year when klinsmann became the new bayern coach bayern munich president franz beckenbauer , or " the kaiser " as the germans like to call him , already caused a stir after the wolfsburg match by saying that bayern would have to reconsider klinsmann 's future at the club after this season .
however , he was immediately rebuffed by manager uli hoeneß .
" sometimes i 'm not sure whether franz is close enough to what 's actually happening to make a proper assessment , " hoeneß said .
klinsmann 's contract expires in 2010 , and bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has reportedly given klinsmann a job guarantee beyond the current contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's late cl final defeat in nou camp in 1999 traumatized players and fans alike nou camp – a bad omen for bayern ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 08.04.2009 unrest in moldova brings complicated state into international focus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-communist protests have dragged moldova into the spotlight the current unrest in moldova over disputed election results has turned the international spotlight on the small former soviet state and its complicated relationship with europe and russia . for a lot of people , it is the first time that this complicated country has entered the modern consciousness .
but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .
the violence seemed to erupt from nowhere , but the protests that rocked moldova reflected tensions that have long been simmering in a poor corner of europe perched on the east-west fault line .
" the deeper causes go back to questions of identity and what moldova 's future is , " samuel greene , deputy director at the carnegie center in moscow , told deutsche welle .
" moldova is still suffering from the aftermath of a civil war and it does n't have full sovereignty over its territory .
in addition , in order to keep the peace voronin has struck a compromise with russia by which it promises basically not to move towards unification with romania , which was being discussed at some point ; it promises to really not look that seriously at european union membership and certainly not to look at nato membership . "
compromises hinder moldovan progress , say critics greene believes that many moldovans accuse the communist government 's compliance with russian demands of holding the country back and that has led , to a certain degree , to the violent protests .
" these compromises have closed off socio-economic prospects for a large part of the moldovan population that really did n't have a hand in making those compromises and did n't necessarily approve of those compromises , " he said .
" when the ruling group that had made those compromises and essentially closed that door for moldova announces that it is trying to stay in power indefinitely and at any cost and any means , it can lead to a certain amount of emotion and maybe even desperation .
what we 're seeing now is a sort of ' now or never ' situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 demonstrators stormed the palace and parliament with voronin 's communist party likely to remain in power despite doubts over the validity of the vote , there is concern that the protests could continue and even escalate .
however , greene believes that moldova has seen enough violence .
" i do n't think that we would see the return to violence and civil war , " he said .
" i think most people in moldova have been fairly shocked by the violence of these protests and have seemed not to have approved of that degree of violence .
i think that if there are further protests they are likely to a lot more peaceful . "
president 's balancing act causing frustration many experts think that the reasons for the sudden outbursts can be traced to the complicated relationship , cultivated by voronin , between moldova , the eu and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has made concessions to russia voronin , a soviet-era interior minister for moldova , has in recent years reinvented himself as " pro-eu " leader interested in forging strong ties with the west .
under his leadership , moldova has implemented the first three-year action plan within the framework of the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- which precedes accession talks .
and the eu , pushed in particular by its newest members from the former soviet bloc in eastern europe , has supported voronin , promising as recently as october to seal a " new and ambitious " relationship with moldova .
a year earlier , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia issued a joint statement pushing the eu to " acknowledge the pace of progress , moldova 's efforts and concrete achievements " under voronin 's leadership .
while turning to the west , voronin has also managed to keep relations with moscow - the supporter of the rebel transnistra region in eastern moldova - on a very warm track , also with support from the russian side .
moldova standing at east-west crossroads with voronin courting both brussels and moscow , and both sides reciprocating his overtures , each anxious not to cede dominant influence to the other , the stage was set for some kind of rupture within the country itself .
many moldovans believe that their country is going to have to make a choice : is it with europe or is it with russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has positioned moldova between the eu and russia " well , it 's a balancing act and to be honest , russia is incredibly important for moldova 's stability because it does control the fate of the breakaway republican interests in transnistra and it 's also important for moldova 's economy , " greene said .
" moldova 's economy depends tremendously on remittances from moldovans working abroad - a large number of those are in russia - and so that is obviously important to any moldovan government .
" but a large number of those workers are in europe and europe is a significantly more lucrative place for them to be than in russia , " he added .
" it is also impossible for any moldovan government to entirely close the door on europe .
but what voronin has tried to do is this balancing act which over time evolves basically into institutionalized indecisiveness that says ' we 're not going to move in any direction ' and that makes it very difficult for foreigners to invest in moldova and for people to develop the economy when you have no idea what the long term prospects for the country are . "
the eu will on may 7 launch the so-called " eastern partnership " program of closer ties with moldova along with ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan , armenia , and belarus .
the plan envisages aid , the gradual creation of a free trade zone and better energy ties .
the eu will also negotiate accords setting terms for cooperation in reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
will these initiatives sway the communists towards europe or lead to another power struggle to join the many that have gone before it in moldova 's history ?
how the new moldovan government and its russian overseers respond to these developments , only time will tell .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 08.04.2009 unrest in moldova brings complicated state into international focus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-communist protests have dragged moldova into the spotlight the current unrest in moldova over disputed election results has turned the international spotlight on the small former soviet state and its complicated relationship with europe and russia . for a lot of people , it is the first time that this complicated country has entered the modern consciousness .
but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .
the violence seemed to erupt from nowhere , but the protests that rocked moldova reflected tensions that have long been simmering in a poor corner of europe perched on the east-west fault line .
" the deeper causes go back to questions of identity and what moldova 's future is , " samuel greene , deputy director at the carnegie center in moscow , told deutsche welle .
" moldova is still suffering from the aftermath of a civil war and it does n't have full sovereignty over its territory .
in addition , in order to keep the peace voronin has struck a compromise with russia by which it promises basically not to move towards unification with romania , which was being discussed at some point ; it promises to really not look that seriously at european union membership and certainly not to look at nato membership . "
compromises hinder moldovan progress , say critics greene believes that many moldovans accuse the communist government 's compliance with russian demands of holding the country back and that has led , to a certain degree , to the violent protests .
" these compromises have closed off socio-economic prospects for a large part of the moldovan population that really did n't have a hand in making those compromises and did n't necessarily approve of those compromises , " he said .
" when the ruling group that had made those compromises and essentially closed that door for moldova announces that it is trying to stay in power indefinitely and at any cost and any means , it can lead to a certain amount of emotion and maybe even desperation .
what we 're seeing now is a sort of ' now or never ' situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 demonstrators stormed the palace and parliament with voronin 's communist party likely to remain in power despite doubts over the validity of the vote , there is concern that the protests could continue and even escalate .
however , greene believes that moldova has seen enough violence .
" i do n't think that we would see the return to violence and civil war , " he said .
" i think most people in moldova have been fairly shocked by the violence of these protests and have seemed not to have approved of that degree of violence .
i think that if there are further protests they are likely to a lot more peaceful . "
president 's balancing act causing frustration many experts think that the reasons for the sudden outbursts can be traced to the complicated relationship , cultivated by voronin , between moldova , the eu and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has made concessions to russia voronin , a soviet-era interior minister for moldova , has in recent years reinvented himself as " pro-eu " leader interested in forging strong ties with the west .
under his leadership , moldova has implemented the first three-year action plan within the framework of the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- which precedes accession talks .
and the eu , pushed in particular by its newest members from the former soviet bloc in eastern europe , has supported voronin , promising as recently as october to seal a " new and ambitious " relationship with moldova .
a year earlier , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia issued a joint statement pushing the eu to " acknowledge the pace of progress , moldova 's efforts and concrete achievements " under voronin 's leadership .
while turning to the west , voronin has also managed to keep relations with moscow - the supporter of the rebel transnistra region in eastern moldova - on a very warm track , also with support from the russian side .
moldova standing at east-west crossroads with voronin courting both brussels and moscow , and both sides reciprocating his overtures , each anxious not to cede dominant influence to the other , the stage was set for some kind of rupture within the country itself .
many moldovans believe that their country is going to have to make a choice : is it with europe or is it with russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has positioned moldova between the eu and russia " well , it 's a balancing act and to be honest , russia is incredibly important for moldova 's stability because it does control the fate of the breakaway republican interests in transnistra and it 's also important for moldova 's economy , " greene said .
" moldova 's economy depends tremendously on remittances from moldovans working abroad - a large number of those are in russia - and so that is obviously important to any moldovan government .
" but a large number of those workers are in europe and europe is a significantly more lucrative place for them to be than in russia , " he added .
" it is also impossible for any moldovan government to entirely close the door on europe .
but what voronin has tried to do is this balancing act which over time evolves basically into institutionalized indecisiveness that says ' we 're not going to move in any direction ' and that makes it very difficult for foreigners to invest in moldova and for people to develop the economy when you have no idea what the long term prospects for the country are . "
the eu will on may 7 launch the so-called " eastern partnership " program of closer ties with moldova along with ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan , armenia , and belarus .
the plan envisages aid , the gradual creation of a free trade zone and better energy ties .
the eu will also negotiate accords setting terms for cooperation in reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
will these initiatives sway the communists towards europe or lead to another power struggle to join the many that have gone before it in moldova 's history ?
how the new moldovan government and its russian overseers respond to these developments , only time will tell .

" these compromises have closed off socio-economic prospects for a large part of the moldovan population that really did n't have a hand in making those compromises and did n't necessarily approve of those compromises , " he said .
" when the ruling group that had made those compromises and essentially closed that door for moldova announces that it is trying to stay in power indefinitely and at any cost and any means , it can lead to a certain amount of emotion and maybe even desperation .
what we 're seeing now is a sort of ' now or never ' situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 demonstrators stormed the palace and parliament with voronin 's communist party likely to remain in power despite doubts over the validity of the vote , there is concern that the protests could continue and even escalate .
however , greene believes that moldova has seen enough violence .
" i do n't think that we would see the return to violence and civil war , " he said .
" i think most people in moldova have been fairly shocked by the violence of these protests and have seemed not to have approved of that degree of violence .
i think that if there are further protests they are likely to a lot more peaceful . "
president 's balancing act causing frustration many experts think that the reasons for the sudden outbursts can be traced to the complicated relationship , cultivated by voronin , between moldova , the eu and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has made concessions to russia voronin , a soviet-era interior minister for moldova , has in recent years reinvented himself as " pro-eu " leader interested in forging strong ties with the west .
under his leadership , moldova has implemented the first three-year action plan within the framework of the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- which precedes accession talks .
and the eu , pushed in particular by its newest members from the former soviet bloc in eastern europe , has supported voronin , promising as recently as october to seal a " new and ambitious " relationship with moldova .
a year earlier , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia issued a joint statement pushing the eu to " acknowledge the pace of progress , moldova 's efforts and concrete achievements " under voronin 's leadership .
while turning to the west , voronin has also managed to keep relations with moscow - the supporter of the rebel transnistra region in eastern moldova - on a very warm track , also with support from the russian side .
moldova standing at east-west crossroads with voronin courting both brussels and moscow , and both sides reciprocating his overtures , each anxious not to cede dominant influence to the other , the stage was set for some kind of rupture within the country itself .
many moldovans believe that their country is going to have to make a choice : is it with europe or is it with russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has positioned moldova between the eu and russia " well , it 's a balancing act and to be honest , russia is incredibly important for moldova 's stability because it does control the fate of the breakaway republican interests in transnistra and it 's also important for moldova 's economy , " greene said .
" moldova 's economy depends tremendously on remittances from moldovans working abroad - a large number of those are in russia - and so that is obviously important to any moldovan government .
" but a large number of those workers are in europe and europe is a significantly more lucrative place for them to be than in russia , " he added .
" it is also impossible for any moldovan government to entirely close the door on europe .
but what voronin has tried to do is this balancing act which over time evolves basically into institutionalized indecisiveness that says ' we 're not going to move in any direction ' and that makes it very difficult for foreigners to invest in moldova and for people to develop the economy when you have no idea what the long term prospects for the country are . "
the eu will on may 7 launch the so-called " eastern partnership " program of closer ties with moldova along with ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan , armenia , and belarus .
the plan envisages aid , the gradual creation of a free trade zone and better energy ties .
the eu will also negotiate accords setting terms for cooperation in reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
will these initiatives sway the communists towards europe or lead to another power struggle to join the many that have gone before it in moldova 's history ?
how the new moldovan government and its russian overseers respond to these developments , only time will tell .

the opposition is claiming fraud . riot police in moldova have seized the president 's office and parliament after the two buildings were stormed and occupied by anti-government protesters on tuesday . the police took control of the buildings in the early hours of wednesday after two straight days of demonstrations at the election victory of the ruling communist party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police were unable to control the protestors by the time authorities moved in , most protesters had already left , having ransacked president vladimir voronin offices and looted the parliament , where fires raged into the night .
the afp news agency reported that around a dozen remaining demonstrators were arrested . opposition supporters have vowed to return in force on wednesday . an estimated 10,000 mainly young protestors gathered in the capital chisinau for the second consecutive day on tuesday to dispute the communist party 's victory in sunday 's election . demonstrators claim the elections were fraudulent .
media reports said many at the rally were carrying european union , moldovan and romanian flags , chanting " moldova has awoken , " " we want to join europe , " and " we want to join romania . "
police used water cannons against the protestors but were unable to stop them from storming the parliament building and a presidential office , breaking windows , setting fire to furniture and throwing computers out onto the street .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova is one of europe 's poorest countries the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on tuesday he was " very concerned " about the situation in chisinau .
he appealed to both the government and protestors to remain calm .

" violence against government buildings is unacceptable .
equally important is the respect for the inalienable right of assembly of peaceful demonstrators . "
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he was concerned over the protests that had been " provoked " in moldova , according to the interfax news agency .
opposition wants new elections international monitoring groups , including the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said the vote was generally democratic , with few violations of election law .
however , solana said preliminary findings by observers had noted that " further improvements were required to ensure an electoral process free from undue administrative interference and to increase public confidence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth of many protesters points to a generation gap opposition parties said they would continue their anti-communist protests until new elections had been called .

" we have asked international organizations to recognize the election results as invalid , " chirtoaca said .
" we support the protest action in the center of chisinau .
the protests are justified ; their participants are calling for justice to be restored . "
julian fruntasu , a spokesman for the opposition liberal democratic party of moldova , told the infotag news agency that the protests were justified " because the communists lost the elections . "

in developing countries with no unemployment insurance , they are now forced to work in positions with low pay and no protection , an oecd study says . some 1.8 billion people , or more than half of the global labor force , are working without formal contracts and social security , according to the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
this level is expected to increase to two-thirds of the workforce by 2020 and could go even higher if more jobs are lost to the economic crisis and more migrants return home to informal sector jobs , said the oecd report " is informal normal ? " which was released on wednesday .
in comparison , 1.2 billion people are officially employed worldwide .
" even during good times with robust growth rates , in many developing countries informal employment increased in some regions , " said johannes jutting , one of the study 's authors .
" though india grew during the last decade above five percentage points per year , people there feel better jobs are not being created . "
jutting said nine out of 10 employees in india , or some 370 million people , did not have formal social security .
this informal employment had severe consequences for poverty in developing countries , the study said .
low pay , with no social benefits , increased the likelihood that the millennium development goal of halving poverty worldwide by 2015 would not be met .
the oecd said " immediate and unconventional action " was urgently needed .
it said measures were necessary to improve infrastructure , help develop skills , promote institutional reform and increase access to resources for informal businesses both in the formal and informal employment sectors .
these steps should be accompanied by public works projects and better access to micro loans . sac / rm , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 08.04.2009 rifts remain over global climate deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reducing carbon emissions is a key issue in ongoing un-led climate negotiations un-led climate talks in bonn have ended with little visible progress .
a compromise is needed soon if a global action plan against climate change is to be signed at the copenhagen summit in december . eleven days of un-led climate talks in the german city of bonn have ended without making any visible progress toward a global action against climate change .
the talks , which included some 2,700 representatives from 180 countries , were the latest in a series of un-led meetings meant to forge a deal in copenhagen in december to replace or extend the kyoto protocol .
some participants said the deadlock at the bonn meeting was reminiscent of the chicken and egg problem .
industrialized and developing countries were loath to make concrete commitments and appeared to be waiting for the other side to make the first move .
the main quarrel , which also emerged again at the bonn meeting , was about carbon emission targets and financing the battle against climate change .
row over emission targets and funds " i would n't say these talks have been successful .
one of the things countries were supposed to agree on was an overall target for developed countries but this was not achieved .
so i would say we 're coming out of the negotiations with not much more than we went in with , " said stephanie tunmore , a climate campaigner for greenpeace international . developing countries had hoped the meeting would set a range of emissions reduction targets for the group of industrialized nations as a whole .
developed countries , however , preffered to procrastinate until other talks on technical issues were concluded , for example on how far they could offset their emissions and count the effect of planting trees .
us policy shift signals hope however , not all was gloom and doom in bonn .
delegates did give their general backing to some specific technical proposals , such as the formation of a registry to measure and reward climate action in developing countries , and delegates were also heartened by the more constructive approach taken by the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the previous us administration under george w. bush refused to sign the kyoto protocol " it was really refreshing to get this attitude from a us delegation that spent the last eight years stalling and refusing to act .
so i think you could definitely say that within the negotiations there has been a subtle change in atmosphere that even if they 're not actually doing the work yet , the trust is starting to get rebuilt , " said tunmore .
the united states ' commitments are considered key to climate negotiations , however , president barack obama 's fledgling administration has not made any specific pledges yet .
the european union plans to reduce greenhouse gases by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .
more ambitious carbon reduction targets needed but the united nations ' climate chief yvo de boer indicated during wednesday 's press conference in bonn that even these targets might not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's head of climate change yvo de boer is calling on industrialized nations to further cut greenhouse gases " the intergovernmental panel on climate change has indicated that if we want to avoid severe impact of climate change we need to be working towards industrialised country emission reductions in the order of minus 25-40 by 2020 , " de boer said .
" the numbers that have been discussed so far are still a significant distance from that range , so more ambition is needed on behalf of industrialised countries if we are to get a robust response to climate change . "
looking ahead to the copenhagen summit , de boer called for more clarity and commitment if a successful global deal on climate change was to be reached .
" firstly we need clarity on the individual emission reduction targets to be adopted by industrialised countries , secondly we need clarity on what major developing countries will do to limit the growth of their emissions , " said de boer .
developing countries bear the brunt the un climate chief added the copenhagen summit had to deliver clarity on finance .
developing countries were to receive financial support to allow them to engage on mitigation to limit the growth of their emissions .
however , de boer emphasised that it was just as important that developing countries received financial support in order to adapt to the impact of climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries are bearing the brunt of climate change which often results in drought and flooding environment and development groups have been urging swifter action for years .
many warn that unabated climate change will cause human suffering far worse than the present financial crisis .
developing countries are likely to bear the brunt since many are situated in areas where desertification and flooding already constitute signficant problems .
the next un climate gathering is scheduled for june .
that meeting marks a deadline to start formal negotiations .
de boer has said that a negotiating text would be on the table by then , enabling a successful conclusion of climate talks at the copenhagen summit in december . nk / th , dpa / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a compromise is needed soon if a global action plan against climate change is to be signed at the copenhagen summit in december . eleven days of un-led climate talks in the german city of bonn have ended without making any visible progress toward a global action against climate change .
the talks , which included some 2,700 representatives from 180 countries , were the latest in a series of un-led meetings meant to forge a deal in copenhagen in december to replace or extend the kyoto protocol .
some participants said the deadlock at the bonn meeting was reminiscent of the chicken and egg problem .
industrialized and developing countries were loath to make concrete commitments and appeared to be waiting for the other side to make the first move .
the main quarrel , which also emerged again at the bonn meeting , was about carbon emission targets and financing the battle against climate change .
row over emission targets and funds " i would n't say these talks have been successful .
one of the things countries were supposed to agree on was an overall target for developed countries but this was not achieved .
so i would say we 're coming out of the negotiations with not much more than we went in with , " said stephanie tunmore , a climate campaigner for greenpeace international . developing countries had hoped the meeting would set a range of emissions reduction targets for the group of industrialized nations as a whole .
developed countries , however , preffered to procrastinate until other talks on technical issues were concluded , for example on how far they could offset their emissions and count the effect of planting trees .
us policy shift signals hope however , not all was gloom and doom in bonn .
delegates did give their general backing to some specific technical proposals , such as the formation of a registry to measure and reward climate action in developing countries , and delegates were also heartened by the more constructive approach taken by the united states .

" the numbers that have been discussed so far are still a significant distance from that range , so more ambition is needed on behalf of industrialised countries if we are to get a robust response to climate change . "
looking ahead to the copenhagen summit , de boer called for more clarity and commitment if a successful global deal on climate change was to be reached .
" firstly we need clarity on the individual emission reduction targets to be adopted by industrialised countries , secondly we need clarity on what major developing countries will do to limit the growth of their emissions , " said de boer .
developing countries bear the brunt the un climate chief added the copenhagen summit had to deliver clarity on finance .
developing countries were to receive financial support to allow them to engage on mitigation to limit the growth of their emissions .

but ngos say the measures are not sufficient to tackle the roots of poorer nations ' problems . the european union 's executive arm will pull forward aid to developing nations hard hit by the worldwide economic crisis .
" those least responsible for the financial crisis are among those worst hit by its economic effects , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
the european commission said it would bring forward 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in resources to 2009 previously earmarked to help poor countries fight a recession that has staunched credit flows , curtailed investment and sent a number of local currencies into a tailspin .
development commissioner louis michel said advancing money allowed the aid " to have an impact when it is most needed . "
the commission said it will speed up three billion euros , or 72 percent of its budget support to african , pacific and caribbean nations .
it will direct at least 500 million euros to support local welfare spending .
in addition , 800 million euros from an existing facility to combat hunger will be made available this year .
however , the eu will not provide additional funds .
" we did n't come here to announce to you any huge new sums , " michel said .
" of course our ambitions are limited .
but we are going to keep putting the pressure on . "
eu measures " an empty package " aid organizations , though , have criticized the eu plans .
the european ngo confederation for relief and development , concord , said the measures fell " far short " of what was needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change has hit developing nations particularly hard " less than one week after the g20 , the eu has produced a strategy that fails to address the underlying flaws in the system that we know fuel poverty in developing countries , " said concord 's eu policy officer ester asin-martinez .
the international anti-poverty agency actionaid said the plans left many issues open .
" we 're not clear on how europe is actually going to soften the blow of the financial crisis in poor countries , " alexandre polack , actionaid 's head of european policy , said in a statement .
polack said the package had little solutions to the problems faced by developing countries .
" we have not seen any useful ideas coming out of this package on how to support developing countries in dealing with climate change , on stopping tax evasion or on coping with the effects of trade policies , " polack said .
" the commission demonstrated its good intentions today , but what it is offering is effectively an empty package . "
by frontloading aid , the eu left open what would happen in subsequent years .
" we fear that with no new money , poor countries will suffer in years to come , when aid dries up , " said hetty kovach , oxfam international 's policy advisor on aid .
" europe needs to dig deep to help prevent this crisis from becoming a humanitarian disaster . "
aid must be a joint eu effort g20 leaders last week in london agreed on an international strategy to pull the global economy out of crisis , including new moves to help poor nations .
europe is the biggest aid donor in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel says europe can help in relieving human suffering " i am proud that europe is first to act after the g20 in support of developing countries , " michel said .
the commission said it would focus on three main measures : " first , keeping our promises , " second , paying more quickly old money earmarked last year for developing countries , and third , having the commission and member states work more closely together to be more efficient .
barroso said no country could hold back .
" the recession must not , can not and will not be used as an excuse for going back on our promises to keep on increasing aid , " barroso said .
aid from the 27 nation bloc rose to 49 billion euros last year .
but aid volumes will need to increase to some 69 billion euros in 2010 to meet interim aid spending targets , the commission said .
" we are now more than half way to the 2015 deadline for reaching the un millennium development goals and some of the gains achieved so far risk being forfeited , leaving poor countries worse off than before the crisis , " barroso said .
world leaders of 189 countries agreed on the so-called millennium development goals in 2000 .
they consist of eight targets for reducing poverty by 2015 - including halving the number of people living on less than $ 1 a day . sac / rm , reuters / afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 08.04.2009 eu advances aid for developing nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large share of development aid goes towards food the european commission has outlined plans to bring forward development aid earmarked for later years .
but ngos say the measures are not sufficient to tackle the roots of poorer nations ' problems . the european union 's executive arm will pull forward aid to developing nations hard hit by the worldwide economic crisis .
" those least responsible for the financial crisis are among those worst hit by its economic effects , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
the european commission said it would bring forward 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in resources to 2009 previously earmarked to help poor countries fight a recession that has staunched credit flows , curtailed investment and sent a number of local currencies into a tailspin .
development commissioner louis michel said advancing money allowed the aid " to have an impact when it is most needed . "
the commission said it will speed up three billion euros , or 72 percent of its budget support to african , pacific and caribbean nations .
it will direct at least 500 million euros to support local welfare spending .
in addition , 800 million euros from an existing facility to combat hunger will be made available this year .
however , the eu will not provide additional funds .
" we did n't come here to announce to you any huge new sums , " michel said .
" of course our ambitions are limited .
but we are going to keep putting the pressure on . "
eu measures " an empty package " aid organizations , though , have criticized the eu plans .
the european ngo confederation for relief and development , concord , said the measures fell " far short " of what was needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change has hit developing nations particularly hard " less than one week after the g20 , the eu has produced a strategy that fails to address the underlying flaws in the system that we know fuel poverty in developing countries , " said concord 's eu policy officer ester asin-martinez .
the international anti-poverty agency actionaid said the plans left many issues open .
" we 're not clear on how europe is actually going to soften the blow of the financial crisis in poor countries , " alexandre polack , actionaid 's head of european policy , said in a statement .
polack said the package had little solutions to the problems faced by developing countries .
" we have not seen any useful ideas coming out of this package on how to support developing countries in dealing with climate change , on stopping tax evasion or on coping with the effects of trade policies , " polack said .
" the commission demonstrated its good intentions today , but what it is offering is effectively an empty package . "
by frontloading aid , the eu left open what would happen in subsequent years .
" we fear that with no new money , poor countries will suffer in years to come , when aid dries up , " said hetty kovach , oxfam international 's policy advisor on aid .
" europe needs to dig deep to help prevent this crisis from becoming a humanitarian disaster . "
aid must be a joint eu effort g20 leaders last week in london agreed on an international strategy to pull the global economy out of crisis , including new moves to help poor nations .
europe is the biggest aid donor in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel says europe can help in relieving human suffering " i am proud that europe is first to act after the g20 in support of developing countries , " michel said .
the commission said it would focus on three main measures : " first , keeping our promises , " second , paying more quickly old money earmarked last year for developing countries , and third , having the commission and member states work more closely together to be more efficient .
barroso said no country could hold back .
" the recession must not , can not and will not be used as an excuse for going back on our promises to keep on increasing aid , " barroso said .
aid from the 27 nation bloc rose to 49 billion euros last year .
but aid volumes will need to increase to some 69 billion euros in 2010 to meet interim aid spending targets , the commission said .

but ngos say the measures are not sufficient to tackle the roots of poorer nations ' problems . the european union 's executive arm will pull forward aid to developing nations hard hit by the worldwide economic crisis .
" those least responsible for the financial crisis are among those worst hit by its economic effects , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
the european commission said it would bring forward 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in resources to 2009 previously earmarked to help poor countries fight a recession that has staunched credit flows , curtailed investment and sent a number of local currencies into a tailspin .
development commissioner louis michel said advancing money allowed the aid " to have an impact when it is most needed . "
the commission said it will speed up three billion euros , or 72 percent of its budget support to african , pacific and caribbean nations .
it will direct at least 500 million euros to support local welfare spending .
in addition , 800 million euros from an existing facility to combat hunger will be made available this year .
however , the eu will not provide additional funds .
" we did n't come here to announce to you any huge new sums , " michel said .
" of course our ambitions are limited .
but we are going to keep putting the pressure on . "
eu measures " an empty package " aid organizations , though , have criticized the eu plans .
the european ngo confederation for relief and development , concord , said the measures fell " far short " of what was needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change has hit developing nations particularly hard " less than one week after the g20 , the eu has produced a strategy that fails to address the underlying flaws in the system that we know fuel poverty in developing countries , " said concord 's eu policy officer ester asin-martinez .
the international anti-poverty agency actionaid said the plans left many issues open .
" we 're not clear on how europe is actually going to soften the blow of the financial crisis in poor countries , " alexandre polack , actionaid 's head of european policy , said in a statement .
polack said the package had little solutions to the problems faced by developing countries .
" we have not seen any useful ideas coming out of this package on how to support developing countries in dealing with climate change , on stopping tax evasion or on coping with the effects of trade policies , " polack said .
" the commission demonstrated its good intentions today , but what it is offering is effectively an empty package . "
by frontloading aid , the eu left open what would happen in subsequent years .
" we fear that with no new money , poor countries will suffer in years to come , when aid dries up , " said hetty kovach , oxfam international 's policy advisor on aid .
" europe needs to dig deep to help prevent this crisis from becoming a humanitarian disaster . "
aid must be a joint eu effort g20 leaders last week in london agreed on an international strategy to pull the global economy out of crisis , including new moves to help poor nations .
europe is the biggest aid donor in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel says europe can help in relieving human suffering " i am proud that europe is first to act after the g20 in support of developing countries , " michel said .
the commission said it would focus on three main measures : " first , keeping our promises , " second , paying more quickly old money earmarked last year for developing countries , and third , having the commission and member states work more closely together to be more efficient .
barroso said no country could hold back .
" the recession must not , can not and will not be used as an excuse for going back on our promises to keep on increasing aid , " barroso said .
aid from the 27 nation bloc rose to 49 billion euros last year .
but aid volumes will need to increase to some 69 billion euros in 2010 to meet interim aid spending targets , the commission said .

the opposition is claiming fraud . riot police in moldova have seized the president 's office and parliament after the two buildings were stormed and occupied by anti-government protesters on tuesday . the police took control of the buildings in the early hours of wednesday after two straight days of demonstrations at the election victory of the ruling communist party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police were unable to control the protestors by the time authorities moved in , most protesters had already left , having ransacked president vladimir voronin offices and looted the parliament , where fires raged into the night .
the afp news agency reported that around a dozen remaining demonstrators were arrested . opposition supporters have vowed to return in force on wednesday . an estimated 10,000 mainly young protestors gathered in the capital chisinau for the second consecutive day on tuesday to dispute the communist party 's victory in sunday 's election . demonstrators claim the elections were fraudulent .
media reports said many at the rally were carrying european union , moldovan and romanian flags , chanting " moldova has awoken , " " we want to join europe , " and " we want to join romania . "
police used water cannons against the protestors but were unable to stop them from storming the parliament building and a presidential office , breaking windows , setting fire to furniture and throwing computers out onto the street .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova is one of europe 's poorest countries the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on tuesday he was " very concerned " about the situation in chisinau .
he appealed to both the government and protestors to remain calm .

" violence against government buildings is unacceptable .
equally important is the respect for the inalienable right of assembly of peaceful demonstrators . "
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he was concerned over the protests that had been " provoked " in moldova , according to the interfax news agency .
opposition wants new elections international monitoring groups , including the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said the vote was generally democratic , with few violations of election law .
however , solana said preliminary findings by observers had noted that " further improvements were required to ensure an electoral process free from undue administrative interference and to increase public confidence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth of many protesters points to a generation gap opposition parties said they would continue their anti-communist protests until new elections had been called .
" the protests will continue until a date is set for new elections , " said chisinau mayor dorin chirtoaca , deputy head of the opposition liberal party which lost to the ruling communists in sunday 's election .
" we have asked international organizations to recognize the election results as invalid , " chirtoaca said .
" we support the protest action in the center of chisinau .
the protests are justified ; their participants are calling for justice to be restored . "
julian fruntasu , a spokesman for the opposition liberal democratic party of moldova , told the infotag news agency that the protests were justified " because the communists lost the elections . "

the opposition is claiming fraud . riot police in moldova have seized the president 's office and parliament after the two buildings were stormed and occupied by anti-government protesters on tuesday . the police took control of the buildings in the early hours of wednesday after two straight days of demonstrations at the election victory of the ruling communist party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police were unable to control the protestors by the time authorities moved in , most protesters had already left , having ransacked president vladimir voronin offices and looted the parliament , where fires raged into the night .
the afp news agency reported that around a dozen remaining demonstrators were arrested . opposition supporters have vowed to return in force on wednesday . an estimated 10,000 mainly young protestors gathered in the capital chisinau for the second consecutive day on tuesday to dispute the communist party 's victory in sunday 's election . demonstrators claim the elections were fraudulent .
media reports said many at the rally were carrying european union , moldovan and romanian flags , chanting " moldova has awoken , " " we want to join europe , " and " we want to join romania . "
police used water cannons against the protestors but were unable to stop them from storming the parliament building and a presidential office , breaking windows , setting fire to furniture and throwing computers out onto the street .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova is one of europe 's poorest countries the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on tuesday he was " very concerned " about the situation in chisinau .
he appealed to both the government and protestors to remain calm .
" i call on all sides to refrain from violence and provocation , " solana said in a statement released tuesday .
" violence against government buildings is unacceptable .
equally important is the respect for the inalienable right of assembly of peaceful demonstrators . "
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he was concerned over the protests that had been " provoked " in moldova , according to the interfax news agency .
opposition wants new elections international monitoring groups , including the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said the vote was generally democratic , with few violations of election law .
however , solana said preliminary findings by observers had noted that " further improvements were required to ensure an electoral process free from undue administrative interference and to increase public confidence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth of many protesters points to a generation gap opposition parties said they would continue their anti-communist protests until new elections had been called .
" the protests will continue until a date is set for new elections , " said chisinau mayor dorin chirtoaca , deputy head of the opposition liberal party which lost to the ruling communists in sunday 's election .
" we have asked international organizations to recognize the election results as invalid , " chirtoaca said .
" we support the protest action in the center of chisinau .
the protests are justified ; their participants are calling for justice to be restored . "
julian fruntasu , a spokesman for the opposition liberal democratic party of moldova , told the infotag news agency that the protests were justified " because the communists lost the elections . "

the opposition is claiming fraud . riot police in moldova have seized the president 's office and parliament after the two buildings were stormed and occupied by anti-government protesters on tuesday . the police took control of the buildings in the early hours of wednesday after two straight days of demonstrations at the election victory of the ruling communist party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police were unable to control the protestors by the time authorities moved in , most protesters had already left , having ransacked president vladimir voronin offices and looted the parliament , where fires raged into the night .
the afp news agency reported that around a dozen remaining demonstrators were arrested . opposition supporters have vowed to return in force on wednesday . an estimated 10,000 mainly young protestors gathered in the capital chisinau for the second consecutive day on tuesday to dispute the communist party 's victory in sunday 's election . demonstrators claim the elections were fraudulent .
media reports said many at the rally were carrying european union , moldovan and romanian flags , chanting " moldova has awoken , " " we want to join europe , " and " we want to join romania . "
police used water cannons against the protestors but were unable to stop them from storming the parliament building and a presidential office , breaking windows , setting fire to furniture and throwing computers out onto the street .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova is one of europe 's poorest countries the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana said on tuesday he was " very concerned " about the situation in chisinau .
he appealed to both the government and protestors to remain calm .
" i call on all sides to refrain from violence and provocation , " solana said in a statement released tuesday .
" violence against government buildings is unacceptable .
equally important is the respect for the inalienable right of assembly of peaceful demonstrators . "
russia 's deputy foreign minister grigory karasin said he was concerned over the protests that had been " provoked " in moldova , according to the interfax news agency .
opposition wants new elections international monitoring groups , including the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , said the vote was generally democratic , with few violations of election law .
however , solana said preliminary findings by observers had noted that " further improvements were required to ensure an electoral process free from undue administrative interference and to increase public confidence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth of many protesters points to a generation gap opposition parties said they would continue their anti-communist protests until new elections had been called .
" the protests will continue until a date is set for new elections , " said chisinau mayor dorin chirtoaca , deputy head of the opposition liberal party which lost to the ruling communists in sunday 's election .
" we have asked international organizations to recognize the election results as invalid , " chirtoaca said .
" we support the protest action in the center of chisinau .
the protests are justified ; their participants are calling for justice to be restored . "
julian fruntasu , a spokesman for the opposition liberal democratic party of moldova , told the infotag news agency that the protests were justified " because the communists lost the elections . "
opposition parties said the vote was inherently unfair , as the election campaign was conducted with strong communist party control of major media and regional governments . nw / sac / msh / ncy , afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opposition is claiming fraud . riot police in moldova have seized the president 's office and parliament after the two buildings were stormed and occupied by anti-government protesters on tuesday . the police took control of the buildings in the early hours of wednesday after two straight days of demonstrations at the election victory of the ruling communist party .

media reports said many at the rally were carrying european union , moldovan and romanian flags , chanting " moldova has awoken , " " we want to join europe , " and " we want to join romania . "

the opposition is claiming fraud . riot police in moldova have seized the president 's office and parliament after the two buildings were stormed and occupied by anti-government protesters on tuesday . the police took control of the buildings in the early hours of wednesday after two straight days of demonstrations at the election victory of the ruling communist party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police were unable to control the protestors by the time authorities moved in , most protesters had already left , having ransacked president vladimir voronin offices and looted the parliament , where fires raged into the night .
the afp news agency reported that around a dozen remaining demonstrators were arrested . opposition supporters have vowed to return in force on wednesday . an estimated 10,000 mainly young protestors gathered in the capital chisinau for the second consecutive day on tuesday to dispute the communist party 's victory in sunday 's election . demonstrators claim the elections were fraudulent .
media reports said many at the rally were carrying european union , moldovan and romanian flags , chanting " moldova has awoken , " " we want to join europe , " and " we want to join romania . "
police used water cannons against the protestors but were unable to stop them from storming the parliament building and a presidential office , breaking windows , setting fire to furniture and throwing computers out onto the street .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 08.04.2009 unrest in moldova brings complicated state into international focus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-communist protests have dragged moldova into the spotlight the current unrest in moldova over disputed election results has turned the international spotlight on the small former soviet state and its complicated relationship with europe and russia . for a lot of people , it is the first time that this complicated country has entered the modern consciousness .
but for many centuries , the republic of moldova , to give its full name , has been at the center of numerous power struggles on europe 's eastern fringes .
way back in the middle ages , the territory which is modern day moldova was part of the principality of moldavia .
it was then part of the russian empire from 1812 until the russian revolution in 1917 before becoming part of romania .
its stewardship changed hands a number of times during world war ii until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1944 .
it remained a part of the ussr until the fall of the soviet union and survived a short but bloody civil war before gaining its independence in 1991 .
since then , moldova has struggled to produce a stable economy and is currently one of the poorest nations in europe .
but despite its economic strife and its checkered history , moldova has been relatively peaceful over the last 18 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova has been caught up in regional power-struggles for centuries all of which led to a certain amount of surprise when protesters ransacked communist president vladimir voronin 's office and the parliament building during demonstrations over allegedly rigged parliamentary elections on tuesday .
the violence seemed to erupt from nowhere , but the protests that rocked moldova reflected tensions that have long been simmering in a poor corner of europe perched on the east-west fault line .
" the deeper causes go back to questions of identity and what moldova 's future is , " samuel greene , deputy director at the carnegie center in moscow , told deutsche welle .
" moldova is still suffering from the aftermath of a civil war and it does n't have full sovereignty over its territory .
in addition , in order to keep the peace voronin has struck a compromise with russia by which it promises basically not to move towards unification with romania , which was being discussed at some point ; it promises to really not look that seriously at european union membership and certainly not to look at nato membership . "
compromises hinder moldovan progress , say critics greene believes that many moldovans accuse the communist government 's compliance with russian demands of holding the country back and that has led , to a certain degree , to the violent protests .
" these compromises have closed off socio-economic prospects for a large part of the moldovan population that really did n't have a hand in making those compromises and did n't necessarily approve of those compromises , " he said .
" when the ruling group that had made those compromises and essentially closed that door for moldova announces that it is trying to stay in power indefinitely and at any cost and any means , it can lead to a certain amount of emotion and maybe even desperation .
what we 're seeing now is a sort of ' now or never ' situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 5,000 demonstrators stormed the palace and parliament with voronin 's communist party likely to remain in power despite doubts over the validity of the vote , there is concern that the protests could continue and even escalate .
however , greene believes that moldova has seen enough violence .
" i do n't think that we would see the return to violence and civil war , " he said .
" i think most people in moldova have been fairly shocked by the violence of these protests and have seemed not to have approved of that degree of violence .
i think that if there are further protests they are likely to a lot more peaceful . "
president 's balancing act causing frustration many experts think that the reasons for the sudden outbursts can be traced to the complicated relationship , cultivated by voronin , between moldova , the eu and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has made concessions to russia voronin , a soviet-era interior minister for moldova , has in recent years reinvented himself as " pro-eu " leader interested in forging strong ties with the west .
under his leadership , moldova has implemented the first three-year action plan within the framework of the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- which precedes accession talks .
and the eu , pushed in particular by its newest members from the former soviet bloc in eastern europe , has supported voronin , promising as recently as october to seal a " new and ambitious " relationship with moldova .
a year earlier , the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia issued a joint statement pushing the eu to " acknowledge the pace of progress , moldova 's efforts and concrete achievements " under voronin 's leadership .
while turning to the west , voronin has also managed to keep relations with moscow - the supporter of the rebel transnistra region in eastern moldova - on a very warm track , also with support from the russian side .
moldova standing at east-west crossroads with voronin courting both brussels and moscow , and both sides reciprocating his overtures , each anxious not to cede dominant influence to the other , the stage was set for some kind of rupture within the country itself .
many moldovans believe that their country is going to have to make a choice : is it with europe or is it with russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin has positioned moldova between the eu and russia " well , it 's a balancing act and to be honest , russia is incredibly important for moldova 's stability because it does control the fate of the breakaway republican interests in transnistra and it 's also important for moldova 's economy , " greene said .
" moldova 's economy depends tremendously on remittances from moldovans working abroad - a large number of those are in russia - and so that is obviously important to any moldovan government .
" but a large number of those workers are in europe and europe is a significantly more lucrative place for them to be than in russia , " he added .
" it is also impossible for any moldovan government to entirely close the door on europe .
but what voronin has tried to do is this balancing act which over time evolves basically into institutionalized indecisiveness that says ' we 're not going to move in any direction ' and that makes it very difficult for foreigners to invest in moldova and for people to develop the economy when you have no idea what the long term prospects for the country are . "
the eu will on may 7 launch the so-called " eastern partnership " program of closer ties with moldova along with ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan , armenia , and belarus .
the plan envisages aid , the gradual creation of a free trade zone and better energy ties .
the eu will also negotiate accords setting terms for cooperation in reward for democratic and free-market reforms .
will these initiatives sway the communists towards europe or lead to another power struggle to join the many that have gone before it in moldova 's history ?
how the new moldovan government and its russian overseers respond to these developments , only time will tell .

a compromise is needed soon if a global action plan against climate change is to be signed at the copenhagen summit in december . eleven days of un-led climate talks in the german city of bonn have ended without making any visible progress toward a global action against climate change .
the talks , which included some 2,700 representatives from 180 countries , were the latest in a series of un-led meetings meant to forge a deal in copenhagen in december to replace or extend the kyoto protocol .
some participants said the deadlock at the bonn meeting was reminiscent of the chicken and egg problem .
industrialized and developing countries were loath to make concrete commitments and appeared to be waiting for the other side to make the first move .
the main quarrel , which also emerged again at the bonn meeting , was about carbon emission targets and financing the battle against climate change .
row over emission targets and funds " i would n't say these talks have been successful .
one of the things countries were supposed to agree on was an overall target for developed countries but this was not achieved .
so i would say we 're coming out of the negotiations with not much more than we went in with , " said stephanie tunmore , a climate campaigner for greenpeace international . developing countries had hoped the meeting would set a range of emissions reduction targets for the group of industrialized nations as a whole .
developed countries , however , preffered to procrastinate until other talks on technical issues were concluded , for example on how far they could offset their emissions and count the effect of planting trees .
us policy shift signals hope however , not all was gloom and doom in bonn .
delegates did give their general backing to some specific technical proposals , such as the formation of a registry to measure and reward climate action in developing countries , and delegates were also heartened by the more constructive approach taken by the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the previous us administration under george w. bush refused to sign the kyoto protocol " it was really refreshing to get this attitude from a us delegation that spent the last eight years stalling and refusing to act .
so i think you could definitely say that within the negotiations there has been a subtle change in atmosphere that even if they 're not actually doing the work yet , the trust is starting to get rebuilt , " said tunmore .
the united states ' commitments are considered key to climate negotiations , however , president barack obama 's fledgling administration has not made any specific pledges yet .
the european union plans to reduce greenhouse gases by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .
more ambitious carbon reduction targets needed but the united nations ' climate chief yvo de boer indicated during wednesday 's press conference in bonn that even these targets might not suffice to effectively combat climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's head of climate change yvo de boer is calling on industrialized nations to further cut greenhouse gases " the intergovernmental panel on climate change has indicated that if we want to avoid severe impact of climate change we need to be working towards industrialised country emission reductions in the order of minus 25-40 by 2020 , " de boer said .
" the numbers that have been discussed so far are still a significant distance from that range , so more ambition is needed on behalf of industrialised countries if we are to get a robust response to climate change . "
looking ahead to the copenhagen summit , de boer called for more clarity and commitment if a successful global deal on climate change was to be reached .
" firstly we need clarity on the individual emission reduction targets to be adopted by industrialised countries , secondly we need clarity on what major developing countries will do to limit the growth of their emissions , " said de boer .
developing countries bear the brunt the un climate chief added the copenhagen summit had to deliver clarity on finance .
developing countries were to receive financial support to allow them to engage on mitigation to limit the growth of their emissions .
however , de boer emphasised that it was just as important that developing countries received financial support in order to adapt to the impact of climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries are bearing the brunt of climate change which often results in drought and flooding environment and development groups have been urging swifter action for years .
many warn that unabated climate change will cause human suffering far worse than the present financial crisis .
developing countries are likely to bear the brunt since many are situated in areas where desertification and flooding already constitute signficant problems .
the next un climate gathering is scheduled for june .
that meeting marks a deadline to start formal negotiations .
de boer has said that a negotiating text would be on the table by then , enabling a successful conclusion of climate talks at the copenhagen summit in december . nk / th , dpa / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but ngos say the measures are not sufficient to tackle the roots of poorer nations ' problems . the european union 's executive arm will pull forward aid to developing nations hard hit by the worldwide economic crisis .
" those least responsible for the financial crisis are among those worst hit by its economic effects , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
the european commission said it would bring forward 4.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- in resources to 2009 previously earmarked to help poor countries fight a recession that has staunched credit flows , curtailed investment and sent a number of local currencies into a tailspin .
development commissioner louis michel said advancing money allowed the aid " to have an impact when it is most needed . "
the commission said it will speed up three billion euros , or 72 percent of its budget support to african , pacific and caribbean nations .
it will direct at least 500 million euros to support local welfare spending .
in addition , 800 million euros from an existing facility to combat hunger will be made available this year .
however , the eu will not provide additional funds .
" we did n't come here to announce to you any huge new sums , " michel said .
" of course our ambitions are limited .
but we are going to keep putting the pressure on . "
eu measures " an empty package " aid organizations , though , have criticized the eu plans .
the european ngo confederation for relief and development , concord , said the measures fell " far short " of what was needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change has hit developing nations particularly hard " less than one week after the g20 , the eu has produced a strategy that fails to address the underlying flaws in the system that we know fuel poverty in developing countries , " said concord 's eu policy officer ester asin-martinez .
the international anti-poverty agency actionaid said the plans left many issues open .
" we 're not clear on how europe is actually going to soften the blow of the financial crisis in poor countries , " alexandre polack , actionaid 's head of european policy , said in a statement .
polack said the package had little solutions to the problems faced by developing countries .
" we have not seen any useful ideas coming out of this package on how to support developing countries in dealing with climate change , on stopping tax evasion or on coping with the effects of trade policies , " polack said .
" the commission demonstrated its good intentions today , but what it is offering is effectively an empty package . "
by frontloading aid , the eu left open what would happen in subsequent years .
" we fear that with no new money , poor countries will suffer in years to come , when aid dries up , " said hetty kovach , oxfam international 's policy advisor on aid .
" europe needs to dig deep to help prevent this crisis from becoming a humanitarian disaster . "
aid must be a joint eu effort g20 leaders last week in london agreed on an international strategy to pull the global economy out of crisis , including new moves to help poor nations .
europe is the biggest aid donor in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis michel says europe can help in relieving human suffering " i am proud that europe is first to act after the g20 in support of developing countries , " michel said .
the commission said it would focus on three main measures : " first , keeping our promises , " second , paying more quickly old money earmarked last year for developing countries , and third , having the commission and member states work more closely together to be more efficient .
barroso said no country could hold back .
" the recession must not , can not and will not be used as an excuse for going back on our promises to keep on increasing aid , " barroso said .
aid from the 27 nation bloc rose to 49 billion euros last year .
but aid volumes will need to increase to some 69 billion euros in 2010 to meet interim aid spending targets , the commission said .
" we are now more than half way to the 2015 deadline for reaching the un millennium development goals and some of the gains achieved so far risk being forfeited , leaving poor countries worse off than before the crisis , " barroso said .
world leaders of 189 countries agreed on the so-called millennium development goals in 2000 .
they consist of eight targets for reducing poverty by 2015 - including halving the number of people living on less than $ 1 a day . sac / rm , reuters / afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the subsidy has proven to be an especially successful instrument , " wilhelm said , referring to the 40 percent rise in car sales observed in march . " for this reason the coalition has agreed to an extension and an increase in funds .

these include falling sales at car parts retailers , auto repair shops and used-car dealers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the scheme does not benefit high-end german brands other detractors point out that small carmakers , especially from asia , have benefitted most from the incentive plan , while major german luxury brands , such as daimler and bmw , have reaped little reward . some members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union had opposed extending the bonus payments on cost grounds , warning that pumping more money into the scheme would only prolong germany 's worst economic downturn since world war ii . economic stimulus measures introduced by the german government are already expected to create 40-50 billion euros of new debt this year . but with some 40 million motorists driving to the polls for national elections in september , it seems few leading politicians in berlin are willing to oppose such a popular subsidy scheme . sje / pfd , dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government says those suspected of collaborating with the pakistani army in the killing and rape of thousands of civilians will be put on trial .
the party which fought for independence in 1971 , the awami league , has recently been returned to power .
the plan is opposed by one of the main opposition parties , jamaat-e-islami .
its leaders are among those accused of alleged war crimes .
the government says the setting up of a prosecution team is the start of the process that will eventually lead to the trial of hundreds of people for war crimes , crimes against humanity and maybe even genocide .
it says these crimes were committed in 1971 by the pakistan army and their locally raised militia , when they embarked on a campaign to hold on to what was then the country 's eastern province by terrorising its civilian population .
the plan failed , but not before countless killings and rapes .
bangladesh says three million people died , though some historians dispute this figure saying it does not take into account people who fled the conflict into india and then did not return afterwards .
many collaborators were jailed after the war , but the issue was quietly dropped as consecutive governments preferred not to re-open old wounds .
it has now become a major political issue , because the party which fought for independence , the awami league recently returned to power with a huge majority .
one of its main opponents , jamaat-e-islami , the country 's largest religious party , also opposed the creation of bangladesh .
jamaat 's leaders are among those accused of carrying out war crimes , but they say they are innocent , and that now they are being persecuted .
