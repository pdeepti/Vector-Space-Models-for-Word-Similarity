moscow has reacted furiously to plans by the former administration of george w. bush to place missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic , saying the move was directly aimed against russia .
" i am counting on the new us administration behaving on this question in a more creative and friendly way , " medvedev said in an interview with spanish media , the transcript of which was published on the kremlin website .
" we have already received positive signals from our american colleagues .
i am expecting that these signals will turn into concrete proposals , " he added .
medvedev said he hoped that this issue would be discussed in his first meeting with obama , expected to take place on the sidelines of the meeting of g20 countries in london on april 2 .
the russian president had warned last year russia would deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian enclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .
the bush administration said its plans to build a radar base in the czech republic and install interceptor missiles in poland were not directed against russia but aimed at countering missile threats from states such as iran .
" russia does not like this , that is absolutely clear , " said medvedev .
medvedev urges us to face threats with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said bush was immovable on the missile shield he said it was undeniable that there were threats to international security in the world .
" but let us react to these threats together , without isolating each other from these processes . "
medvedev complained that the bush administration 's attitude had been " very simple : ' we are doing this because we have decided it that way . " '
russian officials have repeatedly expressed optimism for the prospects for ties under obama , although the new us president has yet to give much detail on his plans for russia policies .
however a pattern could emerge in the near future , with us secretary of state hillary clinton due to have her first face-to-face meeting with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov next week .
russia 's war in georgia in august over the breakaway region of south ossetia sent relations between russia and the west plummeting to lows not seen since the collapse of the soviet union .
us vice president joe biden declared at a security conference last month it was time to " press the reset button " in relations and " revisit the many areas where we can and should work together .

just hours before polls opened , basque police arrested a suspected eta member they believe was planning a bomb attack timed to coincide with the vote .
a total of around four million people are eligible to vote to elect regional parliaments in what are the first elections since the socialist party of prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero was returned to power one year ago .
since then , the global financial crisis has accelerated the collapse of spain 's property market after a decade-long boom , pushing the country into recession .
the unemployment rate soared to 13.9 percent in the last quarter of 2008 , the highest in the 27-nation european union .
in sunday 's polls , zapatero will be seeking to measure the degree of support he has to handle the crisis .
opinion polls indicate the socialists could end the 30-year hold on power by the basque nationalist party in the northern basque region .
historic socialist victory a possibility a socialist victory in the wealthy semi-autonomous region would mark the first time since the country returned to democracy in 1975 that the basque country is governed by a party that unquestionably backs keeping it as part of spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's socialists want the basques to remain spanish analysts credit the rise in support for the socialists in part to zapatero 's bid during his first term to negotiate peace with eta , blamed for 825 deaths in its 40-year campaign for an independent basque homeland .
those negotiations eventually failed and the group resumed its attacks .
spain 's supreme court last month banned two pro-independence parties from participating in sunday 's election due to their links to eta and its outlawed political wing batasuna .
eta responded to the court decision by staging its first attack in the spanish capital since december 2006 , setting off a van packed with explosives in a business district , causing extensive damage but no injuries .
late last month week , another eta bomb exploded outside the headquarters of the basque socialist party in the town of lazkao , causing major damage but no injuries .
the bombings raised fears that the regional election could be marred by further eta attacks .
the basque interior ministry said it is deploying 5,000 police throughout the region sunday , or more than half of its entire force of 8,000 .

in what became known as the " velvet divorce , " czechoslovakia dismembered in 1993 to form the czech republic and slovakia .
the two new states joined the eu nine years later .
dodik said the " federal units " of bosnia should be able to resort to self-determination after " five to 10 years . "
the dayton peace agreement ended bosnia 's 1992-1995 war and left the former yugoslav republic divided into two entities , the serb-run republika srpska and muslim-croat federation .
under the terms of the accord , each region has its own government , parliament and police , but neither is allowed to secede .
the latest political crisis erupted last month after it was reported that dodik and other bosnian serb politicians were the subject of a corruption probe .
justice authorities have yet to confirm the existence of a case against dodik , but bosnian serb leaders unanimously condemned what they called " illegal procedures " against their entity .
they have even threatened to leave central institutions , which would cause them to be blocked as the representatives of all three of bosnia 's main ethnic groups - muslims , croats , and serbs - must be present for them to function .
bosnian serb pm threatens split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik says that any split would be permanent " if we walk out , we will never come back , " dodik said in comments published in sarajevo 's dnevni avaz on friday .
he denounced as " farcical " the investigation that has been launched against him , adding : " i lost the little confidence i had in the bosnian state . "
observers say the developments illustrate the fragility of bosnia .
" whenever we are faced with political tensions , bosnia is confronted by the risk of collapsing and its existence is questioned , " political analyst tanja topic told reporters .
for srecko latal , another political commentator , bosnia 's two entities were like the two engines of a hybrid vehicle , which meant the balkan country was " always broken down . "
the crisis emerged as the leaders of the main political parties representing muslims , croats and serbs , including dodik , were engaged in talks aimed at finding common ground for eu-backed constitutional reforms .
" this crisis has long blocked the constitutional reform , " said topic .
the former yugoslav states of serbia and croatia , both involved in bosnia 's war and among the guarantors of the dayton peace agreement , are also involved in this crisis .

" we expect rapid international aid from all parties to completely rebuild gaza , " palestinian president mahmud abbas told reporters on saturday , feb .
28 . " we also expect that as in the past there will be one mechanism , the palestinian authority , " he said after meeting eu foreign policy chief javier solana in the west bank town of ramallah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has said it 's willing to work with abbas hamas has been boycotted by the major western donors , who consider it a terrorist organization and who deal exclusively with abbas ' moderate palestinian authority . the palestinian authority and hamas each want to lead the rebuilding effort , but western countries have said they will work only with abbas . " i would like to insist that the mechanism used to deploy the money is the one that represents the palestinian authority , " solana said .
" i do n't think there is a need for new mechanisms . " star delegate at the aid conference in the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh will us secretary of state hillary clinton , who will reportedly arrive bearing a check for $ 900 million -lrb- 710 million euros -rrb- . saudi arabia is expected to reaffirm a commitment to provide $ 1 billion towards reconstruction , and the european union has said it will grant $ 554 million to the palestinian people in 2009 . donor countries from the january 2008 paris conference will reiterate a pledge of $ 7.4 billion in aid to the palestinians in the three years 2008-2010 , of which $ 3 billion has so far been distributed . palestinian prime minister salam fayyad has said he is seeking $ 2.8 billion to rebuild gaza . around 75 delegations are scheduled to attend monday 's conference , which is organized by egypt and norway and sponsored by the united nations , european union , france , italy and the arab league . the 1.4-million population of the gaza strip - around half of whom depend on united nations handouts - are in dire need of help from the international community . gaza suffering under hamas-targeted measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since hamas took control of gaza , the situation has worsened the gaza economy was brought to its knees by the blockade imposed by israel from the time hamas seized control of the enclave . then israel 's 22-day onslaught on the territory in december and january caused physical devastation , destroying homes , hospitals , schools and other infrastructure as well as killing more than 1,300 palestinians . fayyad says the damage to homes has forced 90,000 people to live in tents now pitched amid the ruins . neither israel nor hamas will be represented at the gathering , but for the aid program to succeed israel must lift its blockade and hamas will have to be reconciled with the secular fatah , backbone of the palestinian authority . the rival palestinian factions have agreed to start talks aimed at working towards the formation of a " consensus " government . israeli prime minister ehud olmert has said his priority is the release of soldier gilad shalit from captivity by hamas , placing this aim above reaching a lasting truce in gaza or negotiating to lift the blockade . but egypt is continuing discussions aimed at trying to broker a long-term truce , and the middle east peace quartet will meet on the sidelines of the aid conference to discuss how to revive the peace process . clinton is expected to attend that event , as is solana , un head ban ki-moon and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said the aid conference has a double role : economic , to organize humanitarian aid and the reconstruction of gaza , and political , focused on the peace process . " the mechanism for the reconstruction will be fixed at sharm el-sheikh , " he said , but whatever is agreed can not be implemented until israel agrees to end its blockade and open border crossings into and out of gaza . high political price for hamas and israel rebuilding war-shattered gaza also carries a high political price for both israel and hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and fatah will have to cooperate to rebuild gaza hamas may need to come to terms with a return of the palestinian authority while israel could face growing pressure to reopen border crossings into gaza that have been closed since the hamas takeover to all but vital goods .
the israeli blockade was imposed in response to militant rocket and mortar fire . the blockade would have to be at least significantly eased to allow in the materials needed to rebuild the overcrowded coastal strip . and with such huge sums at stake , donors are bound to want results , not only in the daunting task of actually rebuilding gaza but also in the search for a solution to the seemingly intractable israeli-palestinian conflict . this could be particularly challenging at a time when israel 's hawkish likud leader benjamin netanyahu appears set to form a right-wing coalition government opposed to any significant concession to the palestinians .

" we expect rapid international aid from all parties to completely rebuild gaza , " palestinian president mahmud abbas told reporters on saturday , feb .
28 . " we also expect that as in the past there will be one mechanism , the palestinian authority , " he said after meeting eu foreign policy chief javier solana in the west bank town of ramallah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has said it 's willing to work with abbas hamas has been boycotted by the major western donors , who consider it a terrorist organization and who deal exclusively with abbas ' moderate palestinian authority . the palestinian authority and hamas each want to lead the rebuilding effort , but western countries have said they will work only with abbas . " i would like to insist that the mechanism used to deploy the money is the one that represents the palestinian authority , " solana said .
" i do n't think there is a need for new mechanisms . " star delegate at the aid conference in the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh will us secretary of state hillary clinton , who will reportedly arrive bearing a check for $ 900 million -lrb- 710 million euros -rrb- . saudi arabia is expected to reaffirm a commitment to provide $ 1 billion towards reconstruction , and the european union has said it will grant $ 554 million to the palestinian people in 2009 . donor countries from the january 2008 paris conference will reiterate a pledge of $ 7.4 billion in aid to the palestinians in the three years 2008-2010 , of which $ 3 billion has so far been distributed . palestinian prime minister salam fayyad has said he is seeking $ 2.8 billion to rebuild gaza . around 75 delegations are scheduled to attend monday 's conference , which is organized by egypt and norway and sponsored by the united nations , european union , france , italy and the arab league . the 1.4-million population of the gaza strip - around half of whom depend on united nations handouts - are in dire need of help from the international community . gaza suffering under hamas-targeted measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since hamas took control of gaza , the situation has worsened the gaza economy was brought to its knees by the blockade imposed by israel from the time hamas seized control of the enclave . then israel 's 22-day onslaught on the territory in december and january caused physical devastation , destroying homes , hospitals , schools and other infrastructure as well as killing more than 1,300 palestinians . fayyad says the damage to homes has forced 90,000 people to live in tents now pitched amid the ruins . neither israel nor hamas will be represented at the gathering , but for the aid program to succeed israel must lift its blockade and hamas will have to be reconciled with the secular fatah , backbone of the palestinian authority . the rival palestinian factions have agreed to start talks aimed at working towards the formation of a " consensus " government . israeli prime minister ehud olmert has said his priority is the release of soldier gilad shalit from captivity by hamas , placing this aim above reaching a lasting truce in gaza or negotiating to lift the blockade . but egypt is continuing discussions aimed at trying to broker a long-term truce , and the middle east peace quartet will meet on the sidelines of the aid conference to discuss how to revive the peace process . clinton is expected to attend that event , as is solana , un head ban ki-moon and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said the aid conference has a double role : economic , to organize humanitarian aid and the reconstruction of gaza , and political , focused on the peace process . " the mechanism for the reconstruction will be fixed at sharm el-sheikh , " he said , but whatever is agreed can not be implemented until israel agrees to end its blockade and open border crossings into and out of gaza . high political price for hamas and israel rebuilding war-shattered gaza also carries a high political price for both israel and hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and fatah will have to cooperate to rebuild gaza hamas may need to come to terms with a return of the palestinian authority while israel could face growing pressure to reopen border crossings into gaza that have been closed since the hamas takeover to all but vital goods .
the israeli blockade was imposed in response to militant rocket and mortar fire . the blockade would have to be at least significantly eased to allow in the materials needed to rebuild the overcrowded coastal strip . and with such huge sums at stake , donors are bound to want results , not only in the daunting task of actually rebuilding gaza but also in the search for a solution to the seemingly intractable israeli-palestinian conflict . this could be particularly challenging at a time when israel 's hawkish likud leader benjamin netanyahu appears set to form a right-wing coalition government opposed to any significant concession to the palestinians .

" we expect rapid international aid from all parties to completely rebuild gaza , " palestinian president mahmud abbas told reporters on saturday , feb .

" i would like to insist that the mechanism used to deploy the money is the one that represents the palestinian authority , " solana said .
" i do n't think there is a need for new mechanisms . " star delegate at the aid conference in the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh will us secretary of state hillary clinton , who will reportedly arrive bearing a check for $ 900 million -lrb- 710 million euros -rrb- . saudi arabia is expected to reaffirm a commitment to provide $ 1 billion towards reconstruction , and the european union has said it will grant $ 554 million to the palestinian people in 2009 . donor countries from the january 2008 paris conference will reiterate a pledge of $ 7.4 billion in aid to the palestinians in the three years 2008-2010 , of which $ 3 billion has so far been distributed . palestinian prime minister salam fayyad has said he is seeking $ 2.8 billion to rebuild gaza . around 75 delegations are scheduled to attend monday 's conference , which is organized by egypt and norway and sponsored by the united nations , european union , france , italy and the arab league . the 1.4-million population of the gaza strip - around half of whom depend on united nations handouts - are in dire need of help from the international community . gaza suffering under hamas-targeted measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since hamas took control of gaza , the situation has worsened the gaza economy was brought to its knees by the blockade imposed by israel from the time hamas seized control of the enclave . then israel 's 22-day onslaught on the territory in december and january caused physical devastation , destroying homes , hospitals , schools and other infrastructure as well as killing more than 1,300 palestinians . fayyad says the damage to homes has forced 90,000 people to live in tents now pitched amid the ruins . neither israel nor hamas will be represented at the gathering , but for the aid program to succeed israel must lift its blockade and hamas will have to be reconciled with the secular fatah , backbone of the palestinian authority . the rival palestinian factions have agreed to start talks aimed at working towards the formation of a " consensus " government . israeli prime minister ehud olmert has said his priority is the release of soldier gilad shalit from captivity by hamas , placing this aim above reaching a lasting truce in gaza or negotiating to lift the blockade . but egypt is continuing discussions aimed at trying to broker a long-term truce , and the middle east peace quartet will meet on the sidelines of the aid conference to discuss how to revive the peace process . clinton is expected to attend that event , as is solana , un head ban ki-moon and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said the aid conference has a double role : economic , to organize humanitarian aid and the reconstruction of gaza , and political , focused on the peace process . " the mechanism for the reconstruction will be fixed at sharm el-sheikh , " he said , but whatever is agreed can not be implemented until israel agrees to end its blockade and open border crossings into and out of gaza . high political price for hamas and israel rebuilding war-shattered gaza also carries a high political price for both israel and hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and fatah will have to cooperate to rebuild gaza hamas may need to come to terms with a return of the palestinian authority while israel could face growing pressure to reopen border crossings into gaza that have been closed since the hamas takeover to all but vital goods .
the israeli blockade was imposed in response to militant rocket and mortar fire . the blockade would have to be at least significantly eased to allow in the materials needed to rebuild the overcrowded coastal strip . and with such huge sums at stake , donors are bound to want results , not only in the daunting task of actually rebuilding gaza but also in the search for a solution to the seemingly intractable israeli-palestinian conflict . this could be particularly challenging at a time when israel 's hawkish likud leader benjamin netanyahu appears set to form a right-wing coalition government opposed to any significant concession to the palestinians . " for reconstruction to work , a new environment has to be established , " said palestinian planning minister samir abdallah .
" there has to be a climate of stability and security through a truce , but also a palestinian government that is trustworthy , " he said . hamas and abbas 's fatah faction agreed in egyptian-sponsored talks on thursday to work together towards setting up a unity government that will supervise gaza 's reconstruction . eu : donor conference an opportunity for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes the conference will provide a platform for debate solana said during a middle east tour ahead of the conference that the gathering would also be an opportunity to " create a political dynamic " in the israeli-palestinian talks .

" he insisted , however , that reconstruction would not be possible unless the blockade is lifted . " today one ca n't find a single bag of cement or steel bar in gaza , " he said . the international committee for the red cross stressed that efforts to rebuild gaza can only succeed if they are accompanied by credible political steps to resolve the crisis .

moscow has reacted furiously to plans by the former administration of george w. bush to place missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic , saying the move was directly aimed against russia .
" i am counting on the new us administration behaving on this question in a more creative and friendly way , " medvedev said in an interview with spanish media , the transcript of which was published on the kremlin website .
" we have already received positive signals from our american colleagues .
i am expecting that these signals will turn into concrete proposals , " he added .
medvedev said he hoped that this issue would be discussed in his first meeting with obama , expected to take place on the sidelines of the meeting of g20 countries in london on april 2 .
the russian president had warned last year russia would deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian enclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .
the bush administration said its plans to build a radar base in the czech republic and install interceptor missiles in poland were not directed against russia but aimed at countering missile threats from states such as iran .
" russia does not like this , that is absolutely clear , " said medvedev .
medvedev urges us to face threats with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said bush was immovable on the missile shield he said it was undeniable that there were threats to international security in the world .
" but let us react to these threats together , without isolating each other from these processes . "
medvedev complained that the bush administration 's attitude had been " very simple : ' we are doing this because we have decided it that way . " '
russian officials have repeatedly expressed optimism for the prospects for ties under obama , although the new us president has yet to give much detail on his plans for russia policies .
however a pattern could emerge in the near future , with us secretary of state hillary clinton due to have her first face-to-face meeting with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov next week .
russia 's war in georgia in august over the breakaway region of south ossetia sent relations between russia and the west plummeting to lows not seen since the collapse of the soviet union .
us vice president joe biden declared at a security conference last month it was time to " press the reset button " in relations and " revisit the many areas where we can and should work together .

just hours before polls opened , basque police arrested a suspected eta member they believe was planning a bomb attack timed to coincide with the vote .
a total of around four million people are eligible to vote to elect regional parliaments in what are the first elections since the socialist party of prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero was returned to power one year ago .
since then , the global financial crisis has accelerated the collapse of spain 's property market after a decade-long boom , pushing the country into recession .
the unemployment rate soared to 13.9 percent in the last quarter of 2008 , the highest in the 27-nation european union .
in sunday 's polls , zapatero will be seeking to measure the degree of support he has to handle the crisis .
opinion polls indicate the socialists could end the 30-year hold on power by the basque nationalist party in the northern basque region .
historic socialist victory a possibility a socialist victory in the wealthy semi-autonomous region would mark the first time since the country returned to democracy in 1975 that the basque country is governed by a party that unquestionably backs keeping it as part of spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's socialists want the basques to remain spanish analysts credit the rise in support for the socialists in part to zapatero 's bid during his first term to negotiate peace with eta , blamed for 825 deaths in its 40-year campaign for an independent basque homeland .
those negotiations eventually failed and the group resumed its attacks .
spain 's supreme court last month banned two pro-independence parties from participating in sunday 's election due to their links to eta and its outlawed political wing batasuna .
eta responded to the court decision by staging its first attack in the spanish capital since december 2006 , setting off a van packed with explosives in a business district , causing extensive damage but no injuries .
late last month week , another eta bomb exploded outside the headquarters of the basque socialist party in the town of lazkao , causing major damage but no injuries .
the bombings raised fears that the regional election could be marred by further eta attacks .
the basque interior ministry said it is deploying 5,000 police throughout the region sunday , or more than half of its entire force of 8,000 .
popular party running ruling socialists close in galicia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popular party lives up to its name in galicia in the rugged northwestern seafaring region of galicia , the socialists hope to hold on to the power they won in 2005 , but polls point to a tight race with the conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , spain 's main opposition party .
the election results could also determine the future of pp leader mariano rajoy , who has struggled with party infighting following two successive national election defeats .
rajoy has campaigned hard in his home region of galicia , but the party has been hit by allegations of corruption in madrid and several other regions involving businessmen close to the pp .
polling stations opened in the two regions at 09:00 cet and close at 20:00 cet , when local television stations are expected to release the results of exit polls .
the first official results from basque country are to be available at 21:30 cet , with final provisional results released 90 minutes later . nda / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just hours before polls opened , basque police arrested a suspected eta member they believe was planning a bomb attack timed to coincide with the vote .
a total of around four million people are eligible to vote to elect regional parliaments in what are the first elections since the socialist party of prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero was returned to power one year ago .
since then , the global financial crisis has accelerated the collapse of spain 's property market after a decade-long boom , pushing the country into recession .
the unemployment rate soared to 13.9 percent in the last quarter of 2008 , the highest in the 27-nation european union .
in sunday 's polls , zapatero will be seeking to measure the degree of support he has to handle the crisis .
opinion polls indicate the socialists could end the 30-year hold on power by the basque nationalist party in the northern basque region .
historic socialist victory a possibility a socialist victory in the wealthy semi-autonomous region would mark the first time since the country returned to democracy in 1975 that the basque country is governed by a party that unquestionably backs keeping it as part of spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's socialists want the basques to remain spanish analysts credit the rise in support for the socialists in part to zapatero 's bid during his first term to negotiate peace with eta , blamed for 825 deaths in its 40-year campaign for an independent basque homeland .
those negotiations eventually failed and the group resumed its attacks .
spain 's supreme court last month banned two pro-independence parties from participating in sunday 's election due to their links to eta and its outlawed political wing batasuna .
eta responded to the court decision by staging its first attack in the spanish capital since december 2006 , setting off a van packed with explosives in a business district , causing extensive damage but no injuries .
late last month week , another eta bomb exploded outside the headquarters of the basque socialist party in the town of lazkao , causing major damage but no injuries .
the bombings raised fears that the regional election could be marred by further eta attacks .
the basque interior ministry said it is deploying 5,000 police throughout the region sunday , or more than half of its entire force of 8,000 .

the election results could also determine the future of pp leader mariano rajoy , who has struggled with party infighting following two successive national election defeats .
rajoy has campaigned hard in his home region of galicia , but the party has been hit by allegations of corruption in madrid and several other regions involving businessmen close to the pp .

the deal reached sunday , march 1 , averted the danger of more wide-spread negotiators representing germany 's 16 state governments consented sunday to pay hikes of about 5 percent for government employees , averting more of the strikes that have disrupted education and other public services for weeks . the deal was reached after three earlier rounds of negotiations failed to end in an agreement on how to minimize inequality among staff in road maintenance offices , statistics bureaus , clinics , police stations and other public institutions . if union members accept the deal announced in potsdam , near berlin , by lower saxony finance minister hartmut moellring and verdi trade union leader frank bsirske , some 700,000 non-tenured employees would receive staged raises effective this week . the terms are likely to be extended to hundreds of thousands of other german public servants who work alongside unionized staff . one of the state premiers , peter harry carstensen of schleswig- holstein , said sunday he would grant the same rises to those state servants who enjoy tenure but lack the legal right to unionize and strike . german union have come under fire for seeking large wage increases during times of economic distress in europe 's largest economy and firms are struggling to avoid bankruptcy as demand drops and credit tightens . the unions have said the decisive wage hikes would put cash in people 's pockets and boost consumer spending . sms / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a networked society needs to stay online in every room and out on the road . the nifty little netbooks which have been selling like hot cakes since making a splash at the last cebit are the devices that live this dream : permanently connected to the internet via embedded umts , the fastest mobile-phone signal currently available . " they are also ultra-lightweight and have long battery life , " explained a salesman for asus , the taiwanese manufacturer which scored a big success last year with its simple little eee range . a netbook 's battery life should be long enough for " all-day computing , " defined by asus as an eight-hour day without a recharge . baby boomers like their tvs while these tiny computers grab all the attention , vendors have never completely given up on the idea that older internet users might prefer to surf the web using enormous flat-panel televisions . a key reason for this is the discovery that middle-aged people retain an almost obsessive affinity with their tv sets .
oddly , neither the old nor young people are quite as tv-centered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california will be the first state to be the official partner of the cebit trade fair klaus boehm of the us-based consultancy firm deloitte quotes from a recent international survey by his company .
pollsters discovered for example 75 percent of german baby boomers -lrb- the 44-60 age group -rrb- thought the tv , not the computer , was the most important device in their homes for hearing about the world outside . the survey , " the state of media democracy , " was conducted in five nations including the united states , japan and brazil . curiously , both mature people -lrb- over 60 -rrb- and the young put a higher value on computers as the best way to stay informed . as if to meet the needs of boomers , asus has announced the eee keyboard , a wireless computer that uses a tv screen , due for release at the end of this year 's second quarter . the product , first disclosed at the consumer electronics show -lrb- ces -rrb- this january in las vegas , has only a tiny 5-inch status display and is mainly a keyboard .
entertainment and web pages must be viewed on a television , connected to the device by wireless . exhibitor numbers plummet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california governor arnold schwarzenegger will open the cebit the number of exhibitors at the world 's biggest high-tech fair will be off by more than a quarter due to the impact of the global economic slump . some 4,300 firms from 69 countries will be displaying their latest gadgets , down from 5,845 companies last year , the fair 's host deutsche messe said in a statement . " given the depth of the world economic crisis , this number represents a success , " deutsche messe board member ernst raue said . he said some companies were returning after a long absence from the event in the northern city of hanover , including nokia siemens networks and e-commerce specialist intershop .
another 200 exhibitors are attending for the first time . this year 's cebit features california , the place where personal computing began , as special partner .

the deal reached sunday , march 1 , averted the danger of more wide-spread negotiators representing germany 's 16 state governments consented sunday to pay hikes of about 5 percent for government employees , averting more of the strikes that have disrupted education and other public services for weeks . the deal was reached after three earlier rounds of negotiations failed to end in an agreement on how to minimize inequality among staff in road maintenance offices , statistics bureaus , clinics , police stations and other public institutions . if union members accept the deal announced in potsdam , near berlin , by lower saxony finance minister hartmut moellring and verdi trade union leader frank bsirske , some 700,000 non-tenured employees would receive staged raises effective this week . the terms are likely to be extended to hundreds of thousands of other german public servants who work alongside unionized staff . one of the state premiers , peter harry carstensen of schleswig- holstein , said sunday he would grant the same rises to those state servants who enjoy tenure but lack the legal right to unionize and strike . german union have come under fire for seeking large wage increases during times of economic distress in europe 's largest economy and firms are struggling to avoid bankruptcy as demand drops and credit tightens . the unions have said the decisive wage hikes would put cash in people 's pockets and boost consumer spending . sms / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , 2005 the international tribunal to try suspects in the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri four years ago was formally constituted in the hague on sunday , march 1 . constituted under a united nations mandate , the court is to examine a number of issues , including allegations that syria was behind the killing of hariri in a massive beirut bomb blast on feb .
14 , 2005 . syria has repeatedly denied allegations of involvement in the hariri attack , in which 22 other people were also killed . court registrar robin vincent told the opening that the tribunal was in the first place not so much for the united nations or for the international community as " for lebanon . " a group of several dozen lebanese outside the heavily-fortified tribunal building - a former dutch secret service gym in the hague suburb of leidschendam-voorburg - waved national flags . historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saad hariri called march 1 a historic day of justice hariri 's son saad called the opening of the court a historic day for his country . " today the flag of justice for lebanon is being raised in the hague ; he said in a statement issued in beirut .
" march 1 is the fruit of the efforts of all lebanese people who supported the establishment of the court and who refused to yield to threats and terror . " four lebanese generals regarded as pro-syrian are expected to be charged by the hague court in connection with the murder .
a lebanese investigating judge friday rejected a request for their release . the four - mustafa hamdan , commander of the presidential guard , jamil sayyed , director of security services , domestic security head ali hajj , and the commander of army intelligence raymond azar - have been detained in lebanon since 2005 . canadian daniel bellemare assumed the role of the tribunal 's chief prosecutor .

bellemere has 60 days to apply to the lebanese authorities for the transfer of suspects and evidence files . the tribunal 's hearings are expected to last for several years , and it is expected that months will pass before anyone actually goes on trial . " indictments will be filed when i am satisfied i have enough evidence , " bellemare told reporters . the tribunal will operate under lebanese law - but without the death penalty - with an international panel of 11 judges and a staff of 300 under an initial mandate of three years .
the highest sentence it will be able to impose will be life imprisonment . it is financed to 49 percent by the lebanese government and 51 percent by donor nations including the united states and germany - to the tune of 40 million euros for the first year , financing which has already been guaranteed . open wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanon remains divided between supporters and opponents of syria with lebanese society still polarized into pro and anti-syrian camps , and having just emerged from an 18-month political stalemate , the tribunal is likely to aggravate wounds that have hardly healed . there is also opposition to the tribunal 's existence with some observers saying they think it could lead to conflicts in the streets similar to the ones witnessed during may 2008 , when 82 people were killed . the opposition has long claimed that the tribunal constitutes an unacceptable violation of lebanese sovereignty and that it can be politicized to serve as a tool against syria , their main ally . " the tribunal into the assassination of former prime minister rafik hariri should not be considered a tool for taking revenge or intimidation , " opposition deputy anwar al-khalil said . in comments made last week to the lebanese media , bellemare tried to assure all factions involved that the tribunal would not be a " political exercise " but " a legal process driven by legal rules . " previous un reports , including one written by german prosecutor detlev mehlis , have implicated the syrian intelligence establishment in the killing . assad has long denied any involvement in hariri 's killing and has said syria will not allow its citizens to appear before the tribunal . sms / dpa / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he then finished off a swift counter-attack down the left in the 25th for his 14th goal of the season . though he missed the last three games because of a knee injury , grafite has now found the back of the net nine goals in his last six league games . paulo guerrero gave the home side hope with a goal in the 73rd but dzeko chalked up his 11th of the season two minutes later to inflict a first home defeat of the season for hamburg . bayern ca n't capitalize visiting bayern were unable to take advantage of the dismissal of bremen central defender naldo in the 15th minute , leaving juergen klinsmann 's side with just one win in five league games since the winter break . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann , right , had hoped to see something better against bremen " we wanted the win to get nearer the leaders , but it is not a bad result and we can live with it , " klinsmann said . naldo was shown a red card after blocking bastian schweinsteiger just outside the area in what was deemed a professional foul . bayern created a series of chances , but a lack of precision and christian vander in goal in place of injured first-choice tim wiese thwarted hamit altintop , schweinsteiger drove narrowly over the bar and tim borowski went close and saw another effort saved by the keeper . the best opportunity went to bremen 's claudio pizarro who screwed a shot wide of an open goal with 18 minutes remaining . the result leaves bremen 11th and without a win in five games , but the point will be seen as another morale-booster by thomas schaaf 's side after coming from two goals down at ac milan on thursday to eliminate the italians from the uefa cup . " we deserved the point after playing for over 70 minutes with 10 men .
i do n't think you could expect any more than that today , " schaaf said . hertha 's close call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha had a hard time beating the bundealiga 's worst team in the day 's other game , seventh-placed vfb stuttgart earned a 2-0 win at second-to-bottom karlsruhe thanks to a goal five minutes after the break from brazilian elson and an 88th-minute strike from sami khedira . earlier in saturday 's bundesliga action , hertha berlin beat last-placed borussia moenchengladbach 2-1 and benefited from hoffenheim 's goalless draw at borussia dortmund . goals by andrey voronin and pal dardai gave berlin a comfortable half-time lead , but after arne friedrich brought down marko marin in the area and michael bradley scored from the spot in the 69th minute , hertha had a tough task on their hands to hold on to their lead . moenchengladbach threw caution to the win in the final minutes and would have deserved at least a share of the spoils as berlin showed none of the form that had taken them to the top of the standings . " it looked as if we simply forgot to play soccer in the second half , " voronin said .
" we did not deserve to win like that , but we got the three points . " room to move in dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp was disappointed by the the referees in dortmund , hoffenheim and the home side both ended the game with 10 men after referee herbert fandel sent off tobias weis and sebastian kehl in the second half . dortmund coach juergen klopp said there were many refereeing decisions during the game he could not understand . " kehl 's second booking was ridiculous and weis should also not have been sent off , " he said . hoffenheim 's andreas beck said that the side was trying to win matches , but was just not having any luck . " maybe we need to win a game with a bad 1-0 and then we can get back to our winning ways . " bayer leverkusen failed to close the gap on the leaders going down 1-0 at struggling hanover 96 , with the only goal of the game being scored by arnold bruggink . struggling schalke 04 managed a somewhat lucky 2-1 victory at eintracht frankfurt that sees them go to 34 points and keeps them challenging for an uefa cup place . at the wrong end of the table , vfl bochum twice came from behind to beat energie cottbus 3-2 to move to 14th in the table , while the visitors move down into the relegation zone in 16th . tt / sms / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a networked society needs to stay online in every room and out on the road . the nifty little netbooks which have been selling like hot cakes since making a splash at the last cebit are the devices that live this dream : permanently connected to the internet via embedded umts , the fastest mobile-phone signal currently available . " they are also ultra-lightweight and have long battery life , " explained a salesman for asus , the taiwanese manufacturer which scored a big success last year with its simple little eee range . a netbook 's battery life should be long enough for " all-day computing , " defined by asus as an eight-hour day without a recharge . baby boomers like their tvs while these tiny computers grab all the attention , vendors have never completely given up on the idea that older internet users might prefer to surf the web using enormous flat-panel televisions . a key reason for this is the discovery that middle-aged people retain an almost obsessive affinity with their tv sets .
oddly , neither the old nor young people are quite as tv-centered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california will be the first state to be the official partner of the cebit trade fair klaus boehm of the us-based consultancy firm deloitte quotes from a recent international survey by his company .
pollsters discovered for example 75 percent of german baby boomers -lrb- the 44-60 age group -rrb- thought the tv , not the computer , was the most important device in their homes for hearing about the world outside . the survey , " the state of media democracy , " was conducted in five nations including the united states , japan and brazil . curiously , both mature people -lrb- over 60 -rrb- and the young put a higher value on computers as the best way to stay informed . as if to meet the needs of boomers , asus has announced the eee keyboard , a wireless computer that uses a tv screen , due for release at the end of this year 's second quarter . the product , first disclosed at the consumer electronics show -lrb- ces -rrb- this january in las vegas , has only a tiny 5-inch status display and is mainly a keyboard .
entertainment and web pages must be viewed on a television , connected to the device by wireless . exhibitor numbers plummet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california governor arnold schwarzenegger will open the cebit the number of exhibitors at the world 's biggest high-tech fair will be off by more than a quarter due to the impact of the global economic slump . some 4,300 firms from 69 countries will be displaying their latest gadgets , down from 5,845 companies last year , the fair 's host deutsche messe said in a statement . " given the depth of the world economic crisis , this number represents a success , " deutsche messe board member ernst raue said . he said some companies were returning after a long absence from the event in the northern city of hanover , including nokia siemens networks and e-commerce specialist intershop .
another 200 exhibitors are attending for the first time . this year 's cebit features california , the place where personal computing began , as special partner .
german chancellor angela merkel and governor arnold schwarzenegger of california , the fair 's guest of honor , will open the event . tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson does not believe that the holocaust took place " if he 's silent , if he stays out of sight , that would really be better for everyone , " fellay said in the interview to appear on monday .
" i hope that he drops out of public life for a long while . "
williamson would be excluded from the community " if he starts again to deny the holocaust , " he added .
" he has hurt us and damaged our reputation .
we are definitely distancing ourselves from him , " fellay said .
in a letter to the vatican released thursday , williamson apologized for his recent comments about the holocaust - but did not say whether he 's changed his views or that his comments had been erroneous .
a step in the right direction ?
the vatican turned down the apology .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said on friday that williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set forth by the vatican under which the bishop was to " distance himself unequivocally and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wanted to be admitted as a prelate in the church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson ran an sspx seminary in la reja , argentina fellay , however , considered the letter a " major step in the right direction " and that , in his view , it was unlikely that the vatican would excommunicate williamson again .
in berlin , the president of germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knobloch said on friday she was " appalled " by williamson 's latest remarks , while the council 's secretary general , stephan kramer , said that the cleric 's apology was " completely irrelevant . " " he is sorry about the pain , but has taken back nothing of substance , " kramer said .
" i believe the apology is a diversion tactic to get rid of the pressure and the limelight , " allowing the brotherhood to continue preaching their " antidemocratic , unconstitutional , misogynist , antisemitic values . "

"
williamson returned to britain where he is believed to be staying with fellow priests at the offices of the society of saint pius x in the leafy southwest london suburb of wimbledon .
fellay and williamson were among four excommunicated bishops that pope benedict xvi rehabilitated last month in an attempt to heal a decades-old split with traditionalists who did not accept the reforms of the second vatican council of the early 1960s .
the vatican has said pope benedict had n't been aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he revoked his excommunication .
williamson , 68 , told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 01.03.2009 hariri tribunal starts work in netherlands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hariri was killed in a bomb explosion on feb .
14 , 2005 the international tribunal to try suspects in the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri four years ago was formally constituted in the hague on sunday , march 1 . constituted under a united nations mandate , the court is to examine a number of issues , including allegations that syria was behind the killing of hariri in a massive beirut bomb blast on feb .
14 , 2005 . syria has repeatedly denied allegations of involvement in the hariri attack , in which 22 other people were also killed . court registrar robin vincent told the opening that the tribunal was in the first place not so much for the united nations or for the international community as " for lebanon . " a group of several dozen lebanese outside the heavily-fortified tribunal building - a former dutch secret service gym in the hague suburb of leidschendam-voorburg - waved national flags . historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saad hariri called march 1 a historic day of justice hariri 's son saad called the opening of the court a historic day for his country . " today the flag of justice for lebanon is being raised in the hague ; he said in a statement issued in beirut .
" march 1 is the fruit of the efforts of all lebanese people who supported the establishment of the court and who refused to yield to threats and terror . " four lebanese generals regarded as pro-syrian are expected to be charged by the hague court in connection with the murder .
a lebanese investigating judge friday rejected a request for their release . the four - mustafa hamdan , commander of the presidential guard , jamil sayyed , director of security services , domestic security head ali hajj , and the commander of army intelligence raymond azar - have been detained in lebanon since 2005 . canadian daniel bellemare assumed the role of the tribunal 's chief prosecutor .
the 56-year-old had been the head un investigator in the case since november 2007 . trial likely to last years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will likely take years for the people of lebaon to know how hariri was killed bellemere pledged to do all in his power to get to the bottom of the assassination , and had already made clear before sunday 's formal opening of the tribunal that he would seek the transfer of the four generals from lebanon . the four have not been formally charged .
bellemere has 60 days to apply to the lebanese authorities for the transfer of suspects and evidence files . the tribunal 's hearings are expected to last for several years , and it is expected that months will pass before anyone actually goes on trial . " indictments will be filed when i am satisfied i have enough evidence , " bellemare told reporters . the tribunal will operate under lebanese law - but without the death penalty - with an international panel of 11 judges and a staff of 300 under an initial mandate of three years .
the highest sentence it will be able to impose will be life imprisonment . it is financed to 49 percent by the lebanese government and 51 percent by donor nations including the united states and germany - to the tune of 40 million euros for the first year , financing which has already been guaranteed . open wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanon remains divided between supporters and opponents of syria with lebanese society still polarized into pro and anti-syrian camps , and having just emerged from an 18-month political stalemate , the tribunal is likely to aggravate wounds that have hardly healed . there is also opposition to the tribunal 's existence with some observers saying they think it could lead to conflicts in the streets similar to the ones witnessed during may 2008 , when 82 people were killed . the opposition has long claimed that the tribunal constitutes an unacceptable violation of lebanese sovereignty and that it can be politicized to serve as a tool against syria , their main ally . " the tribunal into the assassination of former prime minister rafik hariri should not be considered a tool for taking revenge or intimidation , " opposition deputy anwar al-khalil said . in comments made last week to the lebanese media , bellemare tried to assure all factions involved that the tribunal would not be a " political exercise " but " a legal process driven by legal rules . " previous un reports , including one written by german prosecutor detlev mehlis , have implicated the syrian intelligence establishment in the killing . assad has long denied any involvement in hariri 's killing and has said syria will not allow its citizens to appear before the tribunal . sms / dpa / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson does not believe that the holocaust took place " if he 's silent , if he stays out of sight , that would really be better for everyone , " fellay said in the interview to appear on monday .
" i hope that he drops out of public life for a long while . "
williamson would be excluded from the community " if he starts again to deny the holocaust , " he added .
" he has hurt us and damaged our reputation .
we are definitely distancing ourselves from him , " fellay said .
in a letter to the vatican released thursday , williamson apologized for his recent comments about the holocaust - but did not say whether he 's changed his views or that his comments had been erroneous .
a step in the right direction ?
the vatican turned down the apology .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said on friday that williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set forth by the vatican under which the bishop was to " distance himself unequivocally and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wanted to be admitted as a prelate in the church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson ran an sspx seminary in la reja , argentina fellay , however , considered the letter a " major step in the right direction " and that , in his view , it was unlikely that the vatican would excommunicate williamson again .
in berlin , the president of germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knobloch said on friday she was " appalled " by williamson 's latest remarks , while the council 's secretary general , stephan kramer , said that the cleric 's apology was " completely irrelevant . " " he is sorry about the pain , but has taken back nothing of substance , " kramer said .
" i believe the apology is a diversion tactic to get rid of the pressure and the limelight , " allowing the brotherhood to continue preaching their " antidemocratic , unconstitutional , misogynist , antisemitic values . "
back in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being ousted by argentina , williamson returned to england the argentine government asked the bishop to leave the south american country - where he ran an sspx seminary 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires - because his remarks on the holocaust were seen as " deeply offensive to argentine society , the jewish people and humanity . "
williamson returned to britain where he is believed to be staying with fellow priests at the offices of the society of saint pius x in the leafy southwest london suburb of wimbledon .
fellay and williamson were among four excommunicated bishops that pope benedict xvi rehabilitated last month in an attempt to heal a decades-old split with traditionalists who did not accept the reforms of the second vatican council of the early 1960s .
the vatican has said pope benedict had n't been aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he revoked his excommunication .
williamson , 68 , told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "

" we suggest that bosnia be transformed into a federation in which the federal units shall have the right to self-determination , " bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik said .
" why should n't we go the way of czechoslovakia , and meet up in the european union , " he said saturday in an interview with a croatian daily , after several days of stern statements on the failure of bosnia .
in what became known as the " velvet divorce , " czechoslovakia dismembered in 1993 to form the czech republic and slovakia .
the two new states joined the eu nine years later .
dodik said the " federal units " of bosnia should be able to resort to self-determination after " five to 10 years . "
the dayton peace agreement ended bosnia 's 1992-1995 war and left the former yugoslav republic divided into two entities , the serb-run republika srpska and muslim-croat federation .
under the terms of the accord , each region has its own government , parliament and police , but neither is allowed to secede .
the latest political crisis erupted last month after it was reported that dodik and other bosnian serb politicians were the subject of a corruption probe .
justice authorities have yet to confirm the existence of a case against dodik , but bosnian serb leaders unanimously condemned what they called " illegal procedures " against their entity .
they have even threatened to leave central institutions , which would cause them to be blocked as the representatives of all three of bosnia 's main ethnic groups - muslims , croats , and serbs - must be present for them to function .

he denounced as " farcical " the investigation that has been launched against him , adding : " i lost the little confidence i had in the bosnian state . "
observers say the developments illustrate the fragility of bosnia .
" whenever we are faced with political tensions , bosnia is confronted by the risk of collapsing and its existence is questioned , " political analyst tanja topic told reporters .
for srecko latal , another political commentator , bosnia 's two entities were like the two engines of a hybrid vehicle , which meant the balkan country was " always broken down . "
the crisis emerged as the leaders of the main political parties representing muslims , croats and serbs , including dodik , were engaged in talks aimed at finding common ground for eu-backed constitutional reforms .
" this crisis has long blocked the constitutional reform , " said topic .
the former yugoslav states of serbia and croatia , both involved in bosnia 's war and among the guarantors of the dayton peace agreement , are also involved in this crisis .

14 , 2005 the international tribunal to try suspects in the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri four years ago was formally constituted in the hague on sunday , march 1 . constituted under a united nations mandate , the court is to examine a number of issues , including allegations that syria was behind the killing of hariri in a massive beirut bomb blast on feb .
14 , 2005 . syria has repeatedly denied allegations of involvement in the hariri attack , in which 22 other people were also killed . court registrar robin vincent told the opening that the tribunal was in the first place not so much for the united nations or for the international community as " for lebanon . " a group of several dozen lebanese outside the heavily-fortified tribunal building - a former dutch secret service gym in the hague suburb of leidschendam-voorburg - waved national flags . historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saad hariri called march 1 a historic day of justice hariri 's son saad called the opening of the court a historic day for his country . " today the flag of justice for lebanon is being raised in the hague ; he said in a statement issued in beirut .
" march 1 is the fruit of the efforts of all lebanese people who supported the establishment of the court and who refused to yield to threats and terror . " four lebanese generals regarded as pro-syrian are expected to be charged by the hague court in connection with the murder .
a lebanese investigating judge friday rejected a request for their release . the four - mustafa hamdan , commander of the presidential guard , jamil sayyed , director of security services , domestic security head ali hajj , and the commander of army intelligence raymond azar - have been detained in lebanon since 2005 . canadian daniel bellemare assumed the role of the tribunal 's chief prosecutor .

bellemere has 60 days to apply to the lebanese authorities for the transfer of suspects and evidence files . the tribunal 's hearings are expected to last for several years , and it is expected that months will pass before anyone actually goes on trial . " indictments will be filed when i am satisfied i have enough evidence , " bellemare told reporters . the tribunal will operate under lebanese law - but without the death penalty - with an international panel of 11 judges and a staff of 300 under an initial mandate of three years .

" the tribunal into the assassination of former prime minister rafik hariri should not be considered a tool for taking revenge or intimidation , " opposition deputy anwar al-khalil said . in comments made last week to the lebanese media , bellemare tried to assure all factions involved that the tribunal would not be a " political exercise " but " a legal process driven by legal rules . " previous un reports , including one written by german prosecutor detlev mehlis , have implicated the syrian intelligence establishment in the killing . assad has long denied any involvement in hariri 's killing and has said syria will not allow its citizens to appear before the tribunal . sms / dpa / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" eu leaders were also to use the summit to hammer out a common position to take to a meeting of leaders from the 20 biggest economic powers in london on april 2 .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek said sunday that eu leaders would meet with us president barack obama in prague three days after the g20 meeting . sharing the burden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmaker opel is among those looking for help upon his arrival in brussels , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said , " we should not be taking jobs from each other . " the main split in the union is between rich countries , which want strong action to support industry - particularly carmakers , and poorer nations - largely located in eastern and central europe , who can not afford massive industry bail-outs . eastern european nations have also been especially hard hit by the crisis .
hungary 's prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said the time had come for richer eu members to show their solidarity with poorer countries . " we should not allow a new iron curtain to be set up and divide europe in two parts , " he warned , proposing a fund worth up to 190 billion euros -lrb- $ 240 billion -rrb- . his proposal is substantially more than the 24.5 billion euros in aid that international institutions agreed on friday to make available to eastern european countries to help them cope with the crisis .
eastern and central european economies are often dependent on credit from western sources , which has become nearly impossible to receive . no special treatment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said international aid should be looked at on a case-by-case basis but there was little sympathy for the hungarian proposal .
the european union 's current czech presidency ruled out special treatment for the region . " i do n't believe that it is necessary now to separate several countries in the european union , " the czech republic 's topolanek told journalists as he arrived to chair the emergency eu summit , adding that such aid would be offered to any eu member , not only eastern european countries . " i think that it was perfectly clear that the european union is n't going to leave anybody in the lurch , " topolanek told journalists after the meeting . as the leader of the 27-member bloc 's largest economy , german chancellor angela merkel said her country was in favor of helping european countries on a case to case basis but she has not detailed how aid would be provided .
berlin has resisted calls for a euro-zone bond to raise money for suffering countries in the shared currency zone . merkel , who arrived late to the summit due to technical difficulties with her government plane , said the bloc could not afford to lump countries together solely according to their geographic location .
she said " the situation is very different " from one eastern european nation to another , and warned of starting a debate including " massive figures " of support for the region . auto industry protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's plan to help french carmakers has some worried many eastern european countries are also growing increasingly concerned about the possible return of protectionism .
french president nicolas sarkozy made aid to its car sector conditional on companies not moving production to the region and said french carmakers should work to preserve jobs in france .
on sunday , he denied the move was rooted in protectionism . " we did n't ask to close factories in other countries , but to keep ones at home open , " he said .
" protectionism is an american problem . " the european commission deemed the french auto package on saturday to be free of protectionism , but fears of governments deciding to bail out their industries at the expense of others were not diminished . " always we must resist the temptation of protectionism , " polish prime minister donald tusk told journalists after meeting of leaders from nine eastern european countries that took place ahead of the major summit . sms / afp / dpa / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the main split in the union is between rich countries , which want strong action to support industry - particularly carmakers , and poorer nations - largely located in eastern and central europe , who can not afford massive industry bail-outs . eastern european nations have also been especially hard hit by the crisis .
hungary 's prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said the time had come for richer eu members to show their solidarity with poorer countries . " we should not allow a new iron curtain to be set up and divide europe in two parts , " he warned , proposing a fund worth up to 190 billion euros -lrb- $ 240 billion -rrb- . his proposal is substantially more than the 24.5 billion euros in aid that international institutions agreed on friday to make available to eastern european countries to help them cope with the crisis .
eastern and central european economies are often dependent on credit from western sources , which has become nearly impossible to receive . no special treatment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said international aid should be looked at on a case-by-case basis but there was little sympathy for the hungarian proposal .
the european union 's current czech presidency ruled out special treatment for the region . " i do n't believe that it is necessary now to separate several countries in the european union , " the czech republic 's topolanek told journalists as he arrived to chair the emergency eu summit , adding that such aid would be offered to any eu member , not only eastern european countries . " i think that it was perfectly clear that the european union is n't going to leave anybody in the lurch , " topolanek told journalists after the meeting . as the leader of the 27-member bloc 's largest economy , german chancellor angela merkel said her country was in favor of helping european countries on a case to case basis but she has not detailed how aid would be provided .
berlin has resisted calls for a euro-zone bond to raise money for suffering countries in the shared currency zone . merkel , who arrived late to the summit due to technical difficulties with her government plane , said the bloc could not afford to lump countries together solely according to their geographic location .
she said " the situation is very different " from one eastern european nation to another , and warned of starting a debate including " massive figures " of support for the region . auto industry protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's plan to help french carmakers has some worried many eastern european countries are also growing increasingly concerned about the possible return of protectionism .
french president nicolas sarkozy made aid to its car sector conditional on companies not moving production to the region and said french carmakers should work to preserve jobs in france .
on sunday , he denied the move was rooted in protectionism . " we did n't ask to close factories in other countries , but to keep ones at home open , " he said .
" protectionism is an american problem . " the european commission deemed the french auto package on saturday to be free of protectionism , but fears of governments deciding to bail out their industries at the expense of others were not diminished . " always we must resist the temptation of protectionism , " polish prime minister donald tusk told journalists after meeting of leaders from nine eastern european countries that took place ahead of the major summit . sms / afp / dpa / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de new eu members should be treated equally , says polish minister european union veterans should treat newly-entered members from central and eastern europe as equals , and give them the same chance to join the euro as old members , poland 's minister for europe said on sunday .
-lrb- 01.03.2009 -rrb- unity at stake as eu summit begins under protectionism cloud eu leaders gathered in brussels on sunday for a summit designed to shore up the bloc 's beleaguered unity in the midst of a damaging row over protectionism and fears that the eu may risk breaking into splinter groups .

just hours before polls opened , basque police arrested a suspected eta member they believe was planning a bomb attack timed to coincide with the vote .
a total of around four million people are eligible to vote to elect regional parliaments in what are the first elections since the socialist party of prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero was returned to power one year ago .
since then , the global financial crisis has accelerated the collapse of spain 's property market after a decade-long boom , pushing the country into recession .
the unemployment rate soared to 13.9 percent in the last quarter of 2008 , the highest in the 27-nation european union .
in sunday 's polls , zapatero will be seeking to measure the degree of support he has to handle the crisis .
opinion polls indicate the socialists could end the 30-year hold on power by the basque nationalist party in the northern basque region .
historic socialist victory a possibility a socialist victory in the wealthy semi-autonomous region would mark the first time since the country returned to democracy in 1975 that the basque country is governed by a party that unquestionably backs keeping it as part of spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's socialists want the basques to remain spanish analysts credit the rise in support for the socialists in part to zapatero 's bid during his first term to negotiate peace with eta , blamed for 825 deaths in its 40-year campaign for an independent basque homeland .
those negotiations eventually failed and the group resumed its attacks .
spain 's supreme court last month banned two pro-independence parties from participating in sunday 's election due to their links to eta and its outlawed political wing batasuna .
eta responded to the court decision by staging its first attack in the spanish capital since december 2006 , setting off a van packed with explosives in a business district , causing extensive damage but no injuries .
late last month week , another eta bomb exploded outside the headquarters of the basque socialist party in the town of lazkao , causing major damage but no injuries .
the bombings raised fears that the regional election could be marred by further eta attacks .
the basque interior ministry said it is deploying 5,000 police throughout the region sunday , or more than half of its entire force of 8,000 .

the election results could also determine the future of pp leader mariano rajoy , who has struggled with party infighting following two successive national election defeats .
rajoy has campaigned hard in his home region of galicia , but the party has been hit by allegations of corruption in madrid and several other regions involving businessmen close to the pp .

just hours before polls opened , basque police arrested a suspected eta member they believe was planning a bomb attack timed to coincide with the vote .
a total of around four million people are eligible to vote to elect regional parliaments in what are the first elections since the socialist party of prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero was returned to power one year ago .
since then , the global financial crisis has accelerated the collapse of spain 's property market after a decade-long boom , pushing the country into recession .
the unemployment rate soared to 13.9 percent in the last quarter of 2008 , the highest in the 27-nation european union .
in sunday 's polls , zapatero will be seeking to measure the degree of support he has to handle the crisis .
opinion polls indicate the socialists could end the 30-year hold on power by the basque nationalist party in the northern basque region .
historic socialist victory a possibility a socialist victory in the wealthy semi-autonomous region would mark the first time since the country returned to democracy in 1975 that the basque country is governed by a party that unquestionably backs keeping it as part of spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's socialists want the basques to remain spanish analysts credit the rise in support for the socialists in part to zapatero 's bid during his first term to negotiate peace with eta , blamed for 825 deaths in its 40-year campaign for an independent basque homeland .
those negotiations eventually failed and the group resumed its attacks .
spain 's supreme court last month banned two pro-independence parties from participating in sunday 's election due to their links to eta and its outlawed political wing batasuna .
eta responded to the court decision by staging its first attack in the spanish capital since december 2006 , setting off a van packed with explosives in a business district , causing extensive damage but no injuries .
late last month week , another eta bomb exploded outside the headquarters of the basque socialist party in the town of lazkao , causing major damage but no injuries .
the bombings raised fears that the regional election could be marred by further eta attacks .
the basque interior ministry said it is deploying 5,000 police throughout the region sunday , or more than half of its entire force of 8,000 .

the election results could also determine the future of pp leader mariano rajoy , who has struggled with party infighting following two successive national election defeats .
rajoy has campaigned hard in his home region of galicia , but the party has been hit by allegations of corruption in madrid and several other regions involving businessmen close to the pp .
polling stations opened in the two regions at 09:00 cet and close at 20:00 cet , when local television stations are expected to release the results of exit polls .

moscow has reacted furiously to plans by the former administration of george w. bush to place missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic , saying the move was directly aimed against russia .

" we expect rapid international aid from all parties to completely rebuild gaza , " palestinian president mahmud abbas told reporters on saturday , feb .
28 . " we also expect that as in the past there will be one mechanism , the palestinian authority , " he said after meeting eu foreign policy chief javier solana in the west bank town of ramallah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has said it 's willing to work with abbas hamas has been boycotted by the major western donors , who consider it a terrorist organization and who deal exclusively with abbas ' moderate palestinian authority . the palestinian authority and hamas each want to lead the rebuilding effort , but western countries have said they will work only with abbas . " i would like to insist that the mechanism used to deploy the money is the one that represents the palestinian authority , " solana said .
" i do n't think there is a need for new mechanisms . " star delegate at the aid conference in the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh will us secretary of state hillary clinton , who will reportedly arrive bearing a check for $ 900 million -lrb- 710 million euros -rrb- . saudi arabia is expected to reaffirm a commitment to provide $ 1 billion towards reconstruction , and the european union has said it will grant $ 554 million to the palestinian people in 2009 . donor countries from the january 2008 paris conference will reiterate a pledge of $ 7.4 billion in aid to the palestinians in the three years 2008-2010 , of which $ 3 billion has so far been distributed . palestinian prime minister salam fayyad has said he is seeking $ 2.8 billion to rebuild gaza . around 75 delegations are scheduled to attend monday 's conference , which is organized by egypt and norway and sponsored by the united nations , european union , france , italy and the arab league . the 1.4-million population of the gaza strip - around half of whom depend on united nations handouts - are in dire need of help from the international community . gaza suffering under hamas-targeted measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since hamas took control of gaza , the situation has worsened the gaza economy was brought to its knees by the blockade imposed by israel from the time hamas seized control of the enclave . then israel 's 22-day onslaught on the territory in december and january caused physical devastation , destroying homes , hospitals , schools and other infrastructure as well as killing more than 1,300 palestinians . fayyad says the damage to homes has forced 90,000 people to live in tents now pitched amid the ruins . neither israel nor hamas will be represented at the gathering , but for the aid program to succeed israel must lift its blockade and hamas will have to be reconciled with the secular fatah , backbone of the palestinian authority . the rival palestinian factions have agreed to start talks aimed at working towards the formation of a " consensus " government . israeli prime minister ehud olmert has said his priority is the release of soldier gilad shalit from captivity by hamas , placing this aim above reaching a lasting truce in gaza or negotiating to lift the blockade . but egypt is continuing discussions aimed at trying to broker a long-term truce , and the middle east peace quartet will meet on the sidelines of the aid conference to discuss how to revive the peace process . clinton is expected to attend that event , as is solana , un head ban ki-moon and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said the aid conference has a double role : economic , to organize humanitarian aid and the reconstruction of gaza , and political , focused on the peace process . " the mechanism for the reconstruction will be fixed at sharm el-sheikh , " he said , but whatever is agreed can not be implemented until israel agrees to end its blockade and open border crossings into and out of gaza . high political price for hamas and israel rebuilding war-shattered gaza also carries a high political price for both israel and hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and fatah will have to cooperate to rebuild gaza hamas may need to come to terms with a return of the palestinian authority while israel could face growing pressure to reopen border crossings into gaza that have been closed since the hamas takeover to all but vital goods .
the israeli blockade was imposed in response to militant rocket and mortar fire . the blockade would have to be at least significantly eased to allow in the materials needed to rebuild the overcrowded coastal strip . and with such huge sums at stake , donors are bound to want results , not only in the daunting task of actually rebuilding gaza but also in the search for a solution to the seemingly intractable israeli-palestinian conflict . this could be particularly challenging at a time when israel 's hawkish likud leader benjamin netanyahu appears set to form a right-wing coalition government opposed to any significant concession to the palestinians . " for reconstruction to work , a new environment has to be established , " said palestinian planning minister samir abdallah .
" there has to be a climate of stability and security through a truce , but also a palestinian government that is trustworthy , " he said . hamas and abbas 's fatah faction agreed in egyptian-sponsored talks on thursday to work together towards setting up a unity government that will supervise gaza 's reconstruction . eu : donor conference an opportunity for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes the conference will provide a platform for debate solana said during a middle east tour ahead of the conference that the gathering would also be an opportunity to " create a political dynamic " in the israeli-palestinian talks . " donors ' money is political money , " said mohammed shtayyeh , who heads the palestinian economic council for development and reconstruction -lrb- pecdar -rrb- tasked by the palestinian authority to supervise donor-financed projects .
" donors also come to support the peace process , and this will emerge from sharm el-sheikh . " shtayyeh said that pecdar has 56 architects and engineers in gaza and was " ready to carry out any project it is given . " he insisted , however , that reconstruction would not be possible unless the blockade is lifted . " today one ca n't find a single bag of cement or steel bar in gaza , " he said . the international committee for the red cross stressed that efforts to rebuild gaza can only succeed if they are accompanied by credible political steps to resolve the crisis . " the first and most urgent measure should be to end the isolation of gaza , particularly by lifting restrictions on the movement of people and goods , " said icrc president jakob kellenberger . nda / sms / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we expect rapid international aid from all parties to completely rebuild gaza , " palestinian president mahmud abbas told reporters on saturday , feb .

" we also expect that as in the past there will be one mechanism , the palestinian authority , " he said after meeting eu foreign policy chief javier solana in the west bank town of ramallah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has said it 's willing to work with abbas hamas has been boycotted by the major western donors , who consider it a terrorist organization and who deal exclusively with abbas ' moderate palestinian authority . the palestinian authority and hamas each want to lead the rebuilding effort , but western countries have said they will work only with abbas . " i would like to insist that the mechanism used to deploy the money is the one that represents the palestinian authority , " solana said .
" i do n't think there is a need for new mechanisms . " star delegate at the aid conference in the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh will us secretary of state hillary clinton , who will reportedly arrive bearing a check for $ 900 million -lrb- 710 million euros -rrb- . saudi arabia is expected to reaffirm a commitment to provide $ 1 billion towards reconstruction , and the european union has said it will grant $ 554 million to the palestinian people in 2009 . donor countries from the january 2008 paris conference will reiterate a pledge of $ 7.4 billion in aid to the palestinians in the three years 2008-2010 , of which $ 3 billion has so far been distributed . palestinian prime minister salam fayyad has said he is seeking $ 2.8 billion to rebuild gaza . around 75 delegations are scheduled to attend monday 's conference , which is organized by egypt and norway and sponsored by the united nations , european union , france , italy and the arab league . the 1.4-million population of the gaza strip - around half of whom depend on united nations handouts - are in dire need of help from the international community . gaza suffering under hamas-targeted measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since hamas took control of gaza , the situation has worsened the gaza economy was brought to its knees by the blockade imposed by israel from the time hamas seized control of the enclave . then israel 's 22-day onslaught on the territory in december and january caused physical devastation , destroying homes , hospitals , schools and other infrastructure as well as killing more than 1,300 palestinians . fayyad says the damage to homes has forced 90,000 people to live in tents now pitched amid the ruins . neither israel nor hamas will be represented at the gathering , but for the aid program to succeed israel must lift its blockade and hamas will have to be reconciled with the secular fatah , backbone of the palestinian authority . the rival palestinian factions have agreed to start talks aimed at working towards the formation of a " consensus " government . israeli prime minister ehud olmert has said his priority is the release of soldier gilad shalit from captivity by hamas , placing this aim above reaching a lasting truce in gaza or negotiating to lift the blockade . but egypt is continuing discussions aimed at trying to broker a long-term truce , and the middle east peace quartet will meet on the sidelines of the aid conference to discuss how to revive the peace process . clinton is expected to attend that event , as is solana , un head ban ki-moon and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said the aid conference has a double role : economic , to organize humanitarian aid and the reconstruction of gaza , and political , focused on the peace process . " the mechanism for the reconstruction will be fixed at sharm el-sheikh , " he said , but whatever is agreed can not be implemented until israel agrees to end its blockade and open border crossings into and out of gaza . high political price for hamas and israel rebuilding war-shattered gaza also carries a high political price for both israel and hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and fatah will have to cooperate to rebuild gaza hamas may need to come to terms with a return of the palestinian authority while israel could face growing pressure to reopen border crossings into gaza that have been closed since the hamas takeover to all but vital goods .
the israeli blockade was imposed in response to militant rocket and mortar fire . the blockade would have to be at least significantly eased to allow in the materials needed to rebuild the overcrowded coastal strip . and with such huge sums at stake , donors are bound to want results , not only in the daunting task of actually rebuilding gaza but also in the search for a solution to the seemingly intractable israeli-palestinian conflict . this could be particularly challenging at a time when israel 's hawkish likud leader benjamin netanyahu appears set to form a right-wing coalition government opposed to any significant concession to the palestinians . " for reconstruction to work , a new environment has to be established , " said palestinian planning minister samir abdallah .
" there has to be a climate of stability and security through a truce , but also a palestinian government that is trustworthy , " he said . hamas and abbas 's fatah faction agreed in egyptian-sponsored talks on thursday to work together towards setting up a unity government that will supervise gaza 's reconstruction . eu : donor conference an opportunity for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes the conference will provide a platform for debate solana said during a middle east tour ahead of the conference that the gathering would also be an opportunity to " create a political dynamic " in the israeli-palestinian talks . " donors ' money is political money , " said mohammed shtayyeh , who heads the palestinian economic council for development and reconstruction -lrb- pecdar -rrb- tasked by the palestinian authority to supervise donor-financed projects .
" donors also come to support the peace process , and this will emerge from sharm el-sheikh . " shtayyeh said that pecdar has 56 architects and engineers in gaza and was " ready to carry out any project it is given . " he insisted , however , that reconstruction would not be possible unless the blockade is lifted . " today one ca n't find a single bag of cement or steel bar in gaza , " he said . the international committee for the red cross stressed that efforts to rebuild gaza can only succeed if they are accompanied by credible political steps to resolve the crisis .

" we suggest that bosnia be transformed into a federation in which the federal units shall have the right to self-determination , " bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik said .
" why should n't we go the way of czechoslovakia , and meet up in the european union , " he said saturday in an interview with a croatian daily , after several days of stern statements on the failure of bosnia .
in what became known as the " velvet divorce , " czechoslovakia dismembered in 1993 to form the czech republic and slovakia .
the two new states joined the eu nine years later .
dodik said the " federal units " of bosnia should be able to resort to self-determination after " five to 10 years . "
the dayton peace agreement ended bosnia 's 1992-1995 war and left the former yugoslav republic divided into two entities , the serb-run republika srpska and muslim-croat federation .
under the terms of the accord , each region has its own government , parliament and police , but neither is allowed to secede .
the latest political crisis erupted last month after it was reported that dodik and other bosnian serb politicians were the subject of a corruption probe .
justice authorities have yet to confirm the existence of a case against dodik , but bosnian serb leaders unanimously condemned what they called " illegal procedures " against their entity .
they have even threatened to leave central institutions , which would cause them to be blocked as the representatives of all three of bosnia 's main ethnic groups - muslims , croats , and serbs - must be present for them to function .
bosnian serb pm threatens split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik says that any split would be permanent " if we walk out , we will never come back , " dodik said in comments published in sarajevo 's dnevni avaz on friday .
he denounced as " farcical " the investigation that has been launched against him , adding : " i lost the little confidence i had in the bosnian state . "
observers say the developments illustrate the fragility of bosnia .
" whenever we are faced with political tensions , bosnia is confronted by the risk of collapsing and its existence is questioned , " political analyst tanja topic told reporters .
for srecko latal , another political commentator , bosnia 's two entities were like the two engines of a hybrid vehicle , which meant the balkan country was " always broken down . "
the crisis emerged as the leaders of the main political parties representing muslims , croats and serbs , including dodik , were engaged in talks aimed at finding common ground for eu-backed constitutional reforms .
" this crisis has long blocked the constitutional reform , " said topic .
the former yugoslav states of serbia and croatia , both involved in bosnia 's war and among the guarantors of the dayton peace agreement , are also involved in this crisis .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson does not believe that the holocaust took place " if he 's silent , if he stays out of sight , that would really be better for everyone , " fellay said in the interview to appear on monday .
" i hope that he drops out of public life for a long while . "
williamson would be excluded from the community " if he starts again to deny the holocaust , " he added .
" he has hurt us and damaged our reputation .
we are definitely distancing ourselves from him , " fellay said .
in a letter to the vatican released thursday , williamson apologized for his recent comments about the holocaust - but did not say whether he 's changed his views or that his comments had been erroneous .
a step in the right direction ?
the vatican turned down the apology .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said on friday that williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set forth by the vatican under which the bishop was to " distance himself unequivocally and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wanted to be admitted as a prelate in the church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson ran an sspx seminary in la reja , argentina fellay , however , considered the letter a " major step in the right direction " and that , in his view , it was unlikely that the vatican would excommunicate williamson again .
in berlin , the president of germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knobloch said on friday she was " appalled " by williamson 's latest remarks , while the council 's secretary general , stephan kramer , said that the cleric 's apology was " completely irrelevant . " " he is sorry about the pain , but has taken back nothing of substance , " kramer said .
" i believe the apology is a diversion tactic to get rid of the pressure and the limelight , " allowing the brotherhood to continue preaching their " antidemocratic , unconstitutional , misogynist , antisemitic values . "
back in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being ousted by argentina , williamson returned to england the argentine government asked the bishop to leave the south american country - where he ran an sspx seminary 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires - because his remarks on the holocaust were seen as " deeply offensive to argentine society , the jewish people and humanity . "
williamson returned to britain where he is believed to be staying with fellow priests at the offices of the society of saint pius x in the leafy southwest london suburb of wimbledon .
fellay and williamson were among four excommunicated bishops that pope benedict xvi rehabilitated last month in an attempt to heal a decades-old split with traditionalists who did not accept the reforms of the second vatican council of the early 1960s .
the vatican has said pope benedict had n't been aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he revoked his excommunication .
williamson , 68 , told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
he also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million . tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

williamson would be excluded from the community " if he starts again to deny the holocaust , " he added .
" he has hurt us and damaged our reputation .

in a letter to the vatican released thursday , williamson apologized for his recent comments about the holocaust - but did not say whether he 's changed his views or that his comments had been erroneous .
a step in the right direction ?
the vatican turned down the apology .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said on friday that williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set forth by the vatican under which the bishop was to " distance himself unequivocally and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wanted to be admitted as a prelate in the church .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 01.03.2009 hariri tribunal starts work in netherlands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hariri was killed in a bomb explosion on feb .
14 , 2005 the international tribunal to try suspects in the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri four years ago was formally constituted in the hague on sunday , march 1 . constituted under a united nations mandate , the court is to examine a number of issues , including allegations that syria was behind the killing of hariri in a massive beirut bomb blast on feb .
14 , 2005 . syria has repeatedly denied allegations of involvement in the hariri attack , in which 22 other people were also killed . court registrar robin vincent told the opening that the tribunal was in the first place not so much for the united nations or for the international community as " for lebanon . " a group of several dozen lebanese outside the heavily-fortified tribunal building - a former dutch secret service gym in the hague suburb of leidschendam-voorburg - waved national flags . historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saad hariri called march 1 a historic day of justice hariri 's son saad called the opening of the court a historic day for his country . " today the flag of justice for lebanon is being raised in the hague ; he said in a statement issued in beirut .
" march 1 is the fruit of the efforts of all lebanese people who supported the establishment of the court and who refused to yield to threats and terror . " four lebanese generals regarded as pro-syrian are expected to be charged by the hague court in connection with the murder .
a lebanese investigating judge friday rejected a request for their release . the four - mustafa hamdan , commander of the presidential guard , jamil sayyed , director of security services , domestic security head ali hajj , and the commander of army intelligence raymond azar - have been detained in lebanon since 2005 . canadian daniel bellemare assumed the role of the tribunal 's chief prosecutor .
the 56-year-old had been the head un investigator in the case since november 2007 . trial likely to last years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will likely take years for the people of lebaon to know how hariri was killed bellemere pledged to do all in his power to get to the bottom of the assassination , and had already made clear before sunday 's formal opening of the tribunal that he would seek the transfer of the four generals from lebanon . the four have not been formally charged .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 01.03.2009 conservative bishop wants holocaust denier out of spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the society of st. pius x is aware of the damage caused by williamson 's views the head of the ultra-conservative catholic community that bishop richard williamson is a member of said the holocaust-denying clergyman should stop making public statements which have damaged the order 's reputation . in an interview with the german weekly der spiegel , bernard fellay , head of the saint pius x society -lrb- sspx -rrb- , reacted to the uproar over comments williamson made that no jews died in nazi gas chambers during world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson does not believe that the holocaust took place " if he 's silent , if he stays out of sight , that would really be better for everyone , " fellay said in the interview to appear on monday .
" i hope that he drops out of public life for a long while . "
williamson would be excluded from the community " if he starts again to deny the holocaust , " he added .
" he has hurt us and damaged our reputation .
we are definitely distancing ourselves from him , " fellay said .
in a letter to the vatican released thursday , williamson apologized for his recent comments about the holocaust - but did not say whether he 's changed his views or that his comments had been erroneous .
a step in the right direction ?
the vatican turned down the apology .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said on friday that williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set forth by the vatican under which the bishop was to " distance himself unequivocally and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wanted to be admitted as a prelate in the church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson ran an sspx seminary in la reja , argentina fellay , however , considered the letter a " major step in the right direction " and that , in his view , it was unlikely that the vatican would excommunicate williamson again .
in berlin , the president of germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knobloch said on friday she was " appalled " by williamson 's latest remarks , while the council 's secretary general , stephan kramer , said that the cleric 's apology was " completely irrelevant . " " he is sorry about the pain , but has taken back nothing of substance , " kramer said .
" i believe the apology is a diversion tactic to get rid of the pressure and the limelight , " allowing the brotherhood to continue preaching their " antidemocratic , unconstitutional , misogynist , antisemitic values . "
back in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being ousted by argentina , williamson returned to england the argentine government asked the bishop to leave the south american country - where he ran an sspx seminary 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires - because his remarks on the holocaust were seen as " deeply offensive to argentine society , the jewish people and humanity . "
williamson returned to britain where he is believed to be staying with fellow priests at the offices of the society of saint pius x in the leafy southwest london suburb of wimbledon .
fellay and williamson were among four excommunicated bishops that pope benedict xvi rehabilitated last month in an attempt to heal a decades-old split with traditionalists who did not accept the reforms of the second vatican council of the early 1960s .
the vatican has said pope benedict had n't been aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he revoked his excommunication .
williamson , 68 , told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
he also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million . tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a networked society needs to stay online in every room and out on the road . the nifty little netbooks which have been selling like hot cakes since making a splash at the last cebit are the devices that live this dream : permanently connected to the internet via embedded umts , the fastest mobile-phone signal currently available . " they are also ultra-lightweight and have long battery life , " explained a salesman for asus , the taiwanese manufacturer which scored a big success last year with its simple little eee range . a netbook 's battery life should be long enough for " all-day computing , " defined by asus as an eight-hour day without a recharge . baby boomers like their tvs while these tiny computers grab all the attention , vendors have never completely given up on the idea that older internet users might prefer to surf the web using enormous flat-panel televisions . a key reason for this is the discovery that middle-aged people retain an almost obsessive affinity with their tv sets .
oddly , neither the old nor young people are quite as tv-centered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california will be the first state to be the official partner of the cebit trade fair klaus boehm of the us-based consultancy firm deloitte quotes from a recent international survey by his company .
pollsters discovered for example 75 percent of german baby boomers -lrb- the 44-60 age group -rrb- thought the tv , not the computer , was the most important device in their homes for hearing about the world outside . the survey , " the state of media democracy , " was conducted in five nations including the united states , japan and brazil . curiously , both mature people -lrb- over 60 -rrb- and the young put a higher value on computers as the best way to stay informed . as if to meet the needs of boomers , asus has announced the eee keyboard , a wireless computer that uses a tv screen , due for release at the end of this year 's second quarter . the product , first disclosed at the consumer electronics show -lrb- ces -rrb- this january in las vegas , has only a tiny 5-inch status display and is mainly a keyboard .
entertainment and web pages must be viewed on a television , connected to the device by wireless . exhibitor numbers plummet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california governor arnold schwarzenegger will open the cebit the number of exhibitors at the world 's biggest high-tech fair will be off by more than a quarter due to the impact of the global economic slump . some 4,300 firms from 69 countries will be displaying their latest gadgets , down from 5,845 companies last year , the fair 's host deutsche messe said in a statement . " given the depth of the world economic crisis , this number represents a success , " deutsche messe board member ernst raue said . he said some companies were returning after a long absence from the event in the northern city of hanover , including nokia siemens networks and e-commerce specialist intershop .
another 200 exhibitors are attending for the first time . this year 's cebit features california , the place where personal computing began , as special partner .

" eu leaders were also to use the summit to hammer out a common position to take to a meeting of leaders from the 20 biggest economic powers in london on april 2 .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek said sunday that eu leaders would meet with us president barack obama in prague three days after the g20 meeting . sharing the burden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmaker opel is among those looking for help upon his arrival in brussels , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said , " we should not be taking jobs from each other . " the main split in the union is between rich countries , which want strong action to support industry - particularly carmakers , and poorer nations - largely located in eastern and central europe , who can not afford massive industry bail-outs . eastern european nations have also been especially hard hit by the crisis .
hungary 's prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said the time had come for richer eu members to show their solidarity with poorer countries . " we should not allow a new iron curtain to be set up and divide europe in two parts , " he warned , proposing a fund worth up to 190 billion euros -lrb- $ 240 billion -rrb- . his proposal is substantially more than the 24.5 billion euros in aid that international institutions agreed on friday to make available to eastern european countries to help them cope with the crisis .
eastern and central european economies are often dependent on credit from western sources , which has become nearly impossible to receive . no special treatment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said international aid should be looked at on a case-by-case basis but there was little sympathy for the hungarian proposal .
the european union 's current czech presidency ruled out special treatment for the region . " i do n't believe that it is necessary now to separate several countries in the european union , " the czech republic 's topolanek told journalists as he arrived to chair the emergency eu summit , adding that such aid would be offered to any eu member , not only eastern european countries . " i think that it was perfectly clear that the european union is n't going to leave anybody in the lurch , " topolanek told journalists after the meeting . as the leader of the 27-member bloc 's largest economy , german chancellor angela merkel said her country was in favor of helping european countries on a case to case basis but she has not detailed how aid would be provided .
berlin has resisted calls for a euro-zone bond to raise money for suffering countries in the shared currency zone . merkel , who arrived late to the summit due to technical difficulties with her government plane , said the bloc could not afford to lump countries together solely according to their geographic location .
she said " the situation is very different " from one eastern european nation to another , and warned of starting a debate including " massive figures " of support for the region . auto industry protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's plan to help french carmakers has some worried many eastern european countries are also growing increasingly concerned about the possible return of protectionism .
french president nicolas sarkozy made aid to its car sector conditional on companies not moving production to the region and said french carmakers should work to preserve jobs in france .
on sunday , he denied the move was rooted in protectionism . " we did n't ask to close factories in other countries , but to keep ones at home open , " he said .
" protectionism is an american problem . " the european commission deemed the french auto package on saturday to be free of protectionism , but fears of governments deciding to bail out their industries at the expense of others were not diminished . " always we must resist the temptation of protectionism , " polish prime minister donald tusk told journalists after meeting of leaders from nine eastern european countries that took place ahead of the major summit . sms / afp / dpa / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow has reacted furiously to plans by the former administration of george w. bush to place missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic , saying the move was directly aimed against russia .
" i am counting on the new us administration behaving on this question in a more creative and friendly way , " medvedev said in an interview with spanish media , the transcript of which was published on the kremlin website .
" we have already received positive signals from our american colleagues .
i am expecting that these signals will turn into concrete proposals , " he added .
medvedev said he hoped that this issue would be discussed in his first meeting with obama , expected to take place on the sidelines of the meeting of g20 countries in london on april 2 .
the russian president had warned last year russia would deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian enclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .
the bush administration said its plans to build a radar base in the czech republic and install interceptor missiles in poland were not directed against russia but aimed at countering missile threats from states such as iran .
" russia does not like this , that is absolutely clear , " said medvedev .
medvedev urges us to face threats with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said bush was immovable on the missile shield he said it was undeniable that there were threats to international security in the world .
" but let us react to these threats together , without isolating each other from these processes . "
medvedev complained that the bush administration 's attitude had been " very simple : ' we are doing this because we have decided it that way . " '
russian officials have repeatedly expressed optimism for the prospects for ties under obama , although the new us president has yet to give much detail on his plans for russia policies .
however a pattern could emerge in the near future , with us secretary of state hillary clinton due to have her first face-to-face meeting with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov next week .
russia 's war in georgia in august over the breakaway region of south ossetia sent relations between russia and the west plummeting to lows not seen since the collapse of the soviet union .
us vice president joe biden declared at a security conference last month it was time to " press the reset button " in relations and " revisit the many areas where we can and should work together .

" we suggest that bosnia be transformed into a federation in which the federal units shall have the right to self-determination , " bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik said .
" why should n't we go the way of czechoslovakia , and meet up in the european union , " he said saturday in an interview with a croatian daily , after several days of stern statements on the failure of bosnia .
in what became known as the " velvet divorce , " czechoslovakia dismembered in 1993 to form the czech republic and slovakia .
the two new states joined the eu nine years later .
dodik said the " federal units " of bosnia should be able to resort to self-determination after " five to 10 years . "
the dayton peace agreement ended bosnia 's 1992-1995 war and left the former yugoslav republic divided into two entities , the serb-run republika srpska and muslim-croat federation .
under the terms of the accord , each region has its own government , parliament and police , but neither is allowed to secede .
the latest political crisis erupted last month after it was reported that dodik and other bosnian serb politicians were the subject of a corruption probe .
justice authorities have yet to confirm the existence of a case against dodik , but bosnian serb leaders unanimously condemned what they called " illegal procedures " against their entity .
they have even threatened to leave central institutions , which would cause them to be blocked as the representatives of all three of bosnia 's main ethnic groups - muslims , croats , and serbs - must be present for them to function .
bosnian serb pm threatens split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik says that any split would be permanent " if we walk out , we will never come back , " dodik said in comments published in sarajevo 's dnevni avaz on friday .
he denounced as " farcical " the investigation that has been launched against him , adding : " i lost the little confidence i had in the bosnian state . "
observers say the developments illustrate the fragility of bosnia .
" whenever we are faced with political tensions , bosnia is confronted by the risk of collapsing and its existence is questioned , " political analyst tanja topic told reporters .
for srecko latal , another political commentator , bosnia 's two entities were like the two engines of a hybrid vehicle , which meant the balkan country was " always broken down . "
the crisis emerged as the leaders of the main political parties representing muslims , croats and serbs , including dodik , were engaged in talks aimed at finding common ground for eu-backed constitutional reforms .
" this crisis has long blocked the constitutional reform , " said topic .
the former yugoslav states of serbia and croatia , both involved in bosnia 's war and among the guarantors of the dayton peace agreement , are also involved in this crisis .
serbia offers dodik support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic gave his support to dodik serbian president boris tadic strongly denounced what he said was a campaign to undermine the " personal and professional integrity " of dodik , in a statement issued this week .
meanwhile , croatian president stipe mesic said saturday he was firmly opposed to any division of bosnia .

a networked society needs to stay online in every room and out on the road . the nifty little netbooks which have been selling like hot cakes since making a splash at the last cebit are the devices that live this dream : permanently connected to the internet via embedded umts , the fastest mobile-phone signal currently available . " they are also ultra-lightweight and have long battery life , " explained a salesman for asus , the taiwanese manufacturer which scored a big success last year with its simple little eee range . a netbook 's battery life should be long enough for " all-day computing , " defined by asus as an eight-hour day without a recharge . baby boomers like their tvs while these tiny computers grab all the attention , vendors have never completely given up on the idea that older internet users might prefer to surf the web using enormous flat-panel televisions . a key reason for this is the discovery that middle-aged people retain an almost obsessive affinity with their tv sets .

" star delegate at the aid conference in the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh will us secretary of state hillary clinton , who will reportedly arrive bearing a check for $ 900 million -lrb- 710 million euros -rrb- . saudi arabia is expected to reaffirm a commitment to provide $ 1 billion towards reconstruction , and the european union has said it will grant $ 554 million to the palestinian people in 2009 . donor countries from the january 2008 paris conference will reiterate a pledge of $ 7.4 billion in aid to the palestinians in the three years 2008-2010 , of which $ 3 billion has so far been distributed . palestinian prime minister salam fayyad has said he is seeking $ 2.8 billion to rebuild gaza . around 75 delegations are scheduled to attend monday 's conference , which is organized by egypt and norway and sponsored by the united nations , european union , france , italy and the arab league . the 1.4-million population of the gaza strip - around half of whom depend on united nations handouts - are in dire need of help from the international community . gaza suffering under hamas-targeted measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since hamas took control of gaza , the situation has worsened the gaza economy was brought to its knees by the blockade imposed by israel from the time hamas seized control of the enclave . then israel 's 22-day onslaught on the territory in december and january caused physical devastation , destroying homes , hospitals , schools and other infrastructure as well as killing more than 1,300 palestinians . fayyad says the damage to homes has forced 90,000 people to live in tents now pitched amid the ruins . neither israel nor hamas will be represented at the gathering , but for the aid program to succeed israel must lift its blockade and hamas will have to be reconciled with the secular fatah , backbone of the palestinian authority . the rival palestinian factions have agreed to start talks aimed at working towards the formation of a " consensus " government . israeli prime minister ehud olmert has said his priority is the release of soldier gilad shalit from captivity by hamas , placing this aim above reaching a lasting truce in gaza or negotiating to lift the blockade . but egypt is continuing discussions aimed at trying to broker a long-term truce , and the middle east peace quartet will meet on the sidelines of the aid conference to discuss how to revive the peace process . clinton is expected to attend that event , as is solana , un head ban ki-moon and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said the aid conference has a double role : economic , to organize humanitarian aid and the reconstruction of gaza , and political , focused on the peace process . " the mechanism for the reconstruction will be fixed at sharm el-sheikh , " he said , but whatever is agreed can not be implemented until israel agrees to end its blockade and open border crossings into and out of gaza . high political price for hamas and israel rebuilding war-shattered gaza also carries a high political price for both israel and hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and fatah will have to cooperate to rebuild gaza hamas may need to come to terms with a return of the palestinian authority while israel could face growing pressure to reopen border crossings into gaza that have been closed since the hamas takeover to all but vital goods .
the israeli blockade was imposed in response to militant rocket and mortar fire . the blockade would have to be at least significantly eased to allow in the materials needed to rebuild the overcrowded coastal strip . and with such huge sums at stake , donors are bound to want results , not only in the daunting task of actually rebuilding gaza but also in the search for a solution to the seemingly intractable israeli-palestinian conflict . this could be particularly challenging at a time when israel 's hawkish likud leader benjamin netanyahu appears set to form a right-wing coalition government opposed to any significant concession to the palestinians . " for reconstruction to work , a new environment has to be established , " said palestinian planning minister samir abdallah .
" there has to be a climate of stability and security through a truce , but also a palestinian government that is trustworthy , " he said . hamas and abbas 's fatah faction agreed in egyptian-sponsored talks on thursday to work together towards setting up a unity government that will supervise gaza 's reconstruction . eu : donor conference an opportunity for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes the conference will provide a platform for debate solana said during a middle east tour ahead of the conference that the gathering would also be an opportunity to " create a political dynamic " in the israeli-palestinian talks . " donors ' money is political money , " said mohammed shtayyeh , who heads the palestinian economic council for development and reconstruction -lrb- pecdar -rrb- tasked by the palestinian authority to supervise donor-financed projects .
" donors also come to support the peace process , and this will emerge from sharm el-sheikh . " shtayyeh said that pecdar has 56 architects and engineers in gaza and was " ready to carry out any project it is given . " he insisted , however , that reconstruction would not be possible unless the blockade is lifted . " today one ca n't find a single bag of cement or steel bar in gaza , " he said . the international committee for the red cross stressed that efforts to rebuild gaza can only succeed if they are accompanied by credible political steps to resolve the crisis . " the first and most urgent measure should be to end the isolation of gaza , particularly by lifting restrictions on the movement of people and goods , " said icrc president jakob kellenberger . nda / sms / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" why should n't we go the way of czechoslovakia , and meet up in the european union , " he said saturday in an interview with a croatian daily , after several days of stern statements on the failure of bosnia .
in what became known as the " velvet divorce , " czechoslovakia dismembered in 1993 to form the czech republic and slovakia .
the two new states joined the eu nine years later .
dodik said the " federal units " of bosnia should be able to resort to self-determination after " five to 10 years . "
the dayton peace agreement ended bosnia 's 1992-1995 war and left the former yugoslav republic divided into two entities , the serb-run republika srpska and muslim-croat federation .

the latest political crisis erupted last month after it was reported that dodik and other bosnian serb politicians were the subject of a corruption probe .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson does not believe that the holocaust took place " if he 's silent , if he stays out of sight , that would really be better for everyone , " fellay said in the interview to appear on monday .
" i hope that he drops out of public life for a long while . "
williamson would be excluded from the community " if he starts again to deny the holocaust , " he added .
" he has hurt us and damaged our reputation .
we are definitely distancing ourselves from him , " fellay said .
in a letter to the vatican released thursday , williamson apologized for his recent comments about the holocaust - but did not say whether he 's changed his views or that his comments had been erroneous .
a step in the right direction ?
the vatican turned down the apology .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said on friday that williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set forth by the vatican under which the bishop was to " distance himself unequivocally and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wanted to be admitted as a prelate in the church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson ran an sspx seminary in la reja , argentina fellay , however , considered the letter a " major step in the right direction " and that , in his view , it was unlikely that the vatican would excommunicate williamson again .
in berlin , the president of germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knobloch said on friday she was " appalled " by williamson 's latest remarks , while the council 's secretary general , stephan kramer , said that the cleric 's apology was " completely irrelevant . " " he is sorry about the pain , but has taken back nothing of substance , " kramer said .
" i believe the apology is a diversion tactic to get rid of the pressure and the limelight , " allowing the brotherhood to continue preaching their " antidemocratic , unconstitutional , misogynist , antisemitic values . "
back in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being ousted by argentina , williamson returned to england the argentine government asked the bishop to leave the south american country - where he ran an sspx seminary 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires - because his remarks on the holocaust were seen as " deeply offensive to argentine society , the jewish people and humanity . "
williamson returned to britain where he is believed to be staying with fellow priests at the offices of the society of saint pius x in the leafy southwest london suburb of wimbledon .
fellay and williamson were among four excommunicated bishops that pope benedict xvi rehabilitated last month in an attempt to heal a decades-old split with traditionalists who did not accept the reforms of the second vatican council of the early 1960s .
the vatican has said pope benedict had n't been aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he revoked his excommunication .
williamson , 68 , told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
he also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million . tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we suggest that bosnia be transformed into a federation in which the federal units shall have the right to self-determination , " bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik said .
" why should n't we go the way of czechoslovakia , and meet up in the european union , " he said saturday in an interview with a croatian daily , after several days of stern statements on the failure of bosnia .
in what became known as the " velvet divorce , " czechoslovakia dismembered in 1993 to form the czech republic and slovakia .
the two new states joined the eu nine years later .
dodik said the " federal units " of bosnia should be able to resort to self-determination after " five to 10 years . "
the dayton peace agreement ended bosnia 's 1992-1995 war and left the former yugoslav republic divided into two entities , the serb-run republika srpska and muslim-croat federation .
under the terms of the accord , each region has its own government , parliament and police , but neither is allowed to secede .
the latest political crisis erupted last month after it was reported that dodik and other bosnian serb politicians were the subject of a corruption probe .
justice authorities have yet to confirm the existence of a case against dodik , but bosnian serb leaders unanimously condemned what they called " illegal procedures " against their entity .
they have even threatened to leave central institutions , which would cause them to be blocked as the representatives of all three of bosnia 's main ethnic groups - muslims , croats , and serbs - must be present for them to function .

observers say the developments illustrate the fragility of bosnia .
" whenever we are faced with political tensions , bosnia is confronted by the risk of collapsing and its existence is questioned , " political analyst tanja topic told reporters .
for srecko latal , another political commentator , bosnia 's two entities were like the two engines of a hybrid vehicle , which meant the balkan country was " always broken down . "
the crisis emerged as the leaders of the main political parties representing muslims , croats and serbs , including dodik , were engaged in talks aimed at finding common ground for eu-backed constitutional reforms .

justice authorities have yet to confirm the existence of a case against dodik , but bosnian serb leaders unanimously condemned what they called " illegal procedures " against their entity .

observers say the developments illustrate the fragility of bosnia .
" whenever we are faced with political tensions , bosnia is confronted by the risk of collapsing and its existence is questioned , " political analyst tanja topic told reporters .
for srecko latal , another political commentator , bosnia 's two entities were like the two engines of a hybrid vehicle , which meant the balkan country was " always broken down . "
the crisis emerged as the leaders of the main political parties representing muslims , croats and serbs , including dodik , were engaged in talks aimed at finding common ground for eu-backed constitutional reforms .
" this crisis has long blocked the constitutional reform , " said topic .
the former yugoslav states of serbia and croatia , both involved in bosnia 's war and among the guarantors of the dayton peace agreement , are also involved in this crisis .
serbia offers dodik support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic gave his support to dodik serbian president boris tadic strongly denounced what he said was a campaign to undermine the " personal and professional integrity " of dodik , in a statement issued this week .
meanwhile , croatian president stipe mesic said saturday he was firmly opposed to any division of bosnia .
" this should not be permitted , for the good of europe and peace in europe , " he said . nda / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , 2005 the international tribunal to try suspects in the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri four years ago was formally constituted in the hague on sunday , march 1 . constituted under a united nations mandate , the court is to examine a number of issues , including allegations that syria was behind the killing of hariri in a massive beirut bomb blast on feb .
14 , 2005 . syria has repeatedly denied allegations of involvement in the hariri attack , in which 22 other people were also killed . court registrar robin vincent told the opening that the tribunal was in the first place not so much for the united nations or for the international community as " for lebanon . " a group of several dozen lebanese outside the heavily-fortified tribunal building - a former dutch secret service gym in the hague suburb of leidschendam-voorburg - waved national flags . historic day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saad hariri called march 1 a historic day of justice hariri 's son saad called the opening of the court a historic day for his country . " today the flag of justice for lebanon is being raised in the hague ; he said in a statement issued in beirut .
" march 1 is the fruit of the efforts of all lebanese people who supported the establishment of the court and who refused to yield to threats and terror . " four lebanese generals regarded as pro-syrian are expected to be charged by the hague court in connection with the murder .
a lebanese investigating judge friday rejected a request for their release . the four - mustafa hamdan , commander of the presidential guard , jamil sayyed , director of security services , domestic security head ali hajj , and the commander of army intelligence raymond azar - have been detained in lebanon since 2005 . canadian daniel bellemare assumed the role of the tribunal 's chief prosecutor .

bellemere has 60 days to apply to the lebanese authorities for the transfer of suspects and evidence files . the tribunal 's hearings are expected to last for several years , and it is expected that months will pass before anyone actually goes on trial . " indictments will be filed when i am satisfied i have enough evidence , " bellemare told reporters . the tribunal will operate under lebanese law - but without the death penalty - with an international panel of 11 judges and a staff of 300 under an initial mandate of three years .
the highest sentence it will be able to impose will be life imprisonment . it is financed to 49 percent by the lebanese government and 51 percent by donor nations including the united states and germany - to the tune of 40 million euros for the first year , financing which has already been guaranteed . open wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanon remains divided between supporters and opponents of syria with lebanese society still polarized into pro and anti-syrian camps , and having just emerged from an 18-month political stalemate , the tribunal is likely to aggravate wounds that have hardly healed . there is also opposition to the tribunal 's existence with some observers saying they think it could lead to conflicts in the streets similar to the ones witnessed during may 2008 , when 82 people were killed . the opposition has long claimed that the tribunal constitutes an unacceptable violation of lebanese sovereignty and that it can be politicized to serve as a tool against syria , their main ally . " the tribunal into the assassination of former prime minister rafik hariri should not be considered a tool for taking revenge or intimidation , " opposition deputy anwar al-khalil said . in comments made last week to the lebanese media , bellemare tried to assure all factions involved that the tribunal would not be a " political exercise " but " a legal process driven by legal rules . " previous un reports , including one written by german prosecutor detlev mehlis , have implicated the syrian intelligence establishment in the killing . assad has long denied any involvement in hariri 's killing and has said syria will not allow its citizens to appear before the tribunal . sms / dpa / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the tribunal into the assassination of former prime minister rafik hariri should not be considered a tool for taking revenge or intimidation , " opposition deputy anwar al-khalil said . in comments made last week to the lebanese media , bellemare tried to assure all factions involved that the tribunal would not be a " political exercise " but " a legal process driven by legal rules . " previous un reports , including one written by german prosecutor detlev mehlis , have implicated the syrian intelligence establishment in the killing . assad has long denied any involvement in hariri 's killing and has said syria will not allow its citizens to appear before the tribunal . sms / dpa / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.03.2009 eastern european nations fear rift with richer neighbors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians agreed they do n't want divisions in the eu , but internal conflict continues eu leaders tried to overcome their differences on how to address the ongoing economic crisis , but protectionism fears and unheeded calls for aid from smaller members raised fears of a " new iron curtain " in europe . heads of state and government met in brussels on sunday , march 1 , in an effort to agree on a common european response to the continuing global financial crisis that has pushed the eu into a deep recession . the eu leaders are ready to commit to putting their single market at the heart of their recovery plans and emphasize that eu efforts to promote open markets are reflected elsewhere , according to a draft summit statement . the draft being discussed by eu leaders stressed that the bloc 's single market is " the engine for recovery to support growth and jobs . " eu leaders were also to use the summit to hammer out a common position to take to a meeting of leaders from the 20 biggest economic powers in london on april 2 .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek said sunday that eu leaders would meet with us president barack obama in prague three days after the g20 meeting . sharing the burden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmaker opel is among those looking for help upon his arrival in brussels , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said , " we should not be taking jobs from each other . " the main split in the union is between rich countries , which want strong action to support industry - particularly carmakers , and poorer nations - largely located in eastern and central europe , who can not afford massive industry bail-outs . eastern european nations have also been especially hard hit by the crisis .
hungary 's prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said the time had come for richer eu members to show their solidarity with poorer countries . " we should not allow a new iron curtain to be set up and divide europe in two parts , " he warned , proposing a fund worth up to 190 billion euros -lrb- $ 240 billion -rrb- . his proposal is substantially more than the 24.5 billion euros in aid that international institutions agreed on friday to make available to eastern european countries to help them cope with the crisis .
eastern and central european economies are often dependent on credit from western sources , which has become nearly impossible to receive . no special treatment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said international aid should be looked at on a case-by-case basis but there was little sympathy for the hungarian proposal .
the european union 's current czech presidency ruled out special treatment for the region . " i do n't believe that it is necessary now to separate several countries in the european union , " the czech republic 's topolanek told journalists as he arrived to chair the emergency eu summit , adding that such aid would be offered to any eu member , not only eastern european countries . " i think that it was perfectly clear that the european union is n't going to leave anybody in the lurch , " topolanek told journalists after the meeting . as the leader of the 27-member bloc 's largest economy , german chancellor angela merkel said her country was in favor of helping european countries on a case to case basis but she has not detailed how aid would be provided .
berlin has resisted calls for a euro-zone bond to raise money for suffering countries in the shared currency zone . merkel , who arrived late to the summit due to technical difficulties with her government plane , said the bloc could not afford to lump countries together solely according to their geographic location .
she said " the situation is very different " from one eastern european nation to another , and warned of starting a debate including " massive figures " of support for the region . auto industry protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's plan to help french carmakers has some worried many eastern european countries are also growing increasingly concerned about the possible return of protectionism .
french president nicolas sarkozy made aid to its car sector conditional on companies not moving production to the region and said french carmakers should work to preserve jobs in france .
on sunday , he denied the move was rooted in protectionism . " we did n't ask to close factories in other countries , but to keep ones at home open , " he said .
" protectionism is an american problem . " the european commission deemed the french auto package on saturday to be free of protectionism , but fears of governments deciding to bail out their industries at the expense of others were not diminished . " always we must resist the temptation of protectionism , " polish prime minister donald tusk told journalists after meeting of leaders from nine eastern european countries that took place ahead of the major summit . sms / afp / dpa / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just hours before polls opened , basque police arrested a suspected eta member they believe was planning a bomb attack timed to coincide with the vote .
a total of around four million people are eligible to vote to elect regional parliaments in what are the first elections since the socialist party of prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero was returned to power one year ago .
since then , the global financial crisis has accelerated the collapse of spain 's property market after a decade-long boom , pushing the country into recession .
the unemployment rate soared to 13.9 percent in the last quarter of 2008 , the highest in the 27-nation european union .
in sunday 's polls , zapatero will be seeking to measure the degree of support he has to handle the crisis .
opinion polls indicate the socialists could end the 30-year hold on power by the basque nationalist party in the northern basque region .
historic socialist victory a possibility a socialist victory in the wealthy semi-autonomous region would mark the first time since the country returned to democracy in 1975 that the basque country is governed by a party that unquestionably backs keeping it as part of spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's socialists want the basques to remain spanish analysts credit the rise in support for the socialists in part to zapatero 's bid during his first term to negotiate peace with eta , blamed for 825 deaths in its 40-year campaign for an independent basque homeland .
those negotiations eventually failed and the group resumed its attacks .
spain 's supreme court last month banned two pro-independence parties from participating in sunday 's election due to their links to eta and its outlawed political wing batasuna .
eta responded to the court decision by staging its first attack in the spanish capital since december 2006 , setting off a van packed with explosives in a business district , causing extensive damage but no injuries .
late last month week , another eta bomb exploded outside the headquarters of the basque socialist party in the town of lazkao , causing major damage but no injuries .
the bombings raised fears that the regional election could be marred by further eta attacks .
the basque interior ministry said it is deploying 5,000 police throughout the region sunday , or more than half of its entire force of 8,000 .
popular party running ruling socialists close in galicia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popular party lives up to its name in galicia in the rugged northwestern seafaring region of galicia , the socialists hope to hold on to the power they won in 2005 , but polls point to a tight race with the conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , spain 's main opposition party .
the election results could also determine the future of pp leader mariano rajoy , who has struggled with party infighting following two successive national election defeats .
rajoy has campaigned hard in his home region of galicia , but the party has been hit by allegations of corruption in madrid and several other regions involving businessmen close to the pp .
polling stations opened in the two regions at 09:00 cet and close at 20:00 cet , when local television stations are expected to release the results of exit polls .

spain 's supreme court last month banned two pro-independence parties from participating in sunday 's election due to their links to eta and its outlawed political wing batasuna .
eta responded to the court decision by staging its first attack in the spanish capital since december 2006 , setting off a van packed with explosives in a business district , causing extensive damage but no injuries .
late last month week , another eta bomb exploded outside the headquarters of the basque socialist party in the town of lazkao , causing major damage but no injuries .
the bombings raised fears that the regional election could be marred by further eta attacks .
the basque interior ministry said it is deploying 5,000 police throughout the region sunday , or more than half of its entire force of 8,000 .

moscow has reacted furiously to plans by the former administration of george w. bush to place missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic , saying the move was directly aimed against russia .
" i am counting on the new us administration behaving on this question in a more creative and friendly way , " medvedev said in an interview with spanish media , the transcript of which was published on the kremlin website .
" we have already received positive signals from our american colleagues .
i am expecting that these signals will turn into concrete proposals , " he added .
medvedev said he hoped that this issue would be discussed in his first meeting with obama , expected to take place on the sidelines of the meeting of g20 countries in london on april 2 .
the russian president had warned last year russia would deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian enclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .
the bush administration said its plans to build a radar base in the czech republic and install interceptor missiles in poland were not directed against russia but aimed at countering missile threats from states such as iran .
" russia does not like this , that is absolutely clear , " said medvedev .
medvedev urges us to face threats with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said bush was immovable on the missile shield he said it was undeniable that there were threats to international security in the world .
" but let us react to these threats together , without isolating each other from these processes . "
medvedev complained that the bush administration 's attitude had been " very simple : ' we are doing this because we have decided it that way . " '
russian officials have repeatedly expressed optimism for the prospects for ties under obama , although the new us president has yet to give much detail on his plans for russia policies .
however a pattern could emerge in the near future , with us secretary of state hillary clinton due to have her first face-to-face meeting with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov next week .
russia 's war in georgia in august over the breakaway region of south ossetia sent relations between russia and the west plummeting to lows not seen since the collapse of the soviet union .
us vice president joe biden declared at a security conference last month it was time to " press the reset button " in relations and " revisit the many areas where we can and should work together .

the russian president had warned last year russia would deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian enclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .
the bush administration said its plans to build a radar base in the czech republic and install interceptor missiles in poland were not directed against russia but aimed at countering missile threats from states such as iran .
" russia does not like this , that is absolutely clear , " said medvedev .
medvedev urges us to face threats with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said bush was immovable on the missile shield he said it was undeniable that there were threats to international security in the world .
" but let us react to these threats together , without isolating each other from these processes . "
medvedev complained that the bush administration 's attitude had been " very simple : ' we are doing this because we have decided it that way . " '
russian officials have repeatedly expressed optimism for the prospects for ties under obama , although the new us president has yet to give much detail on his plans for russia policies .
however a pattern could emerge in the near future , with us secretary of state hillary clinton due to have her first face-to-face meeting with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov next week .
russia 's war in georgia in august over the breakaway region of south ossetia sent relations between russia and the west plummeting to lows not seen since the collapse of the soviet union .
us vice president joe biden declared at a security conference last month it was time to " press the reset button " in relations and " revisit the many areas where we can and should work together .

bayern drop a place to fifth , level on 39 points with wolfsburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg could n't find the ball against wolfsburg grafite converted his first goal from the spot in the 12th minute after dennis aogo pulled at dzeko .
he then finished off a swift counter-attack down the left in the 25th for his 14th goal of the season . though he missed the last three games because of a knee injury , grafite has now found the back of the net nine goals in his last six league games . paulo guerrero gave the home side hope with a goal in the 73rd but dzeko chalked up his 11th of the season two minutes later to inflict a first home defeat of the season for hamburg . bayern ca n't capitalize visiting bayern were unable to take advantage of the dismissal of bremen central defender naldo in the 15th minute , leaving juergen klinsmann 's side with just one win in five league games since the winter break . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann , right , had hoped to see something better against bremen " we wanted the win to get nearer the leaders , but it is not a bad result and we can live with it , " klinsmann said . naldo was shown a red card after blocking bastian schweinsteiger just outside the area in what was deemed a professional foul . bayern created a series of chances , but a lack of precision and christian vander in goal in place of injured first-choice tim wiese thwarted hamit altintop , schweinsteiger drove narrowly over the bar and tim borowski went close and saw another effort saved by the keeper . the best opportunity went to bremen 's claudio pizarro who screwed a shot wide of an open goal with 18 minutes remaining . the result leaves bremen 11th and without a win in five games , but the point will be seen as another morale-booster by thomas schaaf 's side after coming from two goals down at ac milan on thursday to eliminate the italians from the uefa cup . " we deserved the point after playing for over 70 minutes with 10 men .

bayern drop a place to fifth , level on 39 points with wolfsburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg could n't find the ball against wolfsburg grafite converted his first goal from the spot in the 12th minute after dennis aogo pulled at dzeko .
he then finished off a swift counter-attack down the left in the 25th for his 14th goal of the season . though he missed the last three games because of a knee injury , grafite has now found the back of the net nine goals in his last six league games . paulo guerrero gave the home side hope with a goal in the 73rd but dzeko chalked up his 11th of the season two minutes later to inflict a first home defeat of the season for hamburg . bayern ca n't capitalize visiting bayern were unable to take advantage of the dismissal of bremen central defender naldo in the 15th minute , leaving juergen klinsmann 's side with just one win in five league games since the winter break . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann , right , had hoped to see something better against bremen " we wanted the win to get nearer the leaders , but it is not a bad result and we can live with it , " klinsmann said . naldo was shown a red card after blocking bastian schweinsteiger just outside the area in what was deemed a professional foul . bayern created a series of chances , but a lack of precision and christian vander in goal in place of injured first-choice tim wiese thwarted hamit altintop , schweinsteiger drove narrowly over the bar and tim borowski went close and saw another effort saved by the keeper . the best opportunity went to bremen 's claudio pizarro who screwed a shot wide of an open goal with 18 minutes remaining . the result leaves bremen 11th and without a win in five games , but the point will be seen as another morale-booster by thomas schaaf 's side after coming from two goals down at ac milan on thursday to eliminate the italians from the uefa cup . " we deserved the point after playing for over 70 minutes with 10 men .
i do n't think you could expect any more than that today , " schaaf said . hertha 's close call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha had a hard time beating the bundealiga 's worst team in the day 's other game , seventh-placed vfb stuttgart earned a 2-0 win at second-to-bottom karlsruhe thanks to a goal five minutes after the break from brazilian elson and an 88th-minute strike from sami khedira . earlier in saturday 's bundesliga action , hertha berlin beat last-placed borussia moenchengladbach 2-1 and benefited from hoffenheim 's goalless draw at borussia dortmund . goals by andrey voronin and pal dardai gave berlin a comfortable half-time lead , but after arne friedrich brought down marko marin in the area and michael bradley scored from the spot in the 69th minute , hertha had a tough task on their hands to hold on to their lead . moenchengladbach threw caution to the win in the final minutes and would have deserved at least a share of the spoils as berlin showed none of the form that had taken them to the top of the standings . " it looked as if we simply forgot to play soccer in the second half , " voronin said .
" we did not deserve to win like that , but we got the three points . " room to move in dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp was disappointed by the the referees in dortmund , hoffenheim and the home side both ended the game with 10 men after referee herbert fandel sent off tobias weis and sebastian kehl in the second half . dortmund coach juergen klopp said there were many refereeing decisions during the game he could not understand . " kehl 's second booking was ridiculous and weis should also not have been sent off , " he said . hoffenheim 's andreas beck said that the side was trying to win matches , but was just not having any luck . " maybe we need to win a game with a bad 1-0 and then we can get back to our winning ways . " bayer leverkusen failed to close the gap on the leaders going down 1-0 at struggling hanover 96 , with the only goal of the game being scored by arnold bruggink . struggling schalke 04 managed a somewhat lucky 2-1 victory at eintracht frankfurt that sees them go to 34 points and keeps them challenging for an uefa cup place . at the wrong end of the table , vfl bochum twice came from behind to beat energie cottbus 3-2 to move to 14th in the table , while the visitors move down into the relegation zone in 16th . tt / sms / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we expect rapid international aid from all parties to completely rebuild gaza , " palestinian president mahmud abbas told reporters on saturday , feb .
28 . " we also expect that as in the past there will be one mechanism , the palestinian authority , " he said after meeting eu foreign policy chief javier solana in the west bank town of ramallah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has said it 's willing to work with abbas hamas has been boycotted by the major western donors , who consider it a terrorist organization and who deal exclusively with abbas ' moderate palestinian authority . the palestinian authority and hamas each want to lead the rebuilding effort , but western countries have said they will work only with abbas . " i would like to insist that the mechanism used to deploy the money is the one that represents the palestinian authority , " solana said .
" i do n't think there is a need for new mechanisms . " star delegate at the aid conference in the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh will us secretary of state hillary clinton , who will reportedly arrive bearing a check for $ 900 million -lrb- 710 million euros -rrb- . saudi arabia is expected to reaffirm a commitment to provide $ 1 billion towards reconstruction , and the european union has said it will grant $ 554 million to the palestinian people in 2009 . donor countries from the january 2008 paris conference will reiterate a pledge of $ 7.4 billion in aid to the palestinians in the three years 2008-2010 , of which $ 3 billion has so far been distributed . palestinian prime minister salam fayyad has said he is seeking $ 2.8 billion to rebuild gaza . around 75 delegations are scheduled to attend monday 's conference , which is organized by egypt and norway and sponsored by the united nations , european union , france , italy and the arab league . the 1.4-million population of the gaza strip - around half of whom depend on united nations handouts - are in dire need of help from the international community . gaza suffering under hamas-targeted measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since hamas took control of gaza , the situation has worsened the gaza economy was brought to its knees by the blockade imposed by israel from the time hamas seized control of the enclave . then israel 's 22-day onslaught on the territory in december and january caused physical devastation , destroying homes , hospitals , schools and other infrastructure as well as killing more than 1,300 palestinians . fayyad says the damage to homes has forced 90,000 people to live in tents now pitched amid the ruins . neither israel nor hamas will be represented at the gathering , but for the aid program to succeed israel must lift its blockade and hamas will have to be reconciled with the secular fatah , backbone of the palestinian authority . the rival palestinian factions have agreed to start talks aimed at working towards the formation of a " consensus " government . israeli prime minister ehud olmert has said his priority is the release of soldier gilad shalit from captivity by hamas , placing this aim above reaching a lasting truce in gaza or negotiating to lift the blockade . but egypt is continuing discussions aimed at trying to broker a long-term truce , and the middle east peace quartet will meet on the sidelines of the aid conference to discuss how to revive the peace process . clinton is expected to attend that event , as is solana , un head ban ki-moon and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said the aid conference has a double role : economic , to organize humanitarian aid and the reconstruction of gaza , and political , focused on the peace process . " the mechanism for the reconstruction will be fixed at sharm el-sheikh , " he said , but whatever is agreed can not be implemented until israel agrees to end its blockade and open border crossings into and out of gaza . high political price for hamas and israel rebuilding war-shattered gaza also carries a high political price for both israel and hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and fatah will have to cooperate to rebuild gaza hamas may need to come to terms with a return of the palestinian authority while israel could face growing pressure to reopen border crossings into gaza that have been closed since the hamas takeover to all but vital goods .
the israeli blockade was imposed in response to militant rocket and mortar fire . the blockade would have to be at least significantly eased to allow in the materials needed to rebuild the overcrowded coastal strip . and with such huge sums at stake , donors are bound to want results , not only in the daunting task of actually rebuilding gaza but also in the search for a solution to the seemingly intractable israeli-palestinian conflict . this could be particularly challenging at a time when israel 's hawkish likud leader benjamin netanyahu appears set to form a right-wing coalition government opposed to any significant concession to the palestinians . " for reconstruction to work , a new environment has to be established , " said palestinian planning minister samir abdallah .
" there has to be a climate of stability and security through a truce , but also a palestinian government that is trustworthy , " he said . hamas and abbas 's fatah faction agreed in egyptian-sponsored talks on thursday to work together towards setting up a unity government that will supervise gaza 's reconstruction . eu : donor conference an opportunity for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes the conference will provide a platform for debate solana said during a middle east tour ahead of the conference that the gathering would also be an opportunity to " create a political dynamic " in the israeli-palestinian talks . " donors ' money is political money , " said mohammed shtayyeh , who heads the palestinian economic council for development and reconstruction -lrb- pecdar -rrb- tasked by the palestinian authority to supervise donor-financed projects .
" donors also come to support the peace process , and this will emerge from sharm el-sheikh . " shtayyeh said that pecdar has 56 architects and engineers in gaza and was " ready to carry out any project it is given . " he insisted , however , that reconstruction would not be possible unless the blockade is lifted . " today one ca n't find a single bag of cement or steel bar in gaza , " he said . the international committee for the red cross stressed that efforts to rebuild gaza can only succeed if they are accompanied by credible political steps to resolve the crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 01.03.2009 conservative bishop wants holocaust denier out of spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the society of st. pius x is aware of the damage caused by williamson 's views the head of the ultra-conservative catholic community that bishop richard williamson is a member of said the holocaust-denying clergyman should stop making public statements which have damaged the order 's reputation . in an interview with the german weekly der spiegel , bernard fellay , head of the saint pius x society -lrb- sspx -rrb- , reacted to the uproar over comments williamson made that no jews died in nazi gas chambers during world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson does not believe that the holocaust took place " if he 's silent , if he stays out of sight , that would really be better for everyone , " fellay said in the interview to appear on monday .
" i hope that he drops out of public life for a long while . "
williamson would be excluded from the community " if he starts again to deny the holocaust , " he added .
" he has hurt us and damaged our reputation .
we are definitely distancing ourselves from him , " fellay said .
in a letter to the vatican released thursday , williamson apologized for his recent comments about the holocaust - but did not say whether he 's changed his views or that his comments had been erroneous .
a step in the right direction ?
the vatican turned down the apology .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said on friday that williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set forth by the vatican under which the bishop was to " distance himself unequivocally and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wanted to be admitted as a prelate in the church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson ran an sspx seminary in la reja , argentina fellay , however , considered the letter a " major step in the right direction " and that , in his view , it was unlikely that the vatican would excommunicate williamson again .
in berlin , the president of germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knobloch said on friday she was " appalled " by williamson 's latest remarks , while the council 's secretary general , stephan kramer , said that the cleric 's apology was " completely irrelevant . " " he is sorry about the pain , but has taken back nothing of substance , " kramer said .
" i believe the apology is a diversion tactic to get rid of the pressure and the limelight , " allowing the brotherhood to continue preaching their " antidemocratic , unconstitutional , misogynist , antisemitic values . "
back in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being ousted by argentina , williamson returned to england the argentine government asked the bishop to leave the south american country - where he ran an sspx seminary 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires - because his remarks on the holocaust were seen as " deeply offensive to argentine society , the jewish people and humanity . "
williamson returned to britain where he is believed to be staying with fellow priests at the offices of the society of saint pius x in the leafy southwest london suburb of wimbledon .
fellay and williamson were among four excommunicated bishops that pope benedict xvi rehabilitated last month in an attempt to heal a decades-old split with traditionalists who did not accept the reforms of the second vatican council of the early 1960s .
the vatican has said pope benedict had n't been aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he revoked his excommunication .
williamson , 68 , told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
he also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million . tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson does not believe that the holocaust took place " if he 's silent , if he stays out of sight , that would really be better for everyone , " fellay said in the interview to appear on monday .
" i hope that he drops out of public life for a long while . "
williamson would be excluded from the community " if he starts again to deny the holocaust , " he added .
" he has hurt us and damaged our reputation .
we are definitely distancing ourselves from him , " fellay said .
in a letter to the vatican released thursday , williamson apologized for his recent comments about the holocaust - but did not say whether he 's changed his views or that his comments had been erroneous .
a step in the right direction ?
the vatican turned down the apology .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said on friday that williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set forth by the vatican under which the bishop was to " distance himself unequivocally and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wanted to be admitted as a prelate in the church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson ran an sspx seminary in la reja , argentina fellay , however , considered the letter a " major step in the right direction " and that , in his view , it was unlikely that the vatican would excommunicate williamson again .
in berlin , the president of germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knobloch said on friday she was " appalled " by williamson 's latest remarks , while the council 's secretary general , stephan kramer , said that the cleric 's apology was " completely irrelevant . " " he is sorry about the pain , but has taken back nothing of substance , " kramer said .
" i believe the apology is a diversion tactic to get rid of the pressure and the limelight , " allowing the brotherhood to continue preaching their " antidemocratic , unconstitutional , misogynist , antisemitic values . "
back in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being ousted by argentina , williamson returned to england the argentine government asked the bishop to leave the south american country - where he ran an sspx seminary 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires - because his remarks on the holocaust were seen as " deeply offensive to argentine society , the jewish people and humanity . "
williamson returned to britain where he is believed to be staying with fellow priests at the offices of the society of saint pius x in the leafy southwest london suburb of wimbledon .
fellay and williamson were among four excommunicated bishops that pope benedict xvi rehabilitated last month in an attempt to heal a decades-old split with traditionalists who did not accept the reforms of the second vatican council of the early 1960s .
the vatican has said pope benedict had n't been aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he revoked his excommunication .
williamson , 68 , told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "

" we expect rapid international aid from all parties to completely rebuild gaza , " palestinian president mahmud abbas told reporters on saturday , feb .
28 . " we also expect that as in the past there will be one mechanism , the palestinian authority , " he said after meeting eu foreign policy chief javier solana in the west bank town of ramallah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has said it 's willing to work with abbas hamas has been boycotted by the major western donors , who consider it a terrorist organization and who deal exclusively with abbas ' moderate palestinian authority . the palestinian authority and hamas each want to lead the rebuilding effort , but western countries have said they will work only with abbas . " i would like to insist that the mechanism used to deploy the money is the one that represents the palestinian authority , " solana said .
" i do n't think there is a need for new mechanisms . " star delegate at the aid conference in the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh will us secretary of state hillary clinton , who will reportedly arrive bearing a check for $ 900 million -lrb- 710 million euros -rrb- . saudi arabia is expected to reaffirm a commitment to provide $ 1 billion towards reconstruction , and the european union has said it will grant $ 554 million to the palestinian people in 2009 . donor countries from the january 2008 paris conference will reiterate a pledge of $ 7.4 billion in aid to the palestinians in the three years 2008-2010 , of which $ 3 billion has so far been distributed . palestinian prime minister salam fayyad has said he is seeking $ 2.8 billion to rebuild gaza . around 75 delegations are scheduled to attend monday 's conference , which is organized by egypt and norway and sponsored by the united nations , european union , france , italy and the arab league . the 1.4-million population of the gaza strip - around half of whom depend on united nations handouts - are in dire need of help from the international community . gaza suffering under hamas-targeted measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since hamas took control of gaza , the situation has worsened the gaza economy was brought to its knees by the blockade imposed by israel from the time hamas seized control of the enclave . then israel 's 22-day onslaught on the territory in december and january caused physical devastation , destroying homes , hospitals , schools and other infrastructure as well as killing more than 1,300 palestinians . fayyad says the damage to homes has forced 90,000 people to live in tents now pitched amid the ruins . neither israel nor hamas will be represented at the gathering , but for the aid program to succeed israel must lift its blockade and hamas will have to be reconciled with the secular fatah , backbone of the palestinian authority . the rival palestinian factions have agreed to start talks aimed at working towards the formation of a " consensus " government . israeli prime minister ehud olmert has said his priority is the release of soldier gilad shalit from captivity by hamas , placing this aim above reaching a lasting truce in gaza or negotiating to lift the blockade . but egypt is continuing discussions aimed at trying to broker a long-term truce , and the middle east peace quartet will meet on the sidelines of the aid conference to discuss how to revive the peace process . clinton is expected to attend that event , as is solana , un head ban ki-moon and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said the aid conference has a double role : economic , to organize humanitarian aid and the reconstruction of gaza , and political , focused on the peace process . " the mechanism for the reconstruction will be fixed at sharm el-sheikh , " he said , but whatever is agreed can not be implemented until israel agrees to end its blockade and open border crossings into and out of gaza . high political price for hamas and israel rebuilding war-shattered gaza also carries a high political price for both israel and hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and fatah will have to cooperate to rebuild gaza hamas may need to come to terms with a return of the palestinian authority while israel could face growing pressure to reopen border crossings into gaza that have been closed since the hamas takeover to all but vital goods .
the israeli blockade was imposed in response to militant rocket and mortar fire . the blockade would have to be at least significantly eased to allow in the materials needed to rebuild the overcrowded coastal strip . and with such huge sums at stake , donors are bound to want results , not only in the daunting task of actually rebuilding gaza but also in the search for a solution to the seemingly intractable israeli-palestinian conflict . this could be particularly challenging at a time when israel 's hawkish likud leader benjamin netanyahu appears set to form a right-wing coalition government opposed to any significant concession to the palestinians . " for reconstruction to work , a new environment has to be established , " said palestinian planning minister samir abdallah .
" there has to be a climate of stability and security through a truce , but also a palestinian government that is trustworthy , " he said . hamas and abbas 's fatah faction agreed in egyptian-sponsored talks on thursday to work together towards setting up a unity government that will supervise gaza 's reconstruction . eu : donor conference an opportunity for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes the conference will provide a platform for debate solana said during a middle east tour ahead of the conference that the gathering would also be an opportunity to " create a political dynamic " in the israeli-palestinian talks . " donors ' money is political money , " said mohammed shtayyeh , who heads the palestinian economic council for development and reconstruction -lrb- pecdar -rrb- tasked by the palestinian authority to supervise donor-financed projects .
" donors also come to support the peace process , and this will emerge from sharm el-sheikh . " shtayyeh said that pecdar has 56 architects and engineers in gaza and was " ready to carry out any project it is given . " he insisted , however , that reconstruction would not be possible unless the blockade is lifted . " today one ca n't find a single bag of cement or steel bar in gaza , " he said . the international committee for the red cross stressed that efforts to rebuild gaza can only succeed if they are accompanied by credible political steps to resolve the crisis . " the first and most urgent measure should be to end the isolation of gaza , particularly by lifting restrictions on the movement of people and goods , " said icrc president jakob kellenberger . nda / sms / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there has to be a climate of stability and security through a truce , but also a palestinian government that is trustworthy , " he said . hamas and abbas 's fatah faction agreed in egyptian-sponsored talks on thursday to work together towards setting up a unity government that will supervise gaza 's reconstruction . eu : donor conference an opportunity for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes the conference will provide a platform for debate solana said during a middle east tour ahead of the conference that the gathering would also be an opportunity to " create a political dynamic " in the israeli-palestinian talks . " donors ' money is political money , " said mohammed shtayyeh , who heads the palestinian economic council for development and reconstruction -lrb- pecdar -rrb- tasked by the palestinian authority to supervise donor-financed projects .
" donors also come to support the peace process , and this will emerge from sharm el-sheikh . " shtayyeh said that pecdar has 56 architects and engineers in gaza and was " ready to carry out any project it is given . " he insisted , however , that reconstruction would not be possible unless the blockade is lifted . " today one ca n't find a single bag of cement or steel bar in gaza , " he said . the international committee for the red cross stressed that efforts to rebuild gaza can only succeed if they are accompanied by credible political steps to resolve the crisis . " the first and most urgent measure should be to end the isolation of gaza , particularly by lifting restrictions on the movement of people and goods , " said icrc president jakob kellenberger . nda / sms / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just hours before polls opened , basque police arrested a suspected eta member they believe was planning a bomb attack timed to coincide with the vote .
a total of around four million people are eligible to vote to elect regional parliaments in what are the first elections since the socialist party of prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero was returned to power one year ago .
since then , the global financial crisis has accelerated the collapse of spain 's property market after a decade-long boom , pushing the country into recession .
the unemployment rate soared to 13.9 percent in the last quarter of 2008 , the highest in the 27-nation european union .
in sunday 's polls , zapatero will be seeking to measure the degree of support he has to handle the crisis .
opinion polls indicate the socialists could end the 30-year hold on power by the basque nationalist party in the northern basque region .
historic socialist victory a possibility a socialist victory in the wealthy semi-autonomous region would mark the first time since the country returned to democracy in 1975 that the basque country is governed by a party that unquestionably backs keeping it as part of spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's socialists want the basques to remain spanish analysts credit the rise in support for the socialists in part to zapatero 's bid during his first term to negotiate peace with eta , blamed for 825 deaths in its 40-year campaign for an independent basque homeland .
those negotiations eventually failed and the group resumed its attacks .
spain 's supreme court last month banned two pro-independence parties from participating in sunday 's election due to their links to eta and its outlawed political wing batasuna .
eta responded to the court decision by staging its first attack in the spanish capital since december 2006 , setting off a van packed with explosives in a business district , causing extensive damage but no injuries .
late last month week , another eta bomb exploded outside the headquarters of the basque socialist party in the town of lazkao , causing major damage but no injuries .
the bombings raised fears that the regional election could be marred by further eta attacks .
the basque interior ministry said it is deploying 5,000 police throughout the region sunday , or more than half of its entire force of 8,000 .

the election results could also determine the future of pp leader mariano rajoy , who has struggled with party infighting following two successive national election defeats .

the demands raise the pressure on chancellor merkel as a week of economic policy review begins . both chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and the social democrats continue trying to show that another financial crisis would not occur on their watch if voters were to give them the nod in september 's parliamentary election . currently in a tenuous " grand coalition , " the parties ' leaders are scheduled to meet this week to discuss ways to ensure social justice remains a part of the german economic system after they hash out their parties ' plans in internal meetings starting monday , march 2 . the spd has pushed for tougher steps against executives who risk the well-being of their company and other employees in pursuit of steep profits .
the party last week called for a tax on stock market trading to be implemented on the eu level to get around resistance from the cdu . spd : rich will have to pay more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants the rich to dig deeper into their wallets such a tax , based on a british model of 0.5 percent of the value of the market trade , would lower speculative investing and provide the state with money from the industry responsible for the financial market crash and which is now receiving billions of euros worth of aid from the government , according to spd members . spd leaders would also discuss salary caps and accountability standards for managers , additional oversight of financial products and measures targeting tax havens , according to spd head franz muentefering . " we need tougher rules , and quickly , " he said , according to der spiegel newsmagazine .
" the coalition must do this before the election . " he added that if the christian conservative parties did not lend their support the proposals , social justice would become a central plank in the spd 's campaign platform .
higher taxes for rich germans , which most conservatives oppose , could also become a necessity , muentefering said . " the rich will have to pay more , otherwise we wo n't get the money needed for the solidarity of the social state , " he said . cdu : tax hikes a knee-jerk reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering 's spd has n't proposed raising the beer tax ... yet ?
the christian conservatives ' parliamentary group leader , volker kauder , said he was n't surprised by the spd 's call for higher taxes . " the social democrats ca n't think of anything besides raising taxes , " he told monday 's hamburger abendblatt , adding that the cdu and its bavarian sister party the christian social union would not agree to tax hikes . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate for the chancellery , said he would show the public that his party had learned from the ongoing crisis .

" we expect rapid international aid from all parties to completely rebuild gaza , " palestinian president mahmud abbas told reporters on saturday , feb .
28 . " we also expect that as in the past there will be one mechanism , the palestinian authority , " he said after meeting eu foreign policy chief javier solana in the west bank town of ramallah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has said it 's willing to work with abbas hamas has been boycotted by the major western donors , who consider it a terrorist organization and who deal exclusively with abbas ' moderate palestinian authority . the palestinian authority and hamas each want to lead the rebuilding effort , but western countries have said they will work only with abbas . " i would like to insist that the mechanism used to deploy the money is the one that represents the palestinian authority , " solana said .
" i do n't think there is a need for new mechanisms . " star delegate at the aid conference in the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh will us secretary of state hillary clinton , who will reportedly arrive bearing a check for $ 900 million -lrb- 710 million euros -rrb- . saudi arabia is expected to reaffirm a commitment to provide $ 1 billion towards reconstruction , and the european union has said it will grant $ 554 million to the palestinian people in 2009 . donor countries from the january 2008 paris conference will reiterate a pledge of $ 7.4 billion in aid to the palestinians in the three years 2008-2010 , of which $ 3 billion has so far been distributed . palestinian prime minister salam fayyad has said he is seeking $ 2.8 billion to rebuild gaza . around 75 delegations are scheduled to attend monday 's conference , which is organized by egypt and norway and sponsored by the united nations , european union , france , italy and the arab league . the 1.4-million population of the gaza strip - around half of whom depend on united nations handouts - are in dire need of help from the international community . gaza suffering under hamas-targeted measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since hamas took control of gaza , the situation has worsened the gaza economy was brought to its knees by the blockade imposed by israel from the time hamas seized control of the enclave . then israel 's 22-day onslaught on the territory in december and january caused physical devastation , destroying homes , hospitals , schools and other infrastructure as well as killing more than 1,300 palestinians . fayyad says the damage to homes has forced 90,000 people to live in tents now pitched amid the ruins . neither israel nor hamas will be represented at the gathering , but for the aid program to succeed israel must lift its blockade and hamas will have to be reconciled with the secular fatah , backbone of the palestinian authority . the rival palestinian factions have agreed to start talks aimed at working towards the formation of a " consensus " government . israeli prime minister ehud olmert has said his priority is the release of soldier gilad shalit from captivity by hamas , placing this aim above reaching a lasting truce in gaza or negotiating to lift the blockade . but egypt is continuing discussions aimed at trying to broker a long-term truce , and the middle east peace quartet will meet on the sidelines of the aid conference to discuss how to revive the peace process . clinton is expected to attend that event , as is solana , un head ban ki-moon and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said the aid conference has a double role : economic , to organize humanitarian aid and the reconstruction of gaza , and political , focused on the peace process . " the mechanism for the reconstruction will be fixed at sharm el-sheikh , " he said , but whatever is agreed can not be implemented until israel agrees to end its blockade and open border crossings into and out of gaza . high political price for hamas and israel rebuilding war-shattered gaza also carries a high political price for both israel and hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and fatah will have to cooperate to rebuild gaza hamas may need to come to terms with a return of the palestinian authority while israel could face growing pressure to reopen border crossings into gaza that have been closed since the hamas takeover to all but vital goods .
the israeli blockade was imposed in response to militant rocket and mortar fire . the blockade would have to be at least significantly eased to allow in the materials needed to rebuild the overcrowded coastal strip . and with such huge sums at stake , donors are bound to want results , not only in the daunting task of actually rebuilding gaza but also in the search for a solution to the seemingly intractable israeli-palestinian conflict . this could be particularly challenging at a time when israel 's hawkish likud leader benjamin netanyahu appears set to form a right-wing coalition government opposed to any significant concession to the palestinians . " for reconstruction to work , a new environment has to be established , " said palestinian planning minister samir abdallah .
" there has to be a climate of stability and security through a truce , but also a palestinian government that is trustworthy , " he said . hamas and abbas 's fatah faction agreed in egyptian-sponsored talks on thursday to work together towards setting up a unity government that will supervise gaza 's reconstruction . eu : donor conference an opportunity for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes the conference will provide a platform for debate solana said during a middle east tour ahead of the conference that the gathering would also be an opportunity to " create a political dynamic " in the israeli-palestinian talks . " donors ' money is political money , " said mohammed shtayyeh , who heads the palestinian economic council for development and reconstruction -lrb- pecdar -rrb- tasked by the palestinian authority to supervise donor-financed projects .
" donors also come to support the peace process , and this will emerge from sharm el-sheikh . " shtayyeh said that pecdar has 56 architects and engineers in gaza and was " ready to carry out any project it is given . " he insisted , however , that reconstruction would not be possible unless the blockade is lifted . " today one ca n't find a single bag of cement or steel bar in gaza , " he said . the international committee for the red cross stressed that efforts to rebuild gaza can only succeed if they are accompanied by credible political steps to resolve the crisis .

bayern drop a place to fifth , level on 39 points with wolfsburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg could n't find the ball against wolfsburg grafite converted his first goal from the spot in the 12th minute after dennis aogo pulled at dzeko .
he then finished off a swift counter-attack down the left in the 25th for his 14th goal of the season . though he missed the last three games because of a knee injury , grafite has now found the back of the net nine goals in his last six league games . paulo guerrero gave the home side hope with a goal in the 73rd but dzeko chalked up his 11th of the season two minutes later to inflict a first home defeat of the season for hamburg . bayern ca n't capitalize visiting bayern were unable to take advantage of the dismissal of bremen central defender naldo in the 15th minute , leaving juergen klinsmann 's side with just one win in five league games since the winter break . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann , right , had hoped to see something better against bremen " we wanted the win to get nearer the leaders , but it is not a bad result and we can live with it , " klinsmann said . naldo was shown a red card after blocking bastian schweinsteiger just outside the area in what was deemed a professional foul . bayern created a series of chances , but a lack of precision and christian vander in goal in place of injured first-choice tim wiese thwarted hamit altintop , schweinsteiger drove narrowly over the bar and tim borowski went close and saw another effort saved by the keeper . the best opportunity went to bremen 's claudio pizarro who screwed a shot wide of an open goal with 18 minutes remaining . the result leaves bremen 11th and without a win in five games , but the point will be seen as another morale-booster by thomas schaaf 's side after coming from two goals down at ac milan on thursday to eliminate the italians from the uefa cup . " we deserved the point after playing for over 70 minutes with 10 men .
i do n't think you could expect any more than that today , " schaaf said . hertha 's close call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha had a hard time beating the bundealiga 's worst team in the day 's other game , seventh-placed vfb stuttgart earned a 2-0 win at second-to-bottom karlsruhe thanks to a goal five minutes after the break from brazilian elson and an 88th-minute strike from sami khedira . earlier in saturday 's bundesliga action , hertha berlin beat last-placed borussia moenchengladbach 2-1 and benefited from hoffenheim 's goalless draw at borussia dortmund . goals by andrey voronin and pal dardai gave berlin a comfortable half-time lead , but after arne friedrich brought down marko marin in the area and michael bradley scored from the spot in the 69th minute , hertha had a tough task on their hands to hold on to their lead . moenchengladbach threw caution to the win in the final minutes and would have deserved at least a share of the spoils as berlin showed none of the form that had taken them to the top of the standings . " it looked as if we simply forgot to play soccer in the second half , " voronin said .
" we did not deserve to win like that , but we got the three points . " room to move in dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp was disappointed by the the referees in dortmund , hoffenheim and the home side both ended the game with 10 men after referee herbert fandel sent off tobias weis and sebastian kehl in the second half . dortmund coach juergen klopp said there were many refereeing decisions during the game he could not understand . " kehl 's second booking was ridiculous and weis should also not have been sent off , " he said . hoffenheim 's andreas beck said that the side was trying to win matches , but was just not having any luck . " maybe we need to win a game with a bad 1-0 and then we can get back to our winning ways . " bayer leverkusen failed to close the gap on the leaders going down 1-0 at struggling hanover 96 , with the only goal of the game being scored by arnold bruggink . struggling schalke 04 managed a somewhat lucky 2-1 victory at eintracht frankfurt that sees them go to 34 points and keeps them challenging for an uefa cup place . at the wrong end of the table , vfl bochum twice came from behind to beat energie cottbus 3-2 to move to 14th in the table , while the visitors move down into the relegation zone in 16th . tt / sms / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we expect rapid international aid from all parties to completely rebuild gaza , " palestinian president mahmud abbas told reporters on saturday , feb .
28 . " we also expect that as in the past there will be one mechanism , the palestinian authority , " he said after meeting eu foreign policy chief javier solana in the west bank town of ramallah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has said it 's willing to work with abbas hamas has been boycotted by the major western donors , who consider it a terrorist organization and who deal exclusively with abbas ' moderate palestinian authority . the palestinian authority and hamas each want to lead the rebuilding effort , but western countries have said they will work only with abbas . " i would like to insist that the mechanism used to deploy the money is the one that represents the palestinian authority , " solana said .
" i do n't think there is a need for new mechanisms . " star delegate at the aid conference in the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh will us secretary of state hillary clinton , who will reportedly arrive bearing a check for $ 900 million -lrb- 710 million euros -rrb- . saudi arabia is expected to reaffirm a commitment to provide $ 1 billion towards reconstruction , and the european union has said it will grant $ 554 million to the palestinian people in 2009 . donor countries from the january 2008 paris conference will reiterate a pledge of $ 7.4 billion in aid to the palestinians in the three years 2008-2010 , of which $ 3 billion has so far been distributed . palestinian prime minister salam fayyad has said he is seeking $ 2.8 billion to rebuild gaza . around 75 delegations are scheduled to attend monday 's conference , which is organized by egypt and norway and sponsored by the united nations , european union , france , italy and the arab league . the 1.4-million population of the gaza strip - around half of whom depend on united nations handouts - are in dire need of help from the international community . gaza suffering under hamas-targeted measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since hamas took control of gaza , the situation has worsened the gaza economy was brought to its knees by the blockade imposed by israel from the time hamas seized control of the enclave . then israel 's 22-day onslaught on the territory in december and january caused physical devastation , destroying homes , hospitals , schools and other infrastructure as well as killing more than 1,300 palestinians . fayyad says the damage to homes has forced 90,000 people to live in tents now pitched amid the ruins . neither israel nor hamas will be represented at the gathering , but for the aid program to succeed israel must lift its blockade and hamas will have to be reconciled with the secular fatah , backbone of the palestinian authority . the rival palestinian factions have agreed to start talks aimed at working towards the formation of a " consensus " government . israeli prime minister ehud olmert has said his priority is the release of soldier gilad shalit from captivity by hamas , placing this aim above reaching a lasting truce in gaza or negotiating to lift the blockade . but egypt is continuing discussions aimed at trying to broker a long-term truce , and the middle east peace quartet will meet on the sidelines of the aid conference to discuss how to revive the peace process . clinton is expected to attend that event , as is solana , un head ban ki-moon and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov . egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said the aid conference has a double role : economic , to organize humanitarian aid and the reconstruction of gaza , and political , focused on the peace process . " the mechanism for the reconstruction will be fixed at sharm el-sheikh , " he said , but whatever is agreed can not be implemented until israel agrees to end its blockade and open border crossings into and out of gaza . high political price for hamas and israel rebuilding war-shattered gaza also carries a high political price for both israel and hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and fatah will have to cooperate to rebuild gaza hamas may need to come to terms with a return of the palestinian authority while israel could face growing pressure to reopen border crossings into gaza that have been closed since the hamas takeover to all but vital goods .
the israeli blockade was imposed in response to militant rocket and mortar fire . the blockade would have to be at least significantly eased to allow in the materials needed to rebuild the overcrowded coastal strip . and with such huge sums at stake , donors are bound to want results , not only in the daunting task of actually rebuilding gaza but also in the search for a solution to the seemingly intractable israeli-palestinian conflict . this could be particularly challenging at a time when israel 's hawkish likud leader benjamin netanyahu appears set to form a right-wing coalition government opposed to any significant concession to the palestinians . " for reconstruction to work , a new environment has to be established , " said palestinian planning minister samir abdallah .
" there has to be a climate of stability and security through a truce , but also a palestinian government that is trustworthy , " he said . hamas and abbas 's fatah faction agreed in egyptian-sponsored talks on thursday to work together towards setting up a unity government that will supervise gaza 's reconstruction . eu : donor conference an opportunity for dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana hopes the conference will provide a platform for debate solana said during a middle east tour ahead of the conference that the gathering would also be an opportunity to " create a political dynamic " in the israeli-palestinian talks . " donors ' money is political money , " said mohammed shtayyeh , who heads the palestinian economic council for development and reconstruction -lrb- pecdar -rrb- tasked by the palestinian authority to supervise donor-financed projects .
" donors also come to support the peace process , and this will emerge from sharm el-sheikh . " shtayyeh said that pecdar has 56 architects and engineers in gaza and was " ready to carry out any project it is given . " he insisted , however , that reconstruction would not be possible unless the blockade is lifted . " today one ca n't find a single bag of cement or steel bar in gaza , " he said . the international committee for the red cross stressed that efforts to rebuild gaza can only succeed if they are accompanied by credible political steps to resolve the crisis . " the first and most urgent measure should be to end the isolation of gaza , particularly by lifting restrictions on the movement of people and goods , " said icrc president jakob kellenberger . nda / sms / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we suggest that bosnia be transformed into a federation in which the federal units shall have the right to self-determination , " bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik said .
" why should n't we go the way of czechoslovakia , and meet up in the european union , " he said saturday in an interview with a croatian daily , after several days of stern statements on the failure of bosnia .
in what became known as the " velvet divorce , " czechoslovakia dismembered in 1993 to form the czech republic and slovakia .
the two new states joined the eu nine years later .
dodik said the " federal units " of bosnia should be able to resort to self-determination after " five to 10 years . "
the dayton peace agreement ended bosnia 's 1992-1995 war and left the former yugoslav republic divided into two entities , the serb-run republika srpska and muslim-croat federation .
under the terms of the accord , each region has its own government , parliament and police , but neither is allowed to secede .
the latest political crisis erupted last month after it was reported that dodik and other bosnian serb politicians were the subject of a corruption probe .
justice authorities have yet to confirm the existence of a case against dodik , but bosnian serb leaders unanimously condemned what they called " illegal procedures " against their entity .
they have even threatened to leave central institutions , which would cause them to be blocked as the representatives of all three of bosnia 's main ethnic groups - muslims , croats , and serbs - must be present for them to function .
bosnian serb pm threatens split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik says that any split would be permanent " if we walk out , we will never come back , " dodik said in comments published in sarajevo 's dnevni avaz on friday .
he denounced as " farcical " the investigation that has been launched against him , adding : " i lost the little confidence i had in the bosnian state . "
observers say the developments illustrate the fragility of bosnia .
" whenever we are faced with political tensions , bosnia is confronted by the risk of collapsing and its existence is questioned , " political analyst tanja topic told reporters .
for srecko latal , another political commentator , bosnia 's two entities were like the two engines of a hybrid vehicle , which meant the balkan country was " always broken down . "
the crisis emerged as the leaders of the main political parties representing muslims , croats and serbs , including dodik , were engaged in talks aimed at finding common ground for eu-backed constitutional reforms .
" this crisis has long blocked the constitutional reform , " said topic .
the former yugoslav states of serbia and croatia , both involved in bosnia 's war and among the guarantors of the dayton peace agreement , are also involved in this crisis .

" we suggest that bosnia be transformed into a federation in which the federal units shall have the right to self-determination , " bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik said .
" why should n't we go the way of czechoslovakia , and meet up in the european union , " he said saturday in an interview with a croatian daily , after several days of stern statements on the failure of bosnia .
in what became known as the " velvet divorce , " czechoslovakia dismembered in 1993 to form the czech republic and slovakia .
the two new states joined the eu nine years later .
dodik said the " federal units " of bosnia should be able to resort to self-determination after " five to 10 years . "
the dayton peace agreement ended bosnia 's 1992-1995 war and left the former yugoslav republic divided into two entities , the serb-run republika srpska and muslim-croat federation .
under the terms of the accord , each region has its own government , parliament and police , but neither is allowed to secede .
the latest political crisis erupted last month after it was reported that dodik and other bosnian serb politicians were the subject of a corruption probe .
justice authorities have yet to confirm the existence of a case against dodik , but bosnian serb leaders unanimously condemned what they called " illegal procedures " against their entity .
they have even threatened to leave central institutions , which would cause them to be blocked as the representatives of all three of bosnia 's main ethnic groups - muslims , croats , and serbs - must be present for them to function .
bosnian serb pm threatens split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik says that any split would be permanent " if we walk out , we will never come back , " dodik said in comments published in sarajevo 's dnevni avaz on friday .
he denounced as " farcical " the investigation that has been launched against him , adding : " i lost the little confidence i had in the bosnian state . "
observers say the developments illustrate the fragility of bosnia .
" whenever we are faced with political tensions , bosnia is confronted by the risk of collapsing and its existence is questioned , " political analyst tanja topic told reporters .
for srecko latal , another political commentator , bosnia 's two entities were like the two engines of a hybrid vehicle , which meant the balkan country was " always broken down . "
the crisis emerged as the leaders of the main political parties representing muslims , croats and serbs , including dodik , were engaged in talks aimed at finding common ground for eu-backed constitutional reforms .
" this crisis has long blocked the constitutional reform , " said topic .
the former yugoslav states of serbia and croatia , both involved in bosnia 's war and among the guarantors of the dayton peace agreement , are also involved in this crisis .
serbia offers dodik support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic gave his support to dodik serbian president boris tadic strongly denounced what he said was a campaign to undermine the " personal and professional integrity " of dodik , in a statement issued this week .
meanwhile , croatian president stipe mesic said saturday he was firmly opposed to any division of bosnia .
" this should not be permitted , for the good of europe and peace in europe , " he said . nda / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hungary 's prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said the time had come for richer eu members to show their solidarity with poorer countries . " we should not allow a new iron curtain to be set up and divide europe in two parts , " he warned , proposing a fund worth up to 190 billion euros -lrb- $ 240 billion -rrb- . his proposal is substantially more than the 24.5 billion euros in aid that international institutions agreed on friday to make available to eastern european countries to help them cope with the crisis .

" we suggest that bosnia be transformed into a federation in which the federal units shall have the right to self-determination , " bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik said .
" why should n't we go the way of czechoslovakia , and meet up in the european union , " he said saturday in an interview with a croatian daily , after several days of stern statements on the failure of bosnia .
in what became known as the " velvet divorce , " czechoslovakia dismembered in 1993 to form the czech republic and slovakia .
the two new states joined the eu nine years later .
dodik said the " federal units " of bosnia should be able to resort to self-determination after " five to 10 years . "
the dayton peace agreement ended bosnia 's 1992-1995 war and left the former yugoslav republic divided into two entities , the serb-run republika srpska and muslim-croat federation .
under the terms of the accord , each region has its own government , parliament and police , but neither is allowed to secede .
the latest political crisis erupted last month after it was reported that dodik and other bosnian serb politicians were the subject of a corruption probe .
justice authorities have yet to confirm the existence of a case against dodik , but bosnian serb leaders unanimously condemned what they called " illegal procedures " against their entity .
they have even threatened to leave central institutions , which would cause them to be blocked as the representatives of all three of bosnia 's main ethnic groups - muslims , croats , and serbs - must be present for them to function .
bosnian serb pm threatens split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik says that any split would be permanent " if we walk out , we will never come back , " dodik said in comments published in sarajevo 's dnevni avaz on friday .
he denounced as " farcical " the investigation that has been launched against him , adding : " i lost the little confidence i had in the bosnian state . "
observers say the developments illustrate the fragility of bosnia .
" whenever we are faced with political tensions , bosnia is confronted by the risk of collapsing and its existence is questioned , " political analyst tanja topic told reporters .
for srecko latal , another political commentator , bosnia 's two entities were like the two engines of a hybrid vehicle , which meant the balkan country was " always broken down . "
the crisis emerged as the leaders of the main political parties representing muslims , croats and serbs , including dodik , were engaged in talks aimed at finding common ground for eu-backed constitutional reforms .
" this crisis has long blocked the constitutional reform , " said topic .
the former yugoslav states of serbia and croatia , both involved in bosnia 's war and among the guarantors of the dayton peace agreement , are also involved in this crisis .
serbia offers dodik support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic gave his support to dodik serbian president boris tadic strongly denounced what he said was a campaign to undermine the " personal and professional integrity " of dodik , in a statement issued this week .
meanwhile , croatian president stipe mesic said saturday he was firmly opposed to any division of bosnia .
" this should not be permitted , for the good of europe and peace in europe , " he said . nda / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson does not believe that the holocaust took place " if he 's silent , if he stays out of sight , that would really be better for everyone , " fellay said in the interview to appear on monday .
" i hope that he drops out of public life for a long while . "
williamson would be excluded from the community " if he starts again to deny the holocaust , " he added .
" he has hurt us and damaged our reputation .
we are definitely distancing ourselves from him , " fellay said .
in a letter to the vatican released thursday , williamson apologized for his recent comments about the holocaust - but did not say whether he 's changed his views or that his comments had been erroneous .
a step in the right direction ?
the vatican turned down the apology .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said on friday that williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set forth by the vatican under which the bishop was to " distance himself unequivocally and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wanted to be admitted as a prelate in the church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson ran an sspx seminary in la reja , argentina fellay , however , considered the letter a " major step in the right direction " and that , in his view , it was unlikely that the vatican would excommunicate williamson again .
in berlin , the president of germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knobloch said on friday she was " appalled " by williamson 's latest remarks , while the council 's secretary general , stephan kramer , said that the cleric 's apology was " completely irrelevant . " " he is sorry about the pain , but has taken back nothing of substance , " kramer said .
" i believe the apology is a diversion tactic to get rid of the pressure and the limelight , " allowing the brotherhood to continue preaching their " antidemocratic , unconstitutional , misogynist , antisemitic values . "

"
williamson returned to britain where he is believed to be staying with fellow priests at the offices of the society of saint pius x in the leafy southwest london suburb of wimbledon .
fellay and williamson were among four excommunicated bishops that pope benedict xvi rehabilitated last month in an attempt to heal a decades-old split with traditionalists who did not accept the reforms of the second vatican council of the early 1960s .
the vatican has said pope benedict had n't been aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he revoked his excommunication .
williamson , 68 , told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson does not believe that the holocaust took place " if he 's silent , if he stays out of sight , that would really be better for everyone , " fellay said in the interview to appear on monday .
" i hope that he drops out of public life for a long while . "
williamson would be excluded from the community " if he starts again to deny the holocaust , " he added .
" he has hurt us and damaged our reputation .
we are definitely distancing ourselves from him , " fellay said .
in a letter to the vatican released thursday , williamson apologized for his recent comments about the holocaust - but did not say whether he 's changed his views or that his comments had been erroneous .
a step in the right direction ?
the vatican turned down the apology .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said on friday that williamson " does n't seem to have respected the conditions " set forth by the vatican under which the bishop was to " distance himself unequivocally and publicly " from his positions concerning the holocaust if he wanted to be admitted as a prelate in the church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson ran an sspx seminary in la reja , argentina fellay , however , considered the letter a " major step in the right direction " and that , in his view , it was unlikely that the vatican would excommunicate williamson again .
in berlin , the president of germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knobloch said on friday she was " appalled " by williamson 's latest remarks , while the council 's secretary general , stephan kramer , said that the cleric 's apology was " completely irrelevant . " " he is sorry about the pain , but has taken back nothing of substance , " kramer said .
" i believe the apology is a diversion tactic to get rid of the pressure and the limelight , " allowing the brotherhood to continue preaching their " antidemocratic , unconstitutional , misogynist , antisemitic values . "
back in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after being ousted by argentina , williamson returned to england the argentine government asked the bishop to leave the south american country - where he ran an sspx seminary 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of buenos aires - because his remarks on the holocaust were seen as " deeply offensive to argentine society , the jewish people and humanity . "
williamson returned to britain where he is believed to be staying with fellow priests at the offices of the society of saint pius x in the leafy southwest london suburb of wimbledon .
fellay and williamson were among four excommunicated bishops that pope benedict xvi rehabilitated last month in an attempt to heal a decades-old split with traditionalists who did not accept the reforms of the second vatican council of the early 1960s .
the vatican has said pope benedict had n't been aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he revoked his excommunication .
williamson , 68 , told a swedish television crew last month that " not one jew was killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies . "
he also said he did not believe that any more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , when historians put the figure at 6 million . tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" eu leaders were also to use the summit to hammer out a common position to take to a meeting of leaders from the 20 biggest economic powers in london on april 2 .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek said sunday that eu leaders would meet with us president barack obama in prague three days after the g20 meeting . sharing the burden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmaker opel is among those looking for help upon his arrival in brussels , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said , " we should not be taking jobs from each other . " the main split in the union is between rich countries , which want strong action to support industry - particularly carmakers , and poorer nations - largely located in eastern and central europe , who can not afford massive industry bail-outs . eastern european nations have also been especially hard hit by the crisis .
hungary 's prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said the time had come for richer eu members to show their solidarity with poorer countries . " we should not allow a new iron curtain to be set up and divide europe in two parts , " he warned , proposing a fund worth up to 190 billion euros -lrb- $ 240 billion -rrb- . his proposal is substantially more than the 24.5 billion euros in aid that international institutions agreed on friday to make available to eastern european countries to help them cope with the crisis .
eastern and central european economies are often dependent on credit from western sources , which has become nearly impossible to receive . no special treatment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said international aid should be looked at on a case-by-case basis but there was little sympathy for the hungarian proposal .
the european union 's current czech presidency ruled out special treatment for the region . " i do n't believe that it is necessary now to separate several countries in the european union , " the czech republic 's topolanek told journalists as he arrived to chair the emergency eu summit , adding that such aid would be offered to any eu member , not only eastern european countries . " i think that it was perfectly clear that the european union is n't going to leave anybody in the lurch , " topolanek told journalists after the meeting . as the leader of the 27-member bloc 's largest economy , german chancellor angela merkel said her country was in favor of helping european countries on a case to case basis but she has not detailed how aid would be provided .
berlin has resisted calls for a euro-zone bond to raise money for suffering countries in the shared currency zone . merkel , who arrived late to the summit due to technical difficulties with her government plane , said the bloc could not afford to lump countries together solely according to their geographic location .
she said " the situation is very different " from one eastern european nation to another , and warned of starting a debate including " massive figures " of support for the region . auto industry protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's plan to help french carmakers has some worried many eastern european countries are also growing increasingly concerned about the possible return of protectionism .
french president nicolas sarkozy made aid to its car sector conditional on companies not moving production to the region and said french carmakers should work to preserve jobs in france .
on sunday , he denied the move was rooted in protectionism . " we did n't ask to close factories in other countries , but to keep ones at home open , " he said .
" protectionism is an american problem . " the european commission deemed the french auto package on saturday to be free of protectionism , but fears of governments deciding to bail out their industries at the expense of others were not diminished . " always we must resist the temptation of protectionism , " polish prime minister donald tusk told journalists after meeting of leaders from nine eastern european countries that took place ahead of the major summit . sms / afp / dpa / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say some schools could lose a quarter of their sixth form budgets and courses and jobs may disappear .
from 1 april the welsh assembly government will cut budgets for the education of 16-18-year-olds by 7.4 % .
assembly government minister john griffiths said the cut reflected a tight budget across departments , but it would not narrow student choice .
teachers ' representatives claim that the situation is made worse because once cuts are passed on to schools by local authorities they will not be capped at 7.4 % .
anna brychan , director of the national association of head teachers cymru , -lrb- naht -rrb- told sunday 's the politics show wales that some schools were reporting a cut in their post-16 budget of up to 28 % . "
it makes the funding system post-16 unstable and inevitably puts jobs at risk " anna brychan , national association of head teachers cymru " that 's a huge , unexpected reduction , " she said .
" it 's not sustainable , it makes the funding system post-16 unstable and inevitably puts jobs at risk . "
she also said many naht members thought there was a " hidden agenda " to move away from having sixth forms in schools , and that " a very great number of them " feared for the future of sixth forms in wales .
brian lightman , the immediate past president of the association of school and college leaders , said : " i think it 's going to have an absolutely disastrous effect on the operation of post-16 education in wales .
" it 's a massive cut and it 's been applied across the board . "
unions said the threat to teaching jobs was considerable , and schools would not be able to offer as wide a range of courses .
student choice they argued that that flew in the face of the stated intention to increase the breadth of the post-16 curriculum , and put young people in wales at a disadvantage , compared to elsewhere in the uk .
mr lightman said : " there 's never been a time where getting qualifications and staying on in education has been more important , and if we compare the situation in england where they 're raising the participation age to 18 , you 're seeing a situation here where some students may not be able to access precisely those qualifications they 're going to need to be competitive in a very very difficult employment market . "
but mr griffiths said the assembly government 's learning and skills measure , which is in the process of becoming law , would actually increase student choice .
he added : " of course there are funding issues and that 7.4 % cut was produced because of the very tight funding settlement that we face in the welsh assembly government . "
conservative am andrew rt davies said people would wonder why the department for children , education , lifelong learning and skills needed to implement this cut , given that it will have a 5 % rise in its overall budget .
he claims the department miscalculated the cost of other policies such as the foundation phase for young children .
mr davies said : " they are robbing peter to pay paul . "
mr griffiths , the deputy minister for skills , also denied speculation raised by some that the assembly government wanted to see an end to sixth forms within schools in favour of a post-16 education system centred on sixth form colleges and further education institutions .

they say some schools could lose a quarter of their sixth form budgets and courses and jobs may disappear .
from 1 april the welsh assembly government will cut budgets for the education of 16-18-year-olds by 7.4 % .
assembly government minister john griffiths said the cut reflected a tight budget across departments , but it would not narrow student choice .
teachers ' representatives claim that the situation is made worse because once cuts are passed on to schools by local authorities they will not be capped at 7.4 % .
anna brychan , director of the national association of head teachers cymru , -lrb- naht -rrb- told sunday 's the politics show wales that some schools were reporting a cut in their post-16 budget of up to 28 % .
it makes the funding system post-16 unstable and inevitably puts jobs at risk anna brychan , national association of head teachers cymru " that 's a huge , unexpected reduction , " she said .
" it 's not sustainable , it makes the funding system post-16 unstable and inevitably puts jobs at risk . "
she also said many naht members thought there was a " hidden agenda " to move away from having sixth forms in schools , and that " a very great number of them " feared for the future of sixth forms in wales .
brian lightman , the immediate past president of the association of school and college leaders , said : " i think it 's going to have an absolutely disastrous effect on the operation of post-16 education in wales .
" it 's a massive cut and it 's been applied across the board . "
unions said the threat to teaching jobs was considerable , and schools would not be able to offer as wide a range of courses .
student choice they argued that that flew in the face of the stated intention to increase the breadth of the post-16 curriculum , and put young people in wales at a disadvantage , compared to elsewhere in the uk .
mr lightman said : " there 's never been a time where getting qualifications and staying on in education has been more important , and if we compare the situation in england where they 're raising the participation age to 18 , you 're seeing a situation here where some students may not be able to access precisely those qualifications they 're going to need to be competitive in a very very difficult employment market . "
but mr griffiths said the assembly government 's learning and skills measure , which is in the process of becoming law , would actually increase student choice .
he added : " of course there are funding issues and that 7.4 % cut was produced because of the very tight funding settlement that we face in the welsh assembly government . "
conservative am andrew rt davies said people would wonder why the department for children , education , lifelong learning and skills needed to implement this cut , given that it will have a 5 % rise in its overall budget .
he claims the department miscalculated the cost of other policies such as the foundation phase for young children .
mr davies said : " they are robbing peter to pay paul . "
mr griffiths , the deputy minister for skills , also denied speculation raised by some that the assembly government wanted to see an end to sixth forms within schools in favour of a post-16 education system centred on sixth form colleges and further education institutions .
he said the assembly government did want post-16 education to change , and some areas might favour a tertiary system with sixth form colleges , whilst others would see closer working between school sixth forms and fe colleges .

the 10 countries in the asean group endorsed measures to stimulate economic activity , ease access to credit , and stand firm against trade protectionism .
they also called for reform of the international financial system to take more account of developing countries .
their regional grouping also aims to be an economic community by 2015 .
the association of south east asian nations ' statement at the end of its summit in thailand included the goal of a forming a community similar to the european union .
however , the nations stressed that the eu was an inspiration and not a model .
it is clear from the limited progress that integration of the diverse countries is likely to take longer than six years , says bbc correspondent jonathan head in bangkok .
human rights were a particular issue for the grouping , which includes non-democratic countries burma and vietnam .
asean also made much of its first charter of rules - but it has established no mechanism for enforcing them on its members , our correspondent adds .
small steps but in the economic sphere , asean has made more headway , signing a landmark free trade agreement with trading partners australia and new zealand .
in one of the less high-profile agreements to come out of the summit , dentists are now allowed to practice throughout the region .
such incremental steps are slowly building co-operation , our correspondent adds .
asean members include indonesia , singapore , malaysia , philippines , thailand , brunei , cambodia and laos .
now in its 14th year , the annual summit traditionally focused on human rights , but the worldwide financial crisis was top of the agenda this year .
several powerful asian economies have seen their fortunes reversed as the economic downturn continues to bite .

the 10 countries in the asean group endorsed measures to stimulate economic activity , ease access to credit , and stand firm against trade protectionism .
they also called for reform of the international financial system to take more account of developing countries .
their regional grouping also aims to be an economic community by 2015 .
the association of south east asian nations ' statement at the end of its summit in thailand included the goal of a forming a community similar to the european union .
however , the nations stressed that the eu was an inspiration and not a model .
it is clear from the limited progress that integration of the diverse countries is likely to take longer than six years , says bbc correspondent jonathan head in bangkok .
human rights were a particular issue for the grouping , which includes non-democratic countries burma and vietnam .
asean also made much of its first charter of rules - but it has established no mechanism for enforcing them on its members , our correspondent adds .
small steps but in the economic sphere , asean has made more headway , signing a landmark free trade agreement with trading partners australia and new zealand .
in one of the less high-profile agreements to come out of the summit , dentists are now allowed to practice throughout the region .
such incremental steps are slowly building co-operation , our correspondent adds .
asean members include indonesia , singapore , malaysia , philippines , thailand , brunei , cambodia and laos .
now in its 14th year , the annual summit traditionally focused on human rights , but the worldwide financial crisis was top of the agenda this year .
several powerful asian economies have seen their fortunes reversed as the economic downturn continues to bite .
