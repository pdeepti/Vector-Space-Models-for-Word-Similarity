" there is an overarching theme to the trip to brussels which is the reconnection of the united states with europe and really a sense of consolidating this enormous political goodwill on both sides of the atlantic and harnessing it to a common agenda , " us assistant secretary of state for european affairs daniel fried said on friday .
the bush administration had a strained relationship with some european allies in the aftermath of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
but obama 's election was warmly welcomed in european capitals .
clinton at gaza donors ' conference clinton will begin her visit in the middle east on monday where she is to attend a donors ' conference aimed at rebuilding the gaza strip .
the conference will be held at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
she is also to visit israel and the palestinian territories before heading to europe .
european leaders want washington to pressure israel to improve aid distribution to the gaza strip which has been hit hard by israeli blockades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton is building on president obama 's message of consulting and listening to america 's allies " we would like the israelis to go further , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on friday after a visit to the hamas-run gaza strip by europe 's top diplomat javier solana .
the united states is reportedly mulling a $ 900-million aid package to rebuild gaza but clinton said friday the aid would depend on how well the palestinians meet the conditions set by the diplomatic quartet consisting of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia .
with arab backing , the quartet has laid out three conditions that any palestinian partners in peace talks with israel must meet : renouncing violence , recognizing israel and abiding by previous agreements .
" i will be announcing a commitment to a significant aid package , but it will only be spent if we determine that our goals can be furthered rather than undermined or subverted , " clinton told voice of america radio ahead of her visit .
political uncertainty complicates task in middle east clinton is expected to face a tough task as she embarks on her first fact-finding mission to the middle east .
her visit comes at an awkward time in the region .
israeli elections earlier this month provided no clear-cut winner , leaving prime minister ehud olmert to preside over a caretaker government , while benjamin netanyahu , the leader of the conservative likud party , tries to form a ruling coalition . at the same time , palestinian president mahmoud abbas is still struggling to form a unity government , further dimming hope for any tangible progress on the tattered middle east peace process .
western-backed secular party fatah and its militant palestinian islamist rival hamas agreed thursday to work together to form a unity government to end factional feuding , but clinton said the egyptian-sponsored talks would only yield results if hamas agrees to abide by the quartet 's conditions .
" i believe that it 's important , if there is some reconciliation and a move toward a unified authority , that it 's very clear that hamas knows the conditions that have been set forth by the quartet , by the arab summit , " she said .
us deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs jeffrey feltman said on friday that clinton will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert , president shimon peres , diplomatic chief tzipi livni and opposition leader benjamin netanyahu . the peace process will be discussed during several bilateral meetings on the margins of the sharm el-sheikh conference , feltman said , adding that clinton would also meet egyptian president hosni mubarak .
clinton plans face-to-face meeting with lavrov on thursday in brussels , clinton is scheduled to meet her nato counterparts and join them at an informal dinner , along with swiss officials .
clinton will also meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov for the first time .
the meeting would use " the opportunity of a new american administration to capitalize on the many areas where the us and russia have common interests and can work in a common fashion , particularly on arms control , " fried said .

" there is an overarching theme to the trip to brussels which is the reconnection of the united states with europe and really a sense of consolidating this enormous political goodwill on both sides of the atlantic and harnessing it to a common agenda , " us assistant secretary of state for european affairs daniel fried said on friday .
the bush administration had a strained relationship with some european allies in the aftermath of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
but obama 's election was warmly welcomed in european capitals .
clinton at gaza donors ' conference clinton will begin her visit in the middle east on monday where she is to attend a donors ' conference aimed at rebuilding the gaza strip .
the conference will be held at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
she is also to visit israel and the palestinian territories before heading to europe .
european leaders want washington to pressure israel to improve aid distribution to the gaza strip which has been hit hard by israeli blockades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton is building on president obama 's message of consulting and listening to america 's allies " we would like the israelis to go further , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on friday after a visit to the hamas-run gaza strip by europe 's top diplomat javier solana .
the united states is reportedly mulling a $ 900-million aid package to rebuild gaza but clinton said friday the aid would depend on how well the palestinians meet the conditions set by the diplomatic quartet consisting of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia .
with arab backing , the quartet has laid out three conditions that any palestinian partners in peace talks with israel must meet : renouncing violence , recognizing israel and abiding by previous agreements .
" i will be announcing a commitment to a significant aid package , but it will only be spent if we determine that our goals can be furthered rather than undermined or subverted , " clinton told voice of america radio ahead of her visit .
political uncertainty complicates task in middle east clinton is expected to face a tough task as she embarks on her first fact-finding mission to the middle east .
her visit comes at an awkward time in the region .
israeli elections earlier this month provided no clear-cut winner , leaving prime minister ehud olmert to preside over a caretaker government , while benjamin netanyahu , the leader of the conservative likud party , tries to form a ruling coalition . at the same time , palestinian president mahmoud abbas is still struggling to form a unity government , further dimming hope for any tangible progress on the tattered middle east peace process .
western-backed secular party fatah and its militant palestinian islamist rival hamas agreed thursday to work together to form a unity government to end factional feuding , but clinton said the egyptian-sponsored talks would only yield results if hamas agrees to abide by the quartet 's conditions .
" i believe that it 's important , if there is some reconciliation and a move toward a unified authority , that it 's very clear that hamas knows the conditions that have been set forth by the quartet , by the arab summit , " she said .
us deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs jeffrey feltman said on friday that clinton will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert , president shimon peres , diplomatic chief tzipi livni and opposition leader benjamin netanyahu . the peace process will be discussed during several bilateral meetings on the margins of the sharm el-sheikh conference , feltman said , adding that clinton would also meet egyptian president hosni mubarak .
clinton plans face-to-face meeting with lavrov on thursday in brussels , clinton is scheduled to meet her nato counterparts and join them at an informal dinner , along with swiss officials .
clinton will also meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov for the first time .
the meeting would use " the opportunity of a new american administration to capitalize on the many areas where the us and russia have common interests and can work in a common fashion , particularly on arms control , " fried said .
clinton will wrap up her visit with a stop in turkey where she is to meet president abdullah gul , and foreign minister ali babacan . nda / sp / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's peter philipp thinks germany needs the freedom to choose . politicians and judges are taking the easy way out when they ban teachers from wearing headscarves .
the majority of female teachers are n't affected because they aren ’ t muslim .
and among their male colleagues in germany , there are hardly any religious jews who show up in the classroom wearing a hat or yarmulke .
this means that the law affects only those few muslim women in germany who so well-integrated that they have chosen to become teachers .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what are the government and the courts afraid of ?

but that can ’ t seriously be the case : if teachers were really doing that , then one could - in fact , one would have to - ban the practice .
just as christian teachers are n't allowed to evangelize at school .
the deciding factor in the hiring of a teacher should be her professional qualifications , and only her professional qualifications .
as the saying goes , it ’ s what ’ s inside the head that counts , not what ’ s on top of it .
by banning teachers from wearing headscarves , one sends an ominous signal : the children learn that there is something false or forbidden about wearing a headscarf .
in the future they will view headscarf-wearing muslim women , who they now encounter all across germany , from this perspective .
a ban would officially sanction isolation and discrimination .
under the pretence of wanting to curb radical tendencies , the government prohibits mature citizens from wearing a piece of clothing that they consider to be an indispensible attribute of their religion .
to protect women from being forced to wear a headscarf , one would have to follow the french example by banning female students from wearing headscarves at school .
a teachers , however , should be allowed to freely choose what she wants to wear .
or one could follow the example of the so-called crucifix judgment : the german federal constitutional court originally found that crucifixes could not be hung in the classroom if someone was offended by it .
but in practice , things have worked out differently : if anyone objects to the crucifix , they have alternatives .
similarly , anyone offended by a teacher wearing a headscarf could switch to another class .
the fact is that none of the headscarf lawsuits have involved offended parents .
they were always initiated by public officials or politicians .
and for them , the issue most certainly had to do with something other than the education of german school children .

dw 's felix steiber , however , says that schools must remain neutral and secular . when angela merkel became chancellor on nov .
22 , 2005 , she ended her oath of office with the words " so help me god . "
the chancellor presented herself as a faithful christian , but in doing so , she did not pose a challenge to german constitutional order - on the contrary .
she is allowed to exercise her office as a christian , but not for christians only or in a way that privileges this religious group .
this is the essential difference .
would all germans feel represented by her if she wore a headscarf ?
definitely not .
if she chose to publicly and visibly demonstrate her muslimhood , she would on a daily basis be stressing what spiritual - or , rather , religious - ground she stands on .
that can not and should not be the legacy of the european enlightenment in the 21st century .
secular and religious powers are separated .
territorial states are no longer headed by religious leaders , and no western head of state or government can demand from his or her citizens allegiance in religious matters .
the modern european state is pluralistic : its citizens can believe in whatever they like or nothing at all .
and that ’ s why when angela merkel goes to church on easter sunday , she goes as angela merkel and not as chancellor of the federal republic of germany .
civil servants are the public face and the symbolic image of the state .
if the state is ideologically neutral , then its direct employees , i.e. civil servants - which in germany includes teachers - must also be neutral .
i can ’ t choose which tax inspector will calculate my tax debt , which police officer will give me a ticket for my driving , or which teacher will educate my child , but i need to be able to rely on the fact that they will do these things from an ideologically neutral basis .
is that discrimination ?
absolutely not .
those who do not want to comply with this neutrality by giving up certain elements of their clothing can easily choose another career .
if i don ’ t want to be served by the headscarf-wearing saleslady at a bakery , i can look for an alternative by going to another bakery .
but there is no alternative to the state .
and that ’ s why i insist upon its independence .

an emeritus professor of ecumenical theology at the university of tuebingen in southern germany , kueng said he was " very sad " over the direction that the current church leadership was taking .
kueng , whose authority to teach catholic theology was rescinded by the vatican over his criticism of papal authority , said he was still optimistic after meeting pope benedict xvi four years ago . " i was hoping that he pope benedict would show himself as reforming , ecumenical and open for the future .
but this hope has been bitterly disappointed , " swiss-born kueng said .

" pope benedict xvi seriously angered many faithful catholics and suffered a severe loss of his credibility .
this is sad , " kueng said .
the pope should state that the revoking williamson 's excommunication without conditions has not been justified , kueng demanded .
kueng 's remarks have prompted fierce criticism by the vatican .

" there is an overarching theme to the trip to brussels which is the reconnection of the united states with europe and really a sense of consolidating this enormous political goodwill on both sides of the atlantic and harnessing it to a common agenda , " us assistant secretary of state for european affairs daniel fried said on friday .
the bush administration had a strained relationship with some european allies in the aftermath of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
but obama 's election was warmly welcomed in european capitals .
clinton at gaza donors ' conference clinton will begin her visit in the middle east on monday where she is to attend a donors ' conference aimed at rebuilding the gaza strip .
the conference will be held at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
she is also to visit israel and the palestinian territories before heading to europe .
european leaders want washington to pressure israel to improve aid distribution to the gaza strip which has been hit hard by israeli blockades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton is building on president obama 's message of consulting and listening to america 's allies " we would like the israelis to go further , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on friday after a visit to the hamas-run gaza strip by europe 's top diplomat javier solana .
the united states is reportedly mulling a $ 900-million aid package to rebuild gaza but clinton said friday the aid would depend on how well the palestinians meet the conditions set by the diplomatic quartet consisting of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia .
with arab backing , the quartet has laid out three conditions that any palestinian partners in peace talks with israel must meet : renouncing violence , recognizing israel and abiding by previous agreements .
" i will be announcing a commitment to a significant aid package , but it will only be spent if we determine that our goals can be furthered rather than undermined or subverted , " clinton told voice of america radio ahead of her visit .
political uncertainty complicates task in middle east clinton is expected to face a tough task as she embarks on her first fact-finding mission to the middle east .
her visit comes at an awkward time in the region .
israeli elections earlier this month provided no clear-cut winner , leaving prime minister ehud olmert to preside over a caretaker government , while benjamin netanyahu , the leader of the conservative likud party , tries to form a ruling coalition . at the same time , palestinian president mahmoud abbas is still struggling to form a unity government , further dimming hope for any tangible progress on the tattered middle east peace process .
western-backed secular party fatah and its militant palestinian islamist rival hamas agreed thursday to work together to form a unity government to end factional feuding , but clinton said the egyptian-sponsored talks would only yield results if hamas agrees to abide by the quartet 's conditions .
" i believe that it 's important , if there is some reconciliation and a move toward a unified authority , that it 's very clear that hamas knows the conditions that have been set forth by the quartet , by the arab summit , " she said .
us deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs jeffrey feltman said on friday that clinton will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert , president shimon peres , diplomatic chief tzipi livni and opposition leader benjamin netanyahu . the peace process will be discussed during several bilateral meetings on the margins of the sharm el-sheikh conference , feltman said , adding that clinton would also meet egyptian president hosni mubarak .
clinton plans face-to-face meeting with lavrov on thursday in brussels , clinton is scheduled to meet her nato counterparts and join them at an informal dinner , along with swiss officials .
clinton will also meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov for the first time .
the meeting would use " the opportunity of a new american administration to capitalize on the many areas where the us and russia have common interests and can work in a common fashion , particularly on arms control , " fried said .
clinton will wrap up her visit with a stop in turkey where she is to meet president abdullah gul , and foreign minister ali babacan . nda / sp / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with play concentrated up the other end of the field , maier decided to concentrate on the duck .
he slowly crawled towards it before theatrically diving to catch it .
needless to say he failed in his attempt to catch the animal , but achieved his goal of entertaining the fans .
such is the degree that maier is remembered for his theatrics both inside and outside the goalmouth , his birthday has been honored by the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , and the german government , which posted online articles commemorating the career and life of the man .
the dfb has proclaimed maier german goalkeeper of the century .

true to his word , maier will not celebrate his birthday quietly with family and friends in bavaria .
instead , he will be on stage in berlin , performing as a singer and magician in the show " das ueberraschungsfest der volksmusik , " the dfb said on its web site .
" it will be great .
there will be plenty of people to celebrate with me and i do n't have to pay , " maier told german news agency dpa .
" i have no interest in retiring .
if one retires you become even older , at least your spirit becomes older , " he said .
" if you have no plans in your life you might as well get buried immediately . "

two years earlier he helped west germany win the european championships .
with bayern he won five bundesliga titles , four german cups and three european champions trophies .
" those were the highlights of my life , " he said .
maier had 95 caps and played 473 bundesliga games for bayern munich , but in 1979 his career came to an abrupt end when he was badly injured in a car accident .
just short of a year ago , he said goodbye to his soccer life when he retired as bayern munich goalkeeping coach - around the same time his prodigy oliver kahn retired .

28 , but the former bayern munich shot stopper insists that wo n't slow him down nor push him any closer to actual retirement . maier will always be remembered for his efforts trying to catch a stray duck that wondered onto the field during a bundesliga match between bayern munich and vfl bochum in 1976 .
with play concentrated up the other end of the field , maier decided to concentrate on the duck .
he slowly crawled towards it before theatrically diving to catch it .
needless to say he failed in his attempt to catch the animal , but achieved his goal of entertaining the fans .
such is the degree that maier is remembered for his theatrics both inside and outside the goalmouth , his birthday has been honored by the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , and the german government , which posted online articles commemorating the career and life of the man .
the dfb has proclaimed maier german goalkeeper of the century .
no slowing down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer , left , and maier were instrumental in the world cup win although he is now at an age at which most people gratefully accept retirement , maier insists his years of dotage are still far off .
true to his word , maier will not celebrate his birthday quietly with family and friends in bavaria .
instead , he will be on stage in berlin , performing as a singer and magician in the show " das ueberraschungsfest der volksmusik , " the dfb said on its web site .
" it will be great .
there will be plenty of people to celebrate with me and i do n't have to pay , " maier told german news agency dpa .
" i have no interest in retiring .
if one retires you become even older , at least your spirit becomes older , " he said .
" if you have no plans in your life you might as well get buried immediately . "
celebrated keeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maier also helped west germany to a 1972 european championship maier was between the sticks for west germany when it hosted and won the 1974 world cup , playing alongside german soccer greats franz beckenbauer , berti vogts and gerd mueller .
two years earlier he helped west germany win the european championships .
with bayern he won five bundesliga titles , four german cups and three european champions trophies .
" those were the highlights of my life , " he said .
maier had 95 caps and played 473 bundesliga games for bayern munich , but in 1979 his career came to an abrupt end when he was badly injured in a car accident .
just short of a year ago , he said goodbye to his soccer life when he retired as bayern munich goalkeeping coach - around the same time his prodigy oliver kahn retired .
" i was with the club since i was 15 years old , but it had to be .
i ca n't be there until i am 100 , even though there is a tinge of sadness . " dfm / nda / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is an overarching theme to the trip to brussels which is the reconnection of the united states with europe and really a sense of consolidating this enormous political goodwill on both sides of the atlantic and harnessing it to a common agenda , " us assistant secretary of state for european affairs daniel fried said on friday .
the bush administration had a strained relationship with some european allies in the aftermath of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
but obama 's election was warmly welcomed in european capitals .
clinton at gaza donors ' conference clinton will begin her visit in the middle east on monday where she is to attend a donors ' conference aimed at rebuilding the gaza strip .
the conference will be held at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
she is also to visit israel and the palestinian territories before heading to europe .
european leaders want washington to pressure israel to improve aid distribution to the gaza strip which has been hit hard by israeli blockades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton is building on president obama 's message of consulting and listening to america 's allies " we would like the israelis to go further , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on friday after a visit to the hamas-run gaza strip by europe 's top diplomat javier solana .
the united states is reportedly mulling a $ 900-million aid package to rebuild gaza but clinton said friday the aid would depend on how well the palestinians meet the conditions set by the diplomatic quartet consisting of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia .
with arab backing , the quartet has laid out three conditions that any palestinian partners in peace talks with israel must meet : renouncing violence , recognizing israel and abiding by previous agreements .
" i will be announcing a commitment to a significant aid package , but it will only be spent if we determine that our goals can be furthered rather than undermined or subverted , " clinton told voice of america radio ahead of her visit .
political uncertainty complicates task in middle east clinton is expected to face a tough task as she embarks on her first fact-finding mission to the middle east .
her visit comes at an awkward time in the region .
israeli elections earlier this month provided no clear-cut winner , leaving prime minister ehud olmert to preside over a caretaker government , while benjamin netanyahu , the leader of the conservative likud party , tries to form a ruling coalition . at the same time , palestinian president mahmoud abbas is still struggling to form a unity government , further dimming hope for any tangible progress on the tattered middle east peace process .
western-backed secular party fatah and its militant palestinian islamist rival hamas agreed thursday to work together to form a unity government to end factional feuding , but clinton said the egyptian-sponsored talks would only yield results if hamas agrees to abide by the quartet 's conditions .
" i believe that it 's important , if there is some reconciliation and a move toward a unified authority , that it 's very clear that hamas knows the conditions that have been set forth by the quartet , by the arab summit , " she said .
us deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs jeffrey feltman said on friday that clinton will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert , president shimon peres , diplomatic chief tzipi livni and opposition leader benjamin netanyahu . the peace process will be discussed during several bilateral meetings on the margins of the sharm el-sheikh conference , feltman said , adding that clinton would also meet egyptian president hosni mubarak .
clinton plans face-to-face meeting with lavrov on thursday in brussels , clinton is scheduled to meet her nato counterparts and join them at an informal dinner , along with swiss officials .
clinton will also meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov for the first time .
the meeting would use " the opportunity of a new american administration to capitalize on the many areas where the us and russia have common interests and can work in a common fashion , particularly on arms control , " fried said .

" we do not want any new dividing lines ; we do not want a europe divided along a north-south or an east-west line ; pursuing a beggar-thy-neighbor policy is unacceptable , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is to chair the meeting as current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the eve of the summit . the informal meeting of the leaders of the eu 's 27 member states is officially set to discuss the bloc 's response to the deepening economic crisis .
it is the fourth full summit to focus on that subject since october . but the summit 's preparations were marred by a bitter row between the czech republic and france - the previous holder of the presidency - after french president nicolas sarkozy criticized french car makers who had shifted production to central europe and said french auto companies should give priority to french workers . protectionist policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek wants europe to act together the czech republic , which has become a major production center for the automotive industry and has seen sizeable investments from french car firms , attacked those demands as protectionist . prague responded by saying that sunday 's summit should focus on rejecting protectionism .
sarkozy said that it should rather aim at reviving the market for inter-bank lending , seen as a key to ending the ongoing financial crisis . diplomatic sources told the dpa news agency that sarkozy and topolanek were to meet in private immediately before sunday 's meeting in a bid to resolve their differences . on saturday , the european commission , the eu 's executive , said that france had dropped plans to fund the country 's car makers on condition that they give preferential treatment to french plants and suppliers , in a move seen as likely to ease tensions . " in particular , the loan agreements with manufacturers would not contain any condition regarding either the location of their activities or a preference for france-based suppliers , " a commission statement said . european cliques trouble also flared ahead of the summit after germany hosted a meeting of the european members of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies - britain , france , germany and italy - on february 22 . spain and the netherlands were also invited to the meeting , which was meant to pave the way for a g20 summit in london on april 2 . but the inclusion of the two non-members infuriated countries such as poland , finland and sweden , who saw it as a snub and warned that such actions risked breaking the eu up into cliques . on sunday morning , poland is to host in brussels a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's nine members from central and eastern europe . diplomats from the countries involved say the meeting is routine . germany takes lead in calling for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mergel is calling for urgent action german chancellor merkel urged the eu states to work together to tackle the global economic downturn . " we should keep in mind that the economic crisis emerged out of a massive financial crisis , " merkel told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the european union must work together on making sure that something like that does n't happen again , and we need to act urgently . " with germany , europe 's biggest economy , facing its worst recession since world war ii , merkel has long called for greater oversight of financial markets , increased transparency and tougher regulations for hedge funds , rating agencies and corporate bonus structures . " we need a global financial architecture that is transparent , " merkel said .

it is the fourth full summit to focus on that subject since october . but the summit 's preparations were marred by a bitter row between the czech republic and france - the previous holder of the presidency - after french president nicolas sarkozy criticized french car makers who had shifted production to central europe and said french auto companies should give priority to french workers . protectionist policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek wants europe to act together the czech republic , which has become a major production center for the automotive industry and has seen sizeable investments from french car firms , attacked those demands as protectionist . prague responded by saying that sunday 's summit should focus on rejecting protectionism .
sarkozy said that it should rather aim at reviving the market for inter-bank lending , seen as a key to ending the ongoing financial crisis . diplomatic sources told the dpa news agency that sarkozy and topolanek were to meet in private immediately before sunday 's meeting in a bid to resolve their differences . on saturday , the european commission , the eu 's executive , said that france had dropped plans to fund the country 's car makers on condition that they give preferential treatment to french plants and suppliers , in a move seen as likely to ease tensions . " in particular , the loan agreements with manufacturers would not contain any condition regarding either the location of their activities or a preference for france-based suppliers , " a commission statement said . european cliques trouble also flared ahead of the summit after germany hosted a meeting of the european members of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies - britain , france , germany and italy - on february 22 . spain and the netherlands were also invited to the meeting , which was meant to pave the way for a g20 summit in london on april 2 . but the inclusion of the two non-members infuriated countries such as poland , finland and sweden , who saw it as a snub and warned that such actions risked breaking the eu up into cliques . on sunday morning , poland is to host in brussels a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's nine members from central and eastern europe . diplomats from the countries involved say the meeting is routine . germany takes lead in calling for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mergel is calling for urgent action german chancellor merkel urged the eu states to work together to tackle the global economic downturn .

opel could be lined up for temporary state aid the german government is debating whether to help ailing carmaker opel after us parent company general motors said it planned to spin off its german arm which needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . german chancellor angela merkel on saturday , feb 28 , reacted cautiously to calls for her government to prop up stricken automaker opel .
speaking at a meeting of her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the northern city of kiel , merkel said her government would need to carefully examine an opel rescue plan outlined by us parent company general motors before a decision on a bail-out could be taken .
the chancellor , whose government has passed a major bailout package for banks and two economic stimulus plans worth billions , said there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
it needs to be ascertained whether a company 's troubles are triggered by the global financial crisis and whether it can continue to operate strongly in the long-term , the chancellor said .
earlier , german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg discussed opel 's future with the premiers of the four states where opel plants are located .
the talks served to " explore various plans of action , " according to the minister .
he added that the discussion would intensify once opel revealed exact details of its rescue plan .
opel needs billions to survive on friday , the head of gm europe , carl-peter forster , said opel needed 3.3 billion euros in aid to survive and to aviod job cuts and closures .
he also said the german carmaker would be split off into a seperate unit .
speaking at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim , forster said general motors europe would present the rescue plan to german authorities on monday .
he added that the plan it included 3.0 billion euros from gm itself along with around one billion euros in cost savings .
" we need all three parts of the plan " to ensure its success , forster said .
he added that opel would repay any state aid by 2014-2015 , but said that " as a result of the automobile market crisis we are now in a very tough situation . "

" but it is a fact that we find ourselves in an exceptional economic situation and that we will eventually have to consider closing sites , " he said .
press reports have said that an opel factory in the western city of bochum is threatened and that another in eastern eisenach might be sold .
opel itself must remain a part of gm , though its capital could be opened up to third parties or partnerships could be created , forster said .
the rescue plan was required by german authorities before any public aid would be granted to opel , which has been hit by a global auto slump and massive financial problems at gm .
gm europe works committee chief klaus franz told media that opel should be transformed into a european company , or sa , which would allow the participation of outside investors .

opel could be lined up for temporary state aid the german government is debating whether to help ailing carmaker opel after us parent company general motors said it planned to spin off its german arm which needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . german chancellor angela merkel on saturday , feb 28 , reacted cautiously to calls for her government to prop up stricken automaker opel .
speaking at a meeting of her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the northern city of kiel , merkel said her government would need to carefully examine an opel rescue plan outlined by us parent company general motors before a decision on a bail-out could be taken .
the chancellor , whose government has passed a major bailout package for banks and two economic stimulus plans worth billions , said there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
it needs to be ascertained whether a company 's troubles are triggered by the global financial crisis and whether it can continue to operate strongly in the long-term , the chancellor said .
earlier , german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg discussed opel 's future with the premiers of the four states where opel plants are located .
the talks served to " explore various plans of action , " according to the minister .
he added that the discussion would intensify once opel revealed exact details of its rescue plan .
opel needs billions to survive on friday , the head of gm europe , carl-peter forster , said opel needed 3.3 billion euros in aid to survive and to aviod job cuts and closures .
he also said the german carmaker would be split off into a seperate unit .
speaking at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim , forster said general motors europe would present the rescue plan to german authorities on monday .
he added that the plan it included 3.0 billion euros from gm itself along with around one billion euros in cost savings .
" we need all three parts of the plan " to ensure its success , forster said .
he added that opel would repay any state aid by 2014-2015 , but said that " as a result of the automobile market crisis we are now in a very tough situation . "
opel looking to break from gm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could break from gm after 80 years of marriage opel 's activities would be regrouped within an independent unit as part of the plan , forster said , adding that no decisions had been taken yet regarding possible plant closures .
" but it is a fact that we find ourselves in an exceptional economic situation and that we will eventually have to consider closing sites , " he said .
press reports have said that an opel factory in the western city of bochum is threatened and that another in eastern eisenach might be sold .
opel itself must remain a part of gm , though its capital could be opened up to third parties or partnerships could be created , forster said .
the rescue plan was required by german authorities before any public aid would be granted to opel , which has been hit by a global auto slump and massive financial problems at gm .
gm europe works committee chief klaus franz told media that opel should be transformed into a european company , or sa , which would allow the participation of outside investors .
" after 80 years , gm is prepared to cede parts of opel , " franz said .
he called the management 's plan " very viable " and said it had been approved by workers ' representatives .

meanwhile , other reports said opel and german car manufacturer daimler , maker of mercedes-benz autos , were in negotiations over the possible sale of one of opel 's factories .
opel 's plant in the central city of eisenach might could go to the luxury car maker , resulting in the construction of a new mercedes factory in hungary " possibly being abandoned , " the thueringer allgemeine newspaper said .

" we do not want any new dividing lines ; we do not want a europe divided along a north-south or an east-west line ; pursuing a beggar-thy-neighbor policy is unacceptable , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is to chair the meeting as current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the eve of the summit . the informal meeting of the leaders of the eu 's 27 member states is officially set to discuss the bloc 's response to the deepening economic crisis .
it is the fourth full summit to focus on that subject since october . but the summit 's preparations were marred by a bitter row between the czech republic and france - the previous holder of the presidency - after french president nicolas sarkozy criticized french car makers who had shifted production to central europe and said french auto companies should give priority to french workers . protectionist policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek wants europe to act together the czech republic , which has become a major production center for the automotive industry and has seen sizeable investments from french car firms , attacked those demands as protectionist . prague responded by saying that sunday 's summit should focus on rejecting protectionism .
sarkozy said that it should rather aim at reviving the market for inter-bank lending , seen as a key to ending the ongoing financial crisis . diplomatic sources told the dpa news agency that sarkozy and topolanek were to meet in private immediately before sunday 's meeting in a bid to resolve their differences . on saturday , the european commission , the eu 's executive , said that france had dropped plans to fund the country 's car makers on condition that they give preferential treatment to french plants and suppliers , in a move seen as likely to ease tensions . " in particular , the loan agreements with manufacturers would not contain any condition regarding either the location of their activities or a preference for france-based suppliers , " a commission statement said . european cliques trouble also flared ahead of the summit after germany hosted a meeting of the european members of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies - britain , france , germany and italy - on february 22 . spain and the netherlands were also invited to the meeting , which was meant to pave the way for a g20 summit in london on april 2 . but the inclusion of the two non-members infuriated countries such as poland , finland and sweden , who saw it as a snub and warned that such actions risked breaking the eu up into cliques . on sunday morning , poland is to host in brussels a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's nine members from central and eastern europe . diplomats from the countries involved say the meeting is routine . germany takes lead in calling for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mergel is calling for urgent action german chancellor merkel urged the eu states to work together to tackle the global economic downturn . " we should keep in mind that the economic crisis emerged out of a massive financial crisis , " merkel told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .

" there is an overarching theme to the trip to brussels which is the reconnection of the united states with europe and really a sense of consolidating this enormous political goodwill on both sides of the atlantic and harnessing it to a common agenda , " us assistant secretary of state for european affairs daniel fried said on friday .

clinton at gaza donors ' conference clinton will begin her visit in the middle east on monday where she is to attend a donors ' conference aimed at rebuilding the gaza strip .
the conference will be held at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
she is also to visit israel and the palestinian territories before heading to europe .
european leaders want washington to pressure israel to improve aid distribution to the gaza strip which has been hit hard by israeli blockades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton is building on president obama 's message of consulting and listening to america 's allies " we would like the israelis to go further , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on friday after a visit to the hamas-run gaza strip by europe 's top diplomat javier solana .
the united states is reportedly mulling a $ 900-million aid package to rebuild gaza but clinton said friday the aid would depend on how well the palestinians meet the conditions set by the diplomatic quartet consisting of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia .
with arab backing , the quartet has laid out three conditions that any palestinian partners in peace talks with israel must meet : renouncing violence , recognizing israel and abiding by previous agreements .
" i will be announcing a commitment to a significant aid package , but it will only be spent if we determine that our goals can be furthered rather than undermined or subverted , " clinton told voice of america radio ahead of her visit .
political uncertainty complicates task in middle east clinton is expected to face a tough task as she embarks on her first fact-finding mission to the middle east .
her visit comes at an awkward time in the region .
israeli elections earlier this month provided no clear-cut winner , leaving prime minister ehud olmert to preside over a caretaker government , while benjamin netanyahu , the leader of the conservative likud party , tries to form a ruling coalition . at the same time , palestinian president mahmoud abbas is still struggling to form a unity government , further dimming hope for any tangible progress on the tattered middle east peace process .
western-backed secular party fatah and its militant palestinian islamist rival hamas agreed thursday to work together to form a unity government to end factional feuding , but clinton said the egyptian-sponsored talks would only yield results if hamas agrees to abide by the quartet 's conditions .
" i believe that it 's important , if there is some reconciliation and a move toward a unified authority , that it 's very clear that hamas knows the conditions that have been set forth by the quartet , by the arab summit , " she said .
us deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs jeffrey feltman said on friday that clinton will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert , president shimon peres , diplomatic chief tzipi livni and opposition leader benjamin netanyahu . the peace process will be discussed during several bilateral meetings on the margins of the sharm el-sheikh conference , feltman said , adding that clinton would also meet egyptian president hosni mubarak .
clinton plans face-to-face meeting with lavrov on thursday in brussels , clinton is scheduled to meet her nato counterparts and join them at an informal dinner , along with swiss officials .
clinton will also meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov for the first time .
the meeting would use " the opportunity of a new american administration to capitalize on the many areas where the us and russia have common interests and can work in a common fashion , particularly on arms control , " fried said .

" there is an overarching theme to the trip to brussels which is the reconnection of the united states with europe and really a sense of consolidating this enormous political goodwill on both sides of the atlantic and harnessing it to a common agenda , " us assistant secretary of state for european affairs daniel fried said on friday .
the bush administration had a strained relationship with some european allies in the aftermath of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
but obama 's election was warmly welcomed in european capitals .
clinton at gaza donors ' conference clinton will begin her visit in the middle east on monday where she is to attend a donors ' conference aimed at rebuilding the gaza strip .
the conference will be held at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
she is also to visit israel and the palestinian territories before heading to europe .
european leaders want washington to pressure israel to improve aid distribution to the gaza strip which has been hit hard by israeli blockades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton is building on president obama 's message of consulting and listening to america 's allies " we would like the israelis to go further , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on friday after a visit to the hamas-run gaza strip by europe 's top diplomat javier solana .
the united states is reportedly mulling a $ 900-million aid package to rebuild gaza but clinton said friday the aid would depend on how well the palestinians meet the conditions set by the diplomatic quartet consisting of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia .
with arab backing , the quartet has laid out three conditions that any palestinian partners in peace talks with israel must meet : renouncing violence , recognizing israel and abiding by previous agreements .
" i will be announcing a commitment to a significant aid package , but it will only be spent if we determine that our goals can be furthered rather than undermined or subverted , " clinton told voice of america radio ahead of her visit .
political uncertainty complicates task in middle east clinton is expected to face a tough task as she embarks on her first fact-finding mission to the middle east .
her visit comes at an awkward time in the region .
israeli elections earlier this month provided no clear-cut winner , leaving prime minister ehud olmert to preside over a caretaker government , while benjamin netanyahu , the leader of the conservative likud party , tries to form a ruling coalition . at the same time , palestinian president mahmoud abbas is still struggling to form a unity government , further dimming hope for any tangible progress on the tattered middle east peace process .
western-backed secular party fatah and its militant palestinian islamist rival hamas agreed thursday to work together to form a unity government to end factional feuding , but clinton said the egyptian-sponsored talks would only yield results if hamas agrees to abide by the quartet 's conditions .
" i believe that it 's important , if there is some reconciliation and a move toward a unified authority , that it 's very clear that hamas knows the conditions that have been set forth by the quartet , by the arab summit , " she said .
us deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs jeffrey feltman said on friday that clinton will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert , president shimon peres , diplomatic chief tzipi livni and opposition leader benjamin netanyahu . the peace process will be discussed during several bilateral meetings on the margins of the sharm el-sheikh conference , feltman said , adding that clinton would also meet egyptian president hosni mubarak .
clinton plans face-to-face meeting with lavrov on thursday in brussels , clinton is scheduled to meet her nato counterparts and join them at an informal dinner , along with swiss officials .
clinton will also meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov for the first time .
the meeting would use " the opportunity of a new american administration to capitalize on the many areas where the us and russia have common interests and can work in a common fashion , particularly on arms control , " fried said .
clinton will wrap up her visit with a stop in turkey where she is to meet president abdullah gul , and foreign minister ali babacan . nda / sp / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's peter philipp thinks germany needs the freedom to choose . politicians and judges are taking the easy way out when they ban teachers from wearing headscarves .
the majority of female teachers are n't affected because they aren ’ t muslim .
and among their male colleagues in germany , there are hardly any religious jews who show up in the classroom wearing a hat or yarmulke .
this means that the law affects only those few muslim women in germany who so well-integrated that they have chosen to become teachers .
they are ready to be a part of this society and yet do not want to have to give up their religion and its public symbols .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what are the government and the courts afraid of ?
that muslim elementary school teachers will convert little hans or fritz to their religion ?
but that can ’ t seriously be the case : if teachers were really doing that , then one could - in fact , one would have to - ban the practice .
just as christian teachers are n't allowed to evangelize at school .
the deciding factor in the hiring of a teacher should be her professional qualifications , and only her professional qualifications .
as the saying goes , it ’ s what ’ s inside the head that counts , not what ’ s on top of it .
by banning teachers from wearing headscarves , one sends an ominous signal : the children learn that there is something false or forbidden about wearing a headscarf .
in the future they will view headscarf-wearing muslim women , who they now encounter all across germany , from this perspective .
a ban would officially sanction isolation and discrimination .
under the pretence of wanting to curb radical tendencies , the government prohibits mature citizens from wearing a piece of clothing that they consider to be an indispensible attribute of their religion .
to protect women from being forced to wear a headscarf , one would have to follow the french example by banning female students from wearing headscarves at school .
a teachers , however , should be allowed to freely choose what she wants to wear .
or one could follow the example of the so-called crucifix judgment : the german federal constitutional court originally found that crucifixes could not be hung in the classroom if someone was offended by it .
but in practice , things have worked out differently : if anyone objects to the crucifix , they have alternatives .
similarly , anyone offended by a teacher wearing a headscarf could switch to another class .
the fact is that none of the headscarf lawsuits have involved offended parents .
they were always initiated by public officials or politicians .
and for them , the issue most certainly had to do with something other than the education of german school children .

dw 's felix steiber , however , says that schools must remain neutral and secular . when angela merkel became chancellor on nov .
22 , 2005 , she ended her oath of office with the words " so help me god . "
the chancellor presented herself as a faithful christian , but in doing so , she did not pose a challenge to german constitutional order - on the contrary .
she is allowed to exercise her office as a christian , but not for christians only or in a way that privileges this religious group .
this is the essential difference .
would all germans feel represented by her if she wore a headscarf ?
definitely not .
if she chose to publicly and visibly demonstrate her muslimhood , she would on a daily basis be stressing what spiritual - or , rather , religious - ground she stands on .
that can not and should not be the legacy of the european enlightenment in the 21st century .
secular and religious powers are separated .
territorial states are no longer headed by religious leaders , and no western head of state or government can demand from his or her citizens allegiance in religious matters .
the modern european state is pluralistic : its citizens can believe in whatever they like or nothing at all .
and that ’ s why when angela merkel goes to church on easter sunday , she goes as angela merkel and not as chancellor of the federal republic of germany .
civil servants are the public face and the symbolic image of the state .
if the state is ideologically neutral , then its direct employees , i.e. civil servants - which in germany includes teachers - must also be neutral .
i can ’ t choose which tax inspector will calculate my tax debt , which police officer will give me a ticket for my driving , or which teacher will educate my child , but i need to be able to rely on the fact that they will do these things from an ideologically neutral basis .
is that discrimination ?
absolutely not .
those who do not want to comply with this neutrality by giving up certain elements of their clothing can easily choose another career .
if i don ’ t want to be served by the headscarf-wearing saleslady at a bakery , i can look for an alternative by going to another bakery .
but there is no alternative to the state .

" we do not want any new dividing lines ; we do not want a europe divided along a north-south or an east-west line ; pursuing a beggar-thy-neighbor policy is unacceptable , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is to chair the meeting as current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the eve of the summit . the informal meeting of the leaders of the eu 's 27 member states is officially set to discuss the bloc 's response to the deepening economic crisis .
it is the fourth full summit to focus on that subject since october . but the summit 's preparations were marred by a bitter row between the czech republic and france - the previous holder of the presidency - after french president nicolas sarkozy criticized french car makers who had shifted production to central europe and said french auto companies should give priority to french workers . protectionist policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek wants europe to act together the czech republic , which has become a major production center for the automotive industry and has seen sizeable investments from french car firms , attacked those demands as protectionist . prague responded by saying that sunday 's summit should focus on rejecting protectionism .
sarkozy said that it should rather aim at reviving the market for inter-bank lending , seen as a key to ending the ongoing financial crisis . diplomatic sources told the dpa news agency that sarkozy and topolanek were to meet in private immediately before sunday 's meeting in a bid to resolve their differences . on saturday , the european commission , the eu 's executive , said that france had dropped plans to fund the country 's car makers on condition that they give preferential treatment to french plants and suppliers , in a move seen as likely to ease tensions . " in particular , the loan agreements with manufacturers would not contain any condition regarding either the location of their activities or a preference for france-based suppliers , " a commission statement said . european cliques trouble also flared ahead of the summit after germany hosted a meeting of the european members of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies - britain , france , germany and italy - on february 22 . spain and the netherlands were also invited to the meeting , which was meant to pave the way for a g20 summit in london on april 2 . but the inclusion of the two non-members infuriated countries such as poland , finland and sweden , who saw it as a snub and warned that such actions risked breaking the eu up into cliques . on sunday morning , poland is to host in brussels a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's nine members from central and eastern europe . diplomats from the countries involved say the meeting is routine . germany takes lead in calling for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mergel is calling for urgent action german chancellor merkel urged the eu states to work together to tackle the global economic downturn . " we should keep in mind that the economic crisis emerged out of a massive financial crisis , " merkel told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the european union must work together on making sure that something like that does n't happen again , and we need to act urgently . " with germany , europe 's biggest economy , facing its worst recession since world war ii , merkel has long called for greater oversight of financial markets , increased transparency and tougher regulations for hedge funds , rating agencies and corporate bonus structures . " we need a global financial architecture that is transparent , " merkel said .

" we do not want any new dividing lines ; we do not want a europe divided along a north-south or an east-west line ; pursuing a beggar-thy-neighbor policy is unacceptable , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is to chair the meeting as current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the eve of the summit . the informal meeting of the leaders of the eu 's 27 member states is officially set to discuss the bloc 's response to the deepening economic crisis .
it is the fourth full summit to focus on that subject since october . but the summit 's preparations were marred by a bitter row between the czech republic and france - the previous holder of the presidency - after french president nicolas sarkozy criticized french car makers who had shifted production to central europe and said french auto companies should give priority to french workers . protectionist policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek wants europe to act together the czech republic , which has become a major production center for the automotive industry and has seen sizeable investments from french car firms , attacked those demands as protectionist . prague responded by saying that sunday 's summit should focus on rejecting protectionism .
sarkozy said that it should rather aim at reviving the market for inter-bank lending , seen as a key to ending the ongoing financial crisis . diplomatic sources told the dpa news agency that sarkozy and topolanek were to meet in private immediately before sunday 's meeting in a bid to resolve their differences . on saturday , the european commission , the eu 's executive , said that france had dropped plans to fund the country 's car makers on condition that they give preferential treatment to french plants and suppliers , in a move seen as likely to ease tensions . " in particular , the loan agreements with manufacturers would not contain any condition regarding either the location of their activities or a preference for france-based suppliers , " a commission statement said . european cliques trouble also flared ahead of the summit after germany hosted a meeting of the european members of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies - britain , france , germany and italy - on february 22 . spain and the netherlands were also invited to the meeting , which was meant to pave the way for a g20 summit in london on april 2 . but the inclusion of the two non-members infuriated countries such as poland , finland and sweden , who saw it as a snub and warned that such actions risked breaking the eu up into cliques . on sunday morning , poland is to host in brussels a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's nine members from central and eastern europe . diplomats from the countries involved say the meeting is routine . germany takes lead in calling for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mergel is calling for urgent action german chancellor merkel urged the eu states to work together to tackle the global economic downturn . " we should keep in mind that the economic crisis emerged out of a massive financial crisis , " merkel told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the european union must work together on making sure that something like that does n't happen again , and we need to act urgently . " with germany , europe 's biggest economy , facing its worst recession since world war ii , merkel has long called for greater oversight of financial markets , increased transparency and tougher regulations for hedge funds , rating agencies and corporate bonus structures . " we need a global financial architecture that is transparent , " merkel said .

" there is an overarching theme to the trip to brussels which is the reconnection of the united states with europe and really a sense of consolidating this enormous political goodwill on both sides of the atlantic and harnessing it to a common agenda , " us assistant secretary of state for european affairs daniel fried said on friday .
the bush administration had a strained relationship with some european allies in the aftermath of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
but obama 's election was warmly welcomed in european capitals .
clinton at gaza donors ' conference clinton will begin her visit in the middle east on monday where she is to attend a donors ' conference aimed at rebuilding the gaza strip .
the conference will be held at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
she is also to visit israel and the palestinian territories before heading to europe .
european leaders want washington to pressure israel to improve aid distribution to the gaza strip which has been hit hard by israeli blockades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton is building on president obama 's message of consulting and listening to america 's allies " we would like the israelis to go further , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on friday after a visit to the hamas-run gaza strip by europe 's top diplomat javier solana .
the united states is reportedly mulling a $ 900-million aid package to rebuild gaza but clinton said friday the aid would depend on how well the palestinians meet the conditions set by the diplomatic quartet consisting of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia .
with arab backing , the quartet has laid out three conditions that any palestinian partners in peace talks with israel must meet : renouncing violence , recognizing israel and abiding by previous agreements .
" i will be announcing a commitment to a significant aid package , but it will only be spent if we determine that our goals can be furthered rather than undermined or subverted , " clinton told voice of america radio ahead of her visit .
political uncertainty complicates task in middle east clinton is expected to face a tough task as she embarks on her first fact-finding mission to the middle east .
her visit comes at an awkward time in the region .
israeli elections earlier this month provided no clear-cut winner , leaving prime minister ehud olmert to preside over a caretaker government , while benjamin netanyahu , the leader of the conservative likud party , tries to form a ruling coalition . at the same time , palestinian president mahmoud abbas is still struggling to form a unity government , further dimming hope for any tangible progress on the tattered middle east peace process .
western-backed secular party fatah and its militant palestinian islamist rival hamas agreed thursday to work together to form a unity government to end factional feuding , but clinton said the egyptian-sponsored talks would only yield results if hamas agrees to abide by the quartet 's conditions .
" i believe that it 's important , if there is some reconciliation and a move toward a unified authority , that it 's very clear that hamas knows the conditions that have been set forth by the quartet , by the arab summit , " she said .
us deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs jeffrey feltman said on friday that clinton will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert , president shimon peres , diplomatic chief tzipi livni and opposition leader benjamin netanyahu . the peace process will be discussed during several bilateral meetings on the margins of the sharm el-sheikh conference , feltman said , adding that clinton would also meet egyptian president hosni mubarak .
clinton plans face-to-face meeting with lavrov on thursday in brussels , clinton is scheduled to meet her nato counterparts and join them at an informal dinner , along with swiss officials .
clinton will also meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov for the first time .
the meeting would use " the opportunity of a new american administration to capitalize on the many areas where the us and russia have common interests and can work in a common fashion , particularly on arms control , " fried said .
clinton will wrap up her visit with a stop in turkey where she is to meet president abdullah gul , and foreign minister ali babacan . nda / sp / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's felix steiber , however , says that schools must remain neutral and secular . when angela merkel became chancellor on nov .
22 , 2005 , she ended her oath of office with the words " so help me god . "
the chancellor presented herself as a faithful christian , but in doing so , she did not pose a challenge to german constitutional order - on the contrary .
she is allowed to exercise her office as a christian , but not for christians only or in a way that privileges this religious group .
this is the essential difference .
would all germans feel represented by her if she wore a headscarf ?
definitely not .
if she chose to publicly and visibly demonstrate her muslimhood , she would on a daily basis be stressing what spiritual - or , rather , religious - ground she stands on .
that can not and should not be the legacy of the european enlightenment in the 21st century .
secular and religious powers are separated .
territorial states are no longer headed by religious leaders , and no western head of state or government can demand from his or her citizens allegiance in religious matters .
the modern european state is pluralistic : its citizens can believe in whatever they like or nothing at all .
and that ’ s why when angela merkel goes to church on easter sunday , she goes as angela merkel and not as chancellor of the federal republic of germany .
civil servants are the public face and the symbolic image of the state .
if the state is ideologically neutral , then its direct employees , i.e. civil servants - which in germany includes teachers - must also be neutral .
i can ’ t choose which tax inspector will calculate my tax debt , which police officer will give me a ticket for my driving , or which teacher will educate my child , but i need to be able to rely on the fact that they will do these things from an ideologically neutral basis .
is that discrimination ?
absolutely not .
those who do not want to comply with this neutrality by giving up certain elements of their clothing can easily choose another career .
if i don ’ t want to be served by the headscarf-wearing saleslady at a bakery , i can look for an alternative by going to another bakery .
but there is no alternative to the state .
and that ’ s why i insist upon its independence .

" we do not want any new dividing lines ; we do not want a europe divided along a north-south or an east-west line ; pursuing a beggar-thy-neighbor policy is unacceptable , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is to chair the meeting as current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the eve of the summit . the informal meeting of the leaders of the eu 's 27 member states is officially set to discuss the bloc 's response to the deepening economic crisis .
it is the fourth full summit to focus on that subject since october . but the summit 's preparations were marred by a bitter row between the czech republic and france - the previous holder of the presidency - after french president nicolas sarkozy criticized french car makers who had shifted production to central europe and said french auto companies should give priority to french workers . protectionist policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek wants europe to act together the czech republic , which has become a major production center for the automotive industry and has seen sizeable investments from french car firms , attacked those demands as protectionist . prague responded by saying that sunday 's summit should focus on rejecting protectionism .

opel could be lined up for temporary state aid the german government is debating whether to help ailing carmaker opel after us parent company general motors said it planned to spin off its german arm which needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . german chancellor angela merkel on saturday , feb 28 , reacted cautiously to calls for her government to prop up stricken automaker opel .
speaking at a meeting of her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the northern city of kiel , merkel said her government would need to carefully examine an opel rescue plan outlined by us parent company general motors before a decision on a bail-out could be taken .
the chancellor , whose government has passed a major bailout package for banks and two economic stimulus plans worth billions , said there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
it needs to be ascertained whether a company 's troubles are triggered by the global financial crisis and whether it can continue to operate strongly in the long-term , the chancellor said .
earlier , german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg discussed opel 's future with the premiers of the four states where opel plants are located .
the talks served to " explore various plans of action , " according to the minister .
he added that the discussion would intensify once opel revealed exact details of its rescue plan .
opel needs billions to survive on friday , the head of gm europe , carl-peter forster , said opel needed 3.3 billion euros in aid to survive and to aviod job cuts and closures .
he also said the german carmaker would be split off into a seperate unit .
speaking at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim , forster said general motors europe would present the rescue plan to german authorities on monday .
he added that the plan it included 3.0 billion euros from gm itself along with around one billion euros in cost savings .
" we need all three parts of the plan " to ensure its success , forster said .
he added that opel would repay any state aid by 2014-2015 , but said that " as a result of the automobile market crisis we are now in a very tough situation . "
opel looking to break from gm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could break from gm after 80 years of marriage opel 's activities would be regrouped within an independent unit as part of the plan , forster said , adding that no decisions had been taken yet regarding possible plant closures .
" but it is a fact that we find ourselves in an exceptional economic situation and that we will eventually have to consider closing sites , " he said .
press reports have said that an opel factory in the western city of bochum is threatened and that another in eastern eisenach might be sold .
opel itself must remain a part of gm , though its capital could be opened up to third parties or partnerships could be created , forster said .
the rescue plan was required by german authorities before any public aid would be granted to opel , which has been hit by a global auto slump and massive financial problems at gm .
gm europe works committee chief klaus franz told media that opel should be transformed into a european company , or sa , which would allow the participation of outside investors .
" after 80 years , gm is prepared to cede parts of opel , " franz said .
he called the management 's plan " very viable " and said it had been approved by workers ' representatives .

opel 's plant in the central city of eisenach might could go to the luxury car maker , resulting in the construction of a new mercedes factory in hungary " possibly being abandoned , " the thueringer allgemeine newspaper said .

opel could be lined up for temporary state aid the german government is debating whether to help ailing carmaker opel after us parent company general motors said it planned to spin off its german arm which needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . german chancellor angela merkel on saturday , feb 28 , reacted cautiously to calls for her government to prop up stricken automaker opel .
speaking at a meeting of her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the northern city of kiel , merkel said her government would need to carefully examine an opel rescue plan outlined by us parent company general motors before a decision on a bail-out could be taken .
the chancellor , whose government has passed a major bailout package for banks and two economic stimulus plans worth billions , said there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
it needs to be ascertained whether a company 's troubles are triggered by the global financial crisis and whether it can continue to operate strongly in the long-term , the chancellor said .
earlier , german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg discussed opel 's future with the premiers of the four states where opel plants are located .
the talks served to " explore various plans of action , " according to the minister .
he added that the discussion would intensify once opel revealed exact details of its rescue plan .
opel needs billions to survive on friday , the head of gm europe , carl-peter forster , said opel needed 3.3 billion euros in aid to survive and to aviod job cuts and closures .
he also said the german carmaker would be split off into a seperate unit .
speaking at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim , forster said general motors europe would present the rescue plan to german authorities on monday .
he added that the plan it included 3.0 billion euros from gm itself along with around one billion euros in cost savings .
" we need all three parts of the plan " to ensure its success , forster said .
he added that opel would repay any state aid by 2014-2015 , but said that " as a result of the automobile market crisis we are now in a very tough situation . "
opel looking to break from gm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could break from gm after 80 years of marriage opel 's activities would be regrouped within an independent unit as part of the plan , forster said , adding that no decisions had been taken yet regarding possible plant closures .
" but it is a fact that we find ourselves in an exceptional economic situation and that we will eventually have to consider closing sites , " he said .
press reports have said that an opel factory in the western city of bochum is threatened and that another in eastern eisenach might be sold .
opel itself must remain a part of gm , though its capital could be opened up to third parties or partnerships could be created , forster said .
the rescue plan was required by german authorities before any public aid would be granted to opel , which has been hit by a global auto slump and massive financial problems at gm .
gm europe works committee chief klaus franz told media that opel should be transformed into a european company , or sa , which would allow the participation of outside investors .
" after 80 years , gm is prepared to cede parts of opel , " franz said .
he called the management 's plan " very viable " and said it had been approved by workers ' representatives .

meanwhile , other reports said opel and german car manufacturer daimler , maker of mercedes-benz autos , were in negotiations over the possible sale of one of opel 's factories .
opel 's plant in the central city of eisenach might could go to the luxury car maker , resulting in the construction of a new mercedes factory in hungary " possibly being abandoned , " the thueringer allgemeine newspaper said .

an emeritus professor of ecumenical theology at the university of tuebingen in southern germany , kueng said he was " very sad " over the direction that the current church leadership was taking .
kueng , whose authority to teach catholic theology was rescinded by the vatican over his criticism of papal authority , said he was still optimistic after meeting pope benedict xvi four years ago . " i was hoping that he pope benedict would show himself as reforming , ecumenical and open for the future .
but this hope has been bitterly disappointed , " swiss-born kueng said .
vatican rejects criticism benedict xvi , formerly cardinal josef ratzinger , strained relations with the protestant churches because of his lack of willingness to engage in ecumenical dialogue .
neither did the pope 's dialogue with islam amount to more than lip service , kueng said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has been under fire ever since he lifted the excommunication of the controversial bishop richard williamson furthermore , the german-born pope severely damaged relations with members of the jewish faith by revoking the excommunication of richard williamson , a holocaust-denying bishop of an arch-conservative catholic group .

an emeritus professor of ecumenical theology at the university of tuebingen in southern germany , kueng said he was " very sad " over the direction that the current church leadership was taking .
kueng , whose authority to teach catholic theology was rescinded by the vatican over his criticism of papal authority , said he was still optimistic after meeting pope benedict xvi four years ago . " i was hoping that he pope benedict would show himself as reforming , ecumenical and open for the future .

" pope benedict xvi seriously angered many faithful catholics and suffered a severe loss of his credibility .
this is sad , " kueng said .
the pope should state that the revoking williamson 's excommunication without conditions has not been justified , kueng demanded .
kueng 's remarks have prompted fierce criticism by the vatican .

" we do not want any new dividing lines ; we do not want a europe divided along a north-south or an east-west line ; pursuing a beggar-thy-neighbor policy is unacceptable , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is to chair the meeting as current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the eve of the summit . the informal meeting of the leaders of the eu 's 27 member states is officially set to discuss the bloc 's response to the deepening economic crisis .
it is the fourth full summit to focus on that subject since october . but the summit 's preparations were marred by a bitter row between the czech republic and france - the previous holder of the presidency - after french president nicolas sarkozy criticized french car makers who had shifted production to central europe and said french auto companies should give priority to french workers . protectionist policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek wants europe to act together the czech republic , which has become a major production center for the automotive industry and has seen sizeable investments from french car firms , attacked those demands as protectionist . prague responded by saying that sunday 's summit should focus on rejecting protectionism .
sarkozy said that it should rather aim at reviving the market for inter-bank lending , seen as a key to ending the ongoing financial crisis . diplomatic sources told the dpa news agency that sarkozy and topolanek were to meet in private immediately before sunday 's meeting in a bid to resolve their differences . on saturday , the european commission , the eu 's executive , said that france had dropped plans to fund the country 's car makers on condition that they give preferential treatment to french plants and suppliers , in a move seen as likely to ease tensions . " in particular , the loan agreements with manufacturers would not contain any condition regarding either the location of their activities or a preference for france-based suppliers , " a commission statement said . european cliques trouble also flared ahead of the summit after germany hosted a meeting of the european members of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies - britain , france , germany and italy - on february 22 . spain and the netherlands were also invited to the meeting , which was meant to pave the way for a g20 summit in london on april 2 . but the inclusion of the two non-members infuriated countries such as poland , finland and sweden , who saw it as a snub and warned that such actions risked breaking the eu up into cliques . on sunday morning , poland is to host in brussels a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's nine members from central and eastern europe . diplomats from the countries involved say the meeting is routine . germany takes lead in calling for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mergel is calling for urgent action german chancellor merkel urged the eu states to work together to tackle the global economic downturn . " we should keep in mind that the economic crisis emerged out of a massive financial crisis , " merkel told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the european union must work together on making sure that something like that does n't happen again , and we need to act urgently . " with germany , europe 's biggest economy , facing its worst recession since world war ii , merkel has long called for greater oversight of financial markets , increased transparency and tougher regulations for hedge funds , rating agencies and corporate bonus structures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 28.02.2009 opinion : german teachers do n't need headscarf ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to human rights watch , the law banning female teachers from wearing the islamic headscarf in parts of germany violates the right of muslim women .
dw 's peter philipp thinks germany needs the freedom to choose . politicians and judges are taking the easy way out when they ban teachers from wearing headscarves .
the majority of female teachers are n't affected because they aren ’ t muslim .
and among their male colleagues in germany , there are hardly any religious jews who show up in the classroom wearing a hat or yarmulke .
this means that the law affects only those few muslim women in germany who so well-integrated that they have chosen to become teachers .
they are ready to be a part of this society and yet do not want to have to give up their religion and its public symbols .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what are the government and the courts afraid of ?
that muslim elementary school teachers will convert little hans or fritz to their religion ?
but that can ’ t seriously be the case : if teachers were really doing that , then one could - in fact , one would have to - ban the practice .
just as christian teachers are n't allowed to evangelize at school .
the deciding factor in the hiring of a teacher should be her professional qualifications , and only her professional qualifications .
as the saying goes , it ’ s what ’ s inside the head that counts , not what ’ s on top of it .
by banning teachers from wearing headscarves , one sends an ominous signal : the children learn that there is something false or forbidden about wearing a headscarf .
in the future they will view headscarf-wearing muslim women , who they now encounter all across germany , from this perspective .
a ban would officially sanction isolation and discrimination .
under the pretence of wanting to curb radical tendencies , the government prohibits mature citizens from wearing a piece of clothing that they consider to be an indispensible attribute of their religion .
to protect women from being forced to wear a headscarf , one would have to follow the french example by banning female students from wearing headscarves at school .
a teachers , however , should be allowed to freely choose what she wants to wear .
or one could follow the example of the so-called crucifix judgment : the german federal constitutional court originally found that crucifixes could not be hung in the classroom if someone was offended by it .
but in practice , things have worked out differently : if anyone objects to the crucifix , they have alternatives .
similarly , anyone offended by a teacher wearing a headscarf could switch to another class .
the fact is that none of the headscarf lawsuits have involved offended parents .
they were always initiated by public officials or politicians .
and for them , the issue most certainly had to do with something other than the education of german school children .

dw 's felix steiber , however , says that schools must remain neutral and secular . when angela merkel became chancellor on nov .
22 , 2005 , she ended her oath of office with the words " so help me god . "
the chancellor presented herself as a faithful christian , but in doing so , she did not pose a challenge to german constitutional order - on the contrary .
she is allowed to exercise her office as a christian , but not for christians only or in a way that privileges this religious group .
this is the essential difference .
would all germans feel represented by her if she wore a headscarf ?
definitely not .
if she chose to publicly and visibly demonstrate her muslimhood , she would on a daily basis be stressing what spiritual - or , rather , religious - ground she stands on .
that can not and should not be the legacy of the european enlightenment in the 21st century .
secular and religious powers are separated .
territorial states are no longer headed by religious leaders , and no western head of state or government can demand from his or her citizens allegiance in religious matters .
the modern european state is pluralistic : its citizens can believe in whatever they like or nothing at all .
and that ’ s why when angela merkel goes to church on easter sunday , she goes as angela merkel and not as chancellor of the federal republic of germany .
civil servants are the public face and the symbolic image of the state .
if the state is ideologically neutral , then its direct employees , i.e. civil servants - which in germany includes teachers - must also be neutral .
i can ’ t choose which tax inspector will calculate my tax debt , which police officer will give me a ticket for my driving , or which teacher will educate my child , but i need to be able to rely on the fact that they will do these things from an ideologically neutral basis .
is that discrimination ?
absolutely not .
those who do not want to comply with this neutrality by giving up certain elements of their clothing can easily choose another career .
if i don ’ t want to be served by the headscarf-wearing saleslady at a bakery , i can look for an alternative by going to another bakery .
but there is no alternative to the state .
and that ’ s why i insist upon its independence .

opel could be lined up for temporary state aid the german government is debating whether to help ailing carmaker opel after us parent company general motors said it planned to spin off its german arm which needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . german chancellor angela merkel on saturday , feb 28 , reacted cautiously to calls for her government to prop up stricken automaker opel .
speaking at a meeting of her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the northern city of kiel , merkel said her government would need to carefully examine an opel rescue plan outlined by us parent company general motors before a decision on a bail-out could be taken .
the chancellor , whose government has passed a major bailout package for banks and two economic stimulus plans worth billions , said there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
it needs to be ascertained whether a company 's troubles are triggered by the global financial crisis and whether it can continue to operate strongly in the long-term , the chancellor said .
earlier , german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg discussed opel 's future with the premiers of the four states where opel plants are located .
the talks served to " explore various plans of action , " according to the minister .
he added that the discussion would intensify once opel revealed exact details of its rescue plan .
opel needs billions to survive on friday , the head of gm europe , carl-peter forster , said opel needed 3.3 billion euros in aid to survive and to aviod job cuts and closures .
he also said the german carmaker would be split off into a seperate unit .
speaking at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim , forster said general motors europe would present the rescue plan to german authorities on monday .
he added that the plan it included 3.0 billion euros from gm itself along with around one billion euros in cost savings .
" we need all three parts of the plan " to ensure its success , forster said .
he added that opel would repay any state aid by 2014-2015 , but said that " as a result of the automobile market crisis we are now in a very tough situation . "
opel looking to break from gm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could break from gm after 80 years of marriage opel 's activities would be regrouped within an independent unit as part of the plan , forster said , adding that no decisions had been taken yet regarding possible plant closures .
" but it is a fact that we find ourselves in an exceptional economic situation and that we will eventually have to consider closing sites , " he said .
press reports have said that an opel factory in the western city of bochum is threatened and that another in eastern eisenach might be sold .
opel itself must remain a part of gm , though its capital could be opened up to third parties or partnerships could be created , forster said .
the rescue plan was required by german authorities before any public aid would be granted to opel , which has been hit by a global auto slump and massive financial problems at gm .
gm europe works committee chief klaus franz told media that opel should be transformed into a european company , or sa , which would allow the participation of outside investors .
" after 80 years , gm is prepared to cede parts of opel , " franz said .
he called the management 's plan " very viable " and said it had been approved by workers ' representatives .
government to analyze opel situation monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg will discuss plans for opel next week general motors is not in much of a position to help its german subsidiary , after posting a loss of more than $ 30 billion in 2008 .
meanwhile , other reports said opel and german car manufacturer daimler , maker of mercedes-benz autos , were in negotiations over the possible sale of one of opel 's factories .
opel 's plant in the central city of eisenach might could go to the luxury car maker , resulting in the construction of a new mercedes factory in hungary " possibly being abandoned , " the thueringer allgemeine newspaper said .
the company was examining " to what extent the hungarian project could be stopped , " sources said .
daimler said last year october it would build the factory in hungary at a cost of about 800 million euros to boost production of smaller models . nda / sp / afpr / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the association nominated me and i wo n't take any decision without a vote by the association , " she said . the 65-year-old steinbach is a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
she remains deeply controversial in poland because of her forceful promotion of the interests of expelled germans and polish leaders have strongly protested against handing her a leading role at the museum . earlier this week , germany 's league of expelles nominated steinbach to the board of the museum , putting chancellor merkel in an awkward spot .
her cabinet has the final say on the board 's composition . the issue has strained relations between poland and germany .
it also clouded a meeting between merkel and polish prime minister donald tusk in hamburg on friday . the leaders were both in hamburg for the historic ' matthiae ' dinner , an event celebrated since 1356 in the city 's town hall . decision in the making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , calld tusk " my friend and colleague " at the state dinner earlier on friday , merkel hinted she would not take any decisions that would undermine germany 's desire for " reconciliation " with poland , adding her decision on steinbach would be taken " in a few days . " amongst other things , steinbach is unpopular in poland for refusing to recognize the german-polish border drawn up after german reunification in 1990 . shortly before the meeting kicked off , tusk expressed his unease at steinbach 's possible appointment . in an interview with the financial times deutschland , tusk said that it was up to the german government to accept or reject steinbach 's appointment , but that he hoped berlin would factor in the polish standpoint .
" -lrb- a role at the museum for steinbach -rrb- painfully touches our polish sensitivity on the truth about world war two , " tusk told the ftd .
the museum will focus on the fate of ethnic germans who fled areas , including parts of modern-day poland , after world war ii .
many in poland are angry at the prospect of germans being portrayed as victims .
criticism of concept bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many orphaned children were among the displaced after the war this week , the polish ambassador to germany , marek prawda , too questioned the german league of expellees ' role in the planned museum .
the league symbolized " a tradition , which in our view has not made very many efforts at reconciliation , " prawda told german television zdf on thursday .
in addition , he said he was critical of the memorial center 's concept .
" it is problematic when you select just one element out of the chain of humanitarian catastrophes from world war ii and make this the basis of european remembrance , " prawda said .
a controversial figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach has been the president of the league of expellees for 10 years the nomination of steinbach has worsened the conflict between the league of expellees and the polish government .
tusk had previously called steinbach " inacceptable " for poland as a member of the memorial center 's board .
she would " always be a controversial figure in german-polish relations , " the prime minister said earlier this week .
steinbach has in the past accused poland of attempting to blackmail the german government .
merkel has stated that there was " no urgency " in naming the board , which must be confirmed by the cabinet .
merkel 's coalition partner , the social democrats , as well as the opposition greens and free democrats , have appealed to the chancellor to publicly promise that she will not place steinbach on the board , asking merkel to calm polish fears .
no more " mass hysteria " against steinbach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach upset german neighbors when she oposed the ratification of the german-polish border meanwhile , the league of expellees ' vice-presidents called for an end of the media campaign against steinbach .
" we find the mass hysteria in poland in particular against erika steinbach intolerable and not justifiable at all , " christian knauer and albrecht schlaeger said in a statement on thursday .
they said the league and its president maintained good relations with most countries from which germans were expelled , for example slovakia and countries of the former yugoslavia , as well as hungary and the czech republic .
knauer and schlaeger called on politicians in germany and poland to " quickly return to objectivity " in the matter , as " unjust accusations damaged the common path of poland and germany to a good future . "
poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski this week said steinbach was not suited to represent expelled germans , as her family had moved to now-polish territory only during the war .
" do people who lived there for generations really want to be identified with a person who , like steinbach , came to our country with hitler and had to flee with hitler ? "
sikorski said .
" she was never expelled .
the people who were really expelled were the polish family driven from their home in which steinbach later lived , in a land that was n't hers . " sp / / tt / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opel could be lined up for temporary state aid the german government is debating whether to help ailing carmaker opel after us parent company general motors said it planned to spin off its german arm which needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . german chancellor angela merkel on saturday , feb 28 , reacted cautiously to calls for her government to prop up stricken automaker opel .
speaking at a meeting of her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the northern city of kiel , merkel said her government would need to carefully examine an opel rescue plan outlined by us parent company general motors before a decision on a bail-out could be taken .
the chancellor , whose government has passed a major bailout package for banks and two economic stimulus plans worth billions , said there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
it needs to be ascertained whether a company 's troubles are triggered by the global financial crisis and whether it can continue to operate strongly in the long-term , the chancellor said .
earlier , german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg discussed opel 's future with the premiers of the four states where opel plants are located .
the talks served to " explore various plans of action , " according to the minister .
he added that the discussion would intensify once opel revealed exact details of its rescue plan .
opel needs billions to survive on friday , the head of gm europe , carl-peter forster , said opel needed 3.3 billion euros in aid to survive and to aviod job cuts and closures .
he also said the german carmaker would be split off into a seperate unit .
speaking at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim , forster said general motors europe would present the rescue plan to german authorities on monday .
he added that the plan it included 3.0 billion euros from gm itself along with around one billion euros in cost savings .
" we need all three parts of the plan " to ensure its success , forster said .
he added that opel would repay any state aid by 2014-2015 , but said that " as a result of the automobile market crisis we are now in a very tough situation . "
opel looking to break from gm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could break from gm after 80 years of marriage opel 's activities would be regrouped within an independent unit as part of the plan , forster said , adding that no decisions had been taken yet regarding possible plant closures .
" but it is a fact that we find ourselves in an exceptional economic situation and that we will eventually have to consider closing sites , " he said .
press reports have said that an opel factory in the western city of bochum is threatened and that another in eastern eisenach might be sold .
opel itself must remain a part of gm , though its capital could be opened up to third parties or partnerships could be created , forster said .
the rescue plan was required by german authorities before any public aid would be granted to opel , which has been hit by a global auto slump and massive financial problems at gm .
gm europe works committee chief klaus franz told media that opel should be transformed into a european company , or sa , which would allow the participation of outside investors .
" after 80 years , gm is prepared to cede parts of opel , " franz said .
he called the management 's plan " very viable " and said it had been approved by workers ' representatives .
government to analyze opel situation monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg will discuss plans for opel next week general motors is not in much of a position to help its german subsidiary , after posting a loss of more than $ 30 billion in 2008 .
meanwhile , other reports said opel and german car manufacturer daimler , maker of mercedes-benz autos , were in negotiations over the possible sale of one of opel 's factories .
opel 's plant in the central city of eisenach might could go to the luxury car maker , resulting in the construction of a new mercedes factory in hungary " possibly being abandoned , " the thueringer allgemeine newspaper said .
the company was examining " to what extent the hungarian project could be stopped , " sources said .
daimler said last year october it would build the factory in hungary at a cost of about 800 million euros to boost production of smaller models . nda / sp / afpr / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opel could be lined up for temporary state aid the german government is debating whether to help ailing carmaker opel after us parent company general motors said it planned to spin off its german arm which needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . german chancellor angela merkel on saturday , feb 28 , reacted cautiously to calls for her government to prop up stricken automaker opel .
speaking at a meeting of her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the northern city of kiel , merkel said her government would need to carefully examine an opel rescue plan outlined by us parent company general motors before a decision on a bail-out could be taken .
the chancellor , whose government has passed a major bailout package for banks and two economic stimulus plans worth billions , said there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
it needs to be ascertained whether a company 's troubles are triggered by the global financial crisis and whether it can continue to operate strongly in the long-term , the chancellor said .
earlier , german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg discussed opel 's future with the premiers of the four states where opel plants are located .
the talks served to " explore various plans of action , " according to the minister .
he added that the discussion would intensify once opel revealed exact details of its rescue plan .
opel needs billions to survive on friday , the head of gm europe , carl-peter forster , said opel needed 3.3 billion euros in aid to survive and to aviod job cuts and closures .
he also said the german carmaker would be split off into a seperate unit .
speaking at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim , forster said general motors europe would present the rescue plan to german authorities on monday .
he added that the plan it included 3.0 billion euros from gm itself along with around one billion euros in cost savings .
" we need all three parts of the plan " to ensure its success , forster said .
he added that opel would repay any state aid by 2014-2015 , but said that " as a result of the automobile market crisis we are now in a very tough situation . "
opel looking to break from gm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could break from gm after 80 years of marriage opel 's activities would be regrouped within an independent unit as part of the plan , forster said , adding that no decisions had been taken yet regarding possible plant closures .
" but it is a fact that we find ourselves in an exceptional economic situation and that we will eventually have to consider closing sites , " he said .
press reports have said that an opel factory in the western city of bochum is threatened and that another in eastern eisenach might be sold .
opel itself must remain a part of gm , though its capital could be opened up to third parties or partnerships could be created , forster said .
the rescue plan was required by german authorities before any public aid would be granted to opel , which has been hit by a global auto slump and massive financial problems at gm .
gm europe works committee chief klaus franz told media that opel should be transformed into a european company , or sa , which would allow the participation of outside investors .
" after 80 years , gm is prepared to cede parts of opel , " franz said .
he called the management 's plan " very viable " and said it had been approved by workers ' representatives .
government to analyze opel situation monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg will discuss plans for opel next week general motors is not in much of a position to help its german subsidiary , after posting a loss of more than $ 30 billion in 2008 .
meanwhile , other reports said opel and german car manufacturer daimler , maker of mercedes-benz autos , were in negotiations over the possible sale of one of opel 's factories .
opel 's plant in the central city of eisenach might could go to the luxury car maker , resulting in the construction of a new mercedes factory in hungary " possibly being abandoned , " the thueringer allgemeine newspaper said .
the company was examining " to what extent the hungarian project could be stopped , " sources said .
daimler said last year october it would build the factory in hungary at a cost of about 800 million euros to boost production of smaller models . nda / sp / afpr / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's peter philipp thinks germany needs the freedom to choose . politicians and judges are taking the easy way out when they ban teachers from wearing headscarves .
the majority of female teachers are n't affected because they aren ’ t muslim .
and among their male colleagues in germany , there are hardly any religious jews who show up in the classroom wearing a hat or yarmulke .
this means that the law affects only those few muslim women in germany who so well-integrated that they have chosen to become teachers .
they are ready to be a part of this society and yet do not want to have to give up their religion and its public symbols .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what are the government and the courts afraid of ?
that muslim elementary school teachers will convert little hans or fritz to their religion ?
but that can ’ t seriously be the case : if teachers were really doing that , then one could - in fact , one would have to - ban the practice .
just as christian teachers are n't allowed to evangelize at school .
the deciding factor in the hiring of a teacher should be her professional qualifications , and only her professional qualifications .
as the saying goes , it ’ s what ’ s inside the head that counts , not what ’ s on top of it .
by banning teachers from wearing headscarves , one sends an ominous signal : the children learn that there is something false or forbidden about wearing a headscarf .
in the future they will view headscarf-wearing muslim women , who they now encounter all across germany , from this perspective .
a ban would officially sanction isolation and discrimination .
under the pretence of wanting to curb radical tendencies , the government prohibits mature citizens from wearing a piece of clothing that they consider to be an indispensible attribute of their religion .
to protect women from being forced to wear a headscarf , one would have to follow the french example by banning female students from wearing headscarves at school .
a teachers , however , should be allowed to freely choose what she wants to wear .
or one could follow the example of the so-called crucifix judgment : the german federal constitutional court originally found that crucifixes could not be hung in the classroom if someone was offended by it .
but in practice , things have worked out differently : if anyone objects to the crucifix , they have alternatives .
similarly , anyone offended by a teacher wearing a headscarf could switch to another class .
the fact is that none of the headscarf lawsuits have involved offended parents .
they were always initiated by public officials or politicians .
and for them , the issue most certainly had to do with something other than the education of german school children .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.02.2009 merkel ally says she wo n't insist on disputed museum post großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach remains a highly controversial figure in poland because of her forceful promotion of expelled germans erika steinbach , head of germany 's league of expellees at the center of a row between berlin and warsaw over a controversial new museum , said saturday she would not insist on being appointed to the institution 's board . in an interview with german newspaper welt am sonntag , steinbach said she did not rule out withdrawing her controversial nomination for a new museum showing how millions of germans were forced out of eastern europe after the second world war . the final decision would be taken by the german league of expellees , steinbach said . " the association nominated me and i wo n't take any decision without a vote by the association , " she said . the 65-year-old steinbach is a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
she remains deeply controversial in poland because of her forceful promotion of the interests of expelled germans and polish leaders have strongly protested against handing her a leading role at the museum . earlier this week , germany 's league of expelles nominated steinbach to the board of the museum , putting chancellor merkel in an awkward spot .
her cabinet has the final say on the board 's composition . the issue has strained relations between poland and germany .
it also clouded a meeting between merkel and polish prime minister donald tusk in hamburg on friday . the leaders were both in hamburg for the historic ' matthiae ' dinner , an event celebrated since 1356 in the city 's town hall . decision in the making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , calld tusk " my friend and colleague " at the state dinner earlier on friday , merkel hinted she would not take any decisions that would undermine germany 's desire for " reconciliation " with poland , adding her decision on steinbach would be taken " in a few days . " amongst other things , steinbach is unpopular in poland for refusing to recognize the german-polish border drawn up after german reunification in 1990 . shortly before the meeting kicked off , tusk expressed his unease at steinbach 's possible appointment . in an interview with the financial times deutschland , tusk said that it was up to the german government to accept or reject steinbach 's appointment , but that he hoped berlin would factor in the polish standpoint .
" -lrb- a role at the museum for steinbach -rrb- painfully touches our polish sensitivity on the truth about world war two , " tusk told the ftd .
the museum will focus on the fate of ethnic germans who fled areas , including parts of modern-day poland , after world war ii .
many in poland are angry at the prospect of germans being portrayed as victims .
criticism of concept bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many orphaned children were among the displaced after the war this week , the polish ambassador to germany , marek prawda , too questioned the german league of expellees ' role in the planned museum .
the league symbolized " a tradition , which in our view has not made very many efforts at reconciliation , " prawda told german television zdf on thursday .
in addition , he said he was critical of the memorial center 's concept .
" it is problematic when you select just one element out of the chain of humanitarian catastrophes from world war ii and make this the basis of european remembrance , " prawda said .
a controversial figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach has been the president of the league of expellees for 10 years the nomination of steinbach has worsened the conflict between the league of expellees and the polish government .
tusk had previously called steinbach " inacceptable " for poland as a member of the memorial center 's board .
she would " always be a controversial figure in german-polish relations , " the prime minister said earlier this week .
steinbach has in the past accused poland of attempting to blackmail the german government .
merkel has stated that there was " no urgency " in naming the board , which must be confirmed by the cabinet .
merkel 's coalition partner , the social democrats , as well as the opposition greens and free democrats , have appealed to the chancellor to publicly promise that she will not place steinbach on the board , asking merkel to calm polish fears .
no more " mass hysteria " against steinbach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach upset german neighbors when she oposed the ratification of the german-polish border meanwhile , the league of expellees ' vice-presidents called for an end of the media campaign against steinbach .
" we find the mass hysteria in poland in particular against erika steinbach intolerable and not justifiable at all , " christian knauer and albrecht schlaeger said in a statement on thursday .
they said the league and its president maintained good relations with most countries from which germans were expelled , for example slovakia and countries of the former yugoslavia , as well as hungary and the czech republic .
knauer and schlaeger called on politicians in germany and poland to " quickly return to objectivity " in the matter , as " unjust accusations damaged the common path of poland and germany to a good future . "
poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski this week said steinbach was not suited to represent expelled germans , as her family had moved to now-polish territory only during the war .
" do people who lived there for generations really want to be identified with a person who , like steinbach , came to our country with hitler and had to flee with hitler ? "
sikorski said .
" she was never expelled .
the people who were really expelled were the polish family driven from their home in which steinbach later lived , in a land that was n't hers . " sp / / tt / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is an overarching theme to the trip to brussels which is the reconnection of the united states with europe and really a sense of consolidating this enormous political goodwill on both sides of the atlantic and harnessing it to a common agenda , " us assistant secretary of state for european affairs daniel fried said on friday .
the bush administration had a strained relationship with some european allies in the aftermath of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
but obama 's election was warmly welcomed in european capitals .
clinton at gaza donors ' conference clinton will begin her visit in the middle east on monday where she is to attend a donors ' conference aimed at rebuilding the gaza strip .
the conference will be held at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
she is also to visit israel and the palestinian territories before heading to europe .
european leaders want washington to pressure israel to improve aid distribution to the gaza strip which has been hit hard by israeli blockades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton is building on president obama 's message of consulting and listening to america 's allies " we would like the israelis to go further , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on friday after a visit to the hamas-run gaza strip by europe 's top diplomat javier solana .
the united states is reportedly mulling a $ 900-million aid package to rebuild gaza but clinton said friday the aid would depend on how well the palestinians meet the conditions set by the diplomatic quartet consisting of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia .
with arab backing , the quartet has laid out three conditions that any palestinian partners in peace talks with israel must meet : renouncing violence , recognizing israel and abiding by previous agreements .
" i will be announcing a commitment to a significant aid package , but it will only be spent if we determine that our goals can be furthered rather than undermined or subverted , " clinton told voice of america radio ahead of her visit .
political uncertainty complicates task in middle east clinton is expected to face a tough task as she embarks on her first fact-finding mission to the middle east .
her visit comes at an awkward time in the region .
israeli elections earlier this month provided no clear-cut winner , leaving prime minister ehud olmert to preside over a caretaker government , while benjamin netanyahu , the leader of the conservative likud party , tries to form a ruling coalition . at the same time , palestinian president mahmoud abbas is still struggling to form a unity government , further dimming hope for any tangible progress on the tattered middle east peace process .
western-backed secular party fatah and its militant palestinian islamist rival hamas agreed thursday to work together to form a unity government to end factional feuding , but clinton said the egyptian-sponsored talks would only yield results if hamas agrees to abide by the quartet 's conditions .
" i believe that it 's important , if there is some reconciliation and a move toward a unified authority , that it 's very clear that hamas knows the conditions that have been set forth by the quartet , by the arab summit , " she said .
us deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs jeffrey feltman said on friday that clinton will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert , president shimon peres , diplomatic chief tzipi livni and opposition leader benjamin netanyahu . the peace process will be discussed during several bilateral meetings on the margins of the sharm el-sheikh conference , feltman said , adding that clinton would also meet egyptian president hosni mubarak .
clinton plans face-to-face meeting with lavrov on thursday in brussels , clinton is scheduled to meet her nato counterparts and join them at an informal dinner , along with swiss officials .
clinton will also meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov for the first time .
the meeting would use " the opportunity of a new american administration to capitalize on the many areas where the us and russia have common interests and can work in a common fashion , particularly on arms control , " fried said .

opel could be lined up for temporary state aid the german government is debating whether to help ailing carmaker opel after us parent company general motors said it planned to spin off its german arm which needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . german chancellor angela merkel on saturday , feb 28 , reacted cautiously to calls for her government to prop up stricken automaker opel .
speaking at a meeting of her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the northern city of kiel , merkel said her government would need to carefully examine an opel rescue plan outlined by us parent company general motors before a decision on a bail-out could be taken .
the chancellor , whose government has passed a major bailout package for banks and two economic stimulus plans worth billions , said there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
it needs to be ascertained whether a company 's troubles are triggered by the global financial crisis and whether it can continue to operate strongly in the long-term , the chancellor said .
earlier , german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg discussed opel 's future with the premiers of the four states where opel plants are located .
the talks served to " explore various plans of action , " according to the minister .
he added that the discussion would intensify once opel revealed exact details of its rescue plan .
opel needs billions to survive on friday , the head of gm europe , carl-peter forster , said opel needed 3.3 billion euros in aid to survive and to aviod job cuts and closures .
he also said the german carmaker would be split off into a seperate unit .
speaking at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim , forster said general motors europe would present the rescue plan to german authorities on monday .
he added that the plan it included 3.0 billion euros from gm itself along with around one billion euros in cost savings .
" we need all three parts of the plan " to ensure its success , forster said .
he added that opel would repay any state aid by 2014-2015 , but said that " as a result of the automobile market crisis we are now in a very tough situation . "
opel looking to break from gm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could break from gm after 80 years of marriage opel 's activities would be regrouped within an independent unit as part of the plan , forster said , adding that no decisions had been taken yet regarding possible plant closures .
" but it is a fact that we find ourselves in an exceptional economic situation and that we will eventually have to consider closing sites , " he said .
press reports have said that an opel factory in the western city of bochum is threatened and that another in eastern eisenach might be sold .
opel itself must remain a part of gm , though its capital could be opened up to third parties or partnerships could be created , forster said .
the rescue plan was required by german authorities before any public aid would be granted to opel , which has been hit by a global auto slump and massive financial problems at gm .
gm europe works committee chief klaus franz told media that opel should be transformed into a european company , or sa , which would allow the participation of outside investors .
" after 80 years , gm is prepared to cede parts of opel , " franz said .
he called the management 's plan " very viable " and said it had been approved by workers ' representatives .
government to analyze opel situation monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg will discuss plans for opel next week general motors is not in much of a position to help its german subsidiary , after posting a loss of more than $ 30 billion in 2008 .

opel could be lined up for temporary state aid the german government is debating whether to help ailing carmaker opel after us parent company general motors said it planned to spin off its german arm which needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . german chancellor angela merkel on saturday , feb 28 , reacted cautiously to calls for her government to prop up stricken automaker opel .
speaking at a meeting of her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the northern city of kiel , merkel said her government would need to carefully examine an opel rescue plan outlined by us parent company general motors before a decision on a bail-out could be taken .
the chancellor , whose government has passed a major bailout package for banks and two economic stimulus plans worth billions , said there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
it needs to be ascertained whether a company 's troubles are triggered by the global financial crisis and whether it can continue to operate strongly in the long-term , the chancellor said .
earlier , german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg discussed opel 's future with the premiers of the four states where opel plants are located .
the talks served to " explore various plans of action , " according to the minister .
he added that the discussion would intensify once opel revealed exact details of its rescue plan .
opel needs billions to survive on friday , the head of gm europe , carl-peter forster , said opel needed 3.3 billion euros in aid to survive and to aviod job cuts and closures .
he also said the german carmaker would be split off into a seperate unit .
speaking at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim , forster said general motors europe would present the rescue plan to german authorities on monday .
he added that the plan it included 3.0 billion euros from gm itself along with around one billion euros in cost savings .
" we need all three parts of the plan " to ensure its success , forster said .
he added that opel would repay any state aid by 2014-2015 , but said that " as a result of the automobile market crisis we are now in a very tough situation . "
opel looking to break from gm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could break from gm after 80 years of marriage opel 's activities would be regrouped within an independent unit as part of the plan , forster said , adding that no decisions had been taken yet regarding possible plant closures .
" but it is a fact that we find ourselves in an exceptional economic situation and that we will eventually have to consider closing sites , " he said .
press reports have said that an opel factory in the western city of bochum is threatened and that another in eastern eisenach might be sold .
opel itself must remain a part of gm , though its capital could be opened up to third parties or partnerships could be created , forster said .
the rescue plan was required by german authorities before any public aid would be granted to opel , which has been hit by a global auto slump and massive financial problems at gm .
gm europe works committee chief klaus franz told media that opel should be transformed into a european company , or sa , which would allow the participation of outside investors .
" after 80 years , gm is prepared to cede parts of opel , " franz said .
he called the management 's plan " very viable " and said it had been approved by workers ' representatives .

" the association nominated me and i wo n't take any decision without a vote by the association , " she said . the 65-year-old steinbach is a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
she remains deeply controversial in poland because of her forceful promotion of the interests of expelled germans and polish leaders have strongly protested against handing her a leading role at the museum . earlier this week , germany 's league of expelles nominated steinbach to the board of the museum , putting chancellor merkel in an awkward spot .
her cabinet has the final say on the board 's composition . the issue has strained relations between poland and germany .
it also clouded a meeting between merkel and polish prime minister donald tusk in hamburg on friday . the leaders were both in hamburg for the historic ' matthiae ' dinner , an event celebrated since 1356 in the city 's town hall . decision in the making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , calld tusk " my friend and colleague " at the state dinner earlier on friday , merkel hinted she would not take any decisions that would undermine germany 's desire for " reconciliation " with poland , adding her decision on steinbach would be taken " in a few days . " amongst other things , steinbach is unpopular in poland for refusing to recognize the german-polish border drawn up after german reunification in 1990 . shortly before the meeting kicked off , tusk expressed his unease at steinbach 's possible appointment . in an interview with the financial times deutschland , tusk said that it was up to the german government to accept or reject steinbach 's appointment , but that he hoped berlin would factor in the polish standpoint .
" -lrb- a role at the museum for steinbach -rrb- painfully touches our polish sensitivity on the truth about world war two , " tusk told the ftd .
the museum will focus on the fate of ethnic germans who fled areas , including parts of modern-day poland , after world war ii .
many in poland are angry at the prospect of germans being portrayed as victims .
criticism of concept bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many orphaned children were among the displaced after the war this week , the polish ambassador to germany , marek prawda , too questioned the german league of expellees ' role in the planned museum .
the league symbolized " a tradition , which in our view has not made very many efforts at reconciliation , " prawda told german television zdf on thursday .
in addition , he said he was critical of the memorial center 's concept .
" it is problematic when you select just one element out of the chain of humanitarian catastrophes from world war ii and make this the basis of european remembrance , " prawda said .
a controversial figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach has been the president of the league of expellees for 10 years the nomination of steinbach has worsened the conflict between the league of expellees and the polish government .
tusk had previously called steinbach " inacceptable " for poland as a member of the memorial center 's board .
she would " always be a controversial figure in german-polish relations , " the prime minister said earlier this week .
steinbach has in the past accused poland of attempting to blackmail the german government .
merkel has stated that there was " no urgency " in naming the board , which must be confirmed by the cabinet .
merkel 's coalition partner , the social democrats , as well as the opposition greens and free democrats , have appealed to the chancellor to publicly promise that she will not place steinbach on the board , asking merkel to calm polish fears .
no more " mass hysteria " against steinbach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach upset german neighbors when she oposed the ratification of the german-polish border meanwhile , the league of expellees ' vice-presidents called for an end of the media campaign against steinbach .
" we find the mass hysteria in poland in particular against erika steinbach intolerable and not justifiable at all , " christian knauer and albrecht schlaeger said in a statement on thursday .
they said the league and its president maintained good relations with most countries from which germans were expelled , for example slovakia and countries of the former yugoslavia , as well as hungary and the czech republic .
knauer and schlaeger called on politicians in germany and poland to " quickly return to objectivity " in the matter , as " unjust accusations damaged the common path of poland and germany to a good future . "
poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski this week said steinbach was not suited to represent expelled germans , as her family had moved to now-polish territory only during the war .
" do people who lived there for generations really want to be identified with a person who , like steinbach , came to our country with hitler and had to flee with hitler ? "
sikorski said .
" she was never expelled .
the people who were really expelled were the polish family driven from their home in which steinbach later lived , in a land that was n't hers . " sp / / tt / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the majority of female teachers are n't affected because they aren ’ t muslim .

this means that the law affects only those few muslim women in germany who so well-integrated that they have chosen to become teachers .

but that can ’ t seriously be the case : if teachers were really doing that , then one could - in fact , one would have to - ban the practice .
just as christian teachers are n't allowed to evangelize at school .
the deciding factor in the hiring of a teacher should be her professional qualifications , and only her professional qualifications .
as the saying goes , it ’ s what ’ s inside the head that counts , not what ’ s on top of it .
by banning teachers from wearing headscarves , one sends an ominous signal : the children learn that there is something false or forbidden about wearing a headscarf .
in the future they will view headscarf-wearing muslim women , who they now encounter all across germany , from this perspective .
a ban would officially sanction isolation and discrimination .
under the pretence of wanting to curb radical tendencies , the government prohibits mature citizens from wearing a piece of clothing that they consider to be an indispensible attribute of their religion .
to protect women from being forced to wear a headscarf , one would have to follow the french example by banning female students from wearing headscarves at school .
a teachers , however , should be allowed to freely choose what she wants to wear .
or one could follow the example of the so-called crucifix judgment : the german federal constitutional court originally found that crucifixes could not be hung in the classroom if someone was offended by it .
but in practice , things have worked out differently : if anyone objects to the crucifix , they have alternatives .
similarly , anyone offended by a teacher wearing a headscarf could switch to another class .
the fact is that none of the headscarf lawsuits have involved offended parents .
they were always initiated by public officials or politicians .
and for them , the issue most certainly had to do with something other than the education of german school children .

" the association nominated me and i wo n't take any decision without a vote by the association , " she said . the 65-year-old steinbach is a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
she remains deeply controversial in poland because of her forceful promotion of the interests of expelled germans and polish leaders have strongly protested against handing her a leading role at the museum . earlier this week , germany 's league of expelles nominated steinbach to the board of the museum , putting chancellor merkel in an awkward spot .
her cabinet has the final say on the board 's composition . the issue has strained relations between poland and germany .
it also clouded a meeting between merkel and polish prime minister donald tusk in hamburg on friday . the leaders were both in hamburg for the historic ' matthiae ' dinner , an event celebrated since 1356 in the city 's town hall . decision in the making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , calld tusk " my friend and colleague " at the state dinner earlier on friday , merkel hinted she would not take any decisions that would undermine germany 's desire for " reconciliation " with poland , adding her decision on steinbach would be taken " in a few days . " amongst other things , steinbach is unpopular in poland for refusing to recognize the german-polish border drawn up after german reunification in 1990 . shortly before the meeting kicked off , tusk expressed his unease at steinbach 's possible appointment . in an interview with the financial times deutschland , tusk said that it was up to the german government to accept or reject steinbach 's appointment , but that he hoped berlin would factor in the polish standpoint .
" -lrb- a role at the museum for steinbach -rrb- painfully touches our polish sensitivity on the truth about world war two , " tusk told the ftd .
the museum will focus on the fate of ethnic germans who fled areas , including parts of modern-day poland , after world war ii .
many in poland are angry at the prospect of germans being portrayed as victims .
criticism of concept bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many orphaned children were among the displaced after the war this week , the polish ambassador to germany , marek prawda , too questioned the german league of expellees ' role in the planned museum .
the league symbolized " a tradition , which in our view has not made very many efforts at reconciliation , " prawda told german television zdf on thursday .
in addition , he said he was critical of the memorial center 's concept .
" it is problematic when you select just one element out of the chain of humanitarian catastrophes from world war ii and make this the basis of european remembrance , " prawda said .
a controversial figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach has been the president of the league of expellees for 10 years the nomination of steinbach has worsened the conflict between the league of expellees and the polish government .
tusk had previously called steinbach " inacceptable " for poland as a member of the memorial center 's board .
she would " always be a controversial figure in german-polish relations , " the prime minister said earlier this week .
steinbach has in the past accused poland of attempting to blackmail the german government .
merkel has stated that there was " no urgency " in naming the board , which must be confirmed by the cabinet .
merkel 's coalition partner , the social democrats , as well as the opposition greens and free democrats , have appealed to the chancellor to publicly promise that she will not place steinbach on the board , asking merkel to calm polish fears .
no more " mass hysteria " against steinbach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach upset german neighbors when she oposed the ratification of the german-polish border meanwhile , the league of expellees ' vice-presidents called for an end of the media campaign against steinbach .
" we find the mass hysteria in poland in particular against erika steinbach intolerable and not justifiable at all , " christian knauer and albrecht schlaeger said in a statement on thursday .
they said the league and its president maintained good relations with most countries from which germans were expelled , for example slovakia and countries of the former yugoslavia , as well as hungary and the czech republic .
knauer and schlaeger called on politicians in germany and poland to " quickly return to objectivity " in the matter , as " unjust accusations damaged the common path of poland and germany to a good future . "
poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski this week said steinbach was not suited to represent expelled germans , as her family had moved to now-polish territory only during the war .
" do people who lived there for generations really want to be identified with a person who , like steinbach , came to our country with hitler and had to flee with hitler ? "
sikorski said .
" she was never expelled .
the people who were really expelled were the polish family driven from their home in which steinbach later lived , in a land that was n't hers . " sp / / tt / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , but the former bayern munich shot stopper insists that wo n't slow him down nor push him any closer to actual retirement . maier will always be remembered for his efforts trying to catch a stray duck that wondered onto the field during a bundesliga match between bayern munich and vfl bochum in 1976 .
with play concentrated up the other end of the field , maier decided to concentrate on the duck .
he slowly crawled towards it before theatrically diving to catch it .
needless to say he failed in his attempt to catch the animal , but achieved his goal of entertaining the fans .
such is the degree that maier is remembered for his theatrics both inside and outside the goalmouth , his birthday has been honored by the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , and the german government , which posted online articles commemorating the career and life of the man .
the dfb has proclaimed maier german goalkeeper of the century .
no slowing down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer , left , and maier were instrumental in the world cup win although he is now at an age at which most people gratefully accept retirement , maier insists his years of dotage are still far off .
true to his word , maier will not celebrate his birthday quietly with family and friends in bavaria .
instead , he will be on stage in berlin , performing as a singer and magician in the show " das ueberraschungsfest der volksmusik , " the dfb said on its web site .
" it will be great .
there will be plenty of people to celebrate with me and i do n't have to pay , " maier told german news agency dpa .
" i have no interest in retiring .
if one retires you become even older , at least your spirit becomes older , " he said .
" if you have no plans in your life you might as well get buried immediately . "
celebrated keeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maier also helped west germany to a 1972 european championship maier was between the sticks for west germany when it hosted and won the 1974 world cup , playing alongside german soccer greats franz beckenbauer , berti vogts and gerd mueller .
two years earlier he helped west germany win the european championships .
with bayern he won five bundesliga titles , four german cups and three european champions trophies .
" those were the highlights of my life , " he said .
maier had 95 caps and played 473 bundesliga games for bayern munich , but in 1979 his career came to an abrupt end when he was badly injured in a car accident .
just short of a year ago , he said goodbye to his soccer life when he retired as bayern munich goalkeeping coach - around the same time his prodigy oliver kahn retired .
" i was with the club since i was 15 years old , but it had to be .
i ca n't be there until i am 100 , even though there is a tinge of sadness . " dfm / nda / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is the fourth full summit to focus on that subject since october . but the summit 's preparations were marred by a bitter row between the czech republic and france - the previous holder of the presidency - after french president nicolas sarkozy criticized french car makers who had shifted production to central europe and said french auto companies should give priority to french workers . protectionist policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek wants europe to act together the czech republic , which has become a major production center for the automotive industry and has seen sizeable investments from french car firms , attacked those demands as protectionist . prague responded by saying that sunday 's summit should focus on rejecting protectionism .
sarkozy said that it should rather aim at reviving the market for inter-bank lending , seen as a key to ending the ongoing financial crisis . diplomatic sources told the dpa news agency that sarkozy and topolanek were to meet in private immediately before sunday 's meeting in a bid to resolve their differences . on saturday , the european commission , the eu 's executive , said that france had dropped plans to fund the country 's car makers on condition that they give preferential treatment to french plants and suppliers , in a move seen as likely to ease tensions . " in particular , the loan agreements with manufacturers would not contain any condition regarding either the location of their activities or a preference for france-based suppliers , " a commission statement said . european cliques trouble also flared ahead of the summit after germany hosted a meeting of the european members of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies - britain , france , germany and italy - on february 22 . spain and the netherlands were also invited to the meeting , which was meant to pave the way for a g20 summit in london on april 2 . but the inclusion of the two non-members infuriated countries such as poland , finland and sweden , who saw it as a snub and warned that such actions risked breaking the eu up into cliques . on sunday morning , poland is to host in brussels a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's nine members from central and eastern europe . diplomats from the countries involved say the meeting is routine . germany takes lead in calling for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mergel is calling for urgent action german chancellor merkel urged the eu states to work together to tackle the global economic downturn .

" there is an overarching theme to the trip to brussels which is the reconnection of the united states with europe and really a sense of consolidating this enormous political goodwill on both sides of the atlantic and harnessing it to a common agenda , " us assistant secretary of state for european affairs daniel fried said on friday .
the bush administration had a strained relationship with some european allies in the aftermath of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
but obama 's election was warmly welcomed in european capitals .
clinton at gaza donors ' conference clinton will begin her visit in the middle east on monday where she is to attend a donors ' conference aimed at rebuilding the gaza strip .
the conference will be held at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
she is also to visit israel and the palestinian territories before heading to europe .
european leaders want washington to pressure israel to improve aid distribution to the gaza strip which has been hit hard by israeli blockades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton is building on president obama 's message of consulting and listening to america 's allies " we would like the israelis to go further , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on friday after a visit to the hamas-run gaza strip by europe 's top diplomat javier solana .
the united states is reportedly mulling a $ 900-million aid package to rebuild gaza but clinton said friday the aid would depend on how well the palestinians meet the conditions set by the diplomatic quartet consisting of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia .
with arab backing , the quartet has laid out three conditions that any palestinian partners in peace talks with israel must meet : renouncing violence , recognizing israel and abiding by previous agreements .
" i will be announcing a commitment to a significant aid package , but it will only be spent if we determine that our goals can be furthered rather than undermined or subverted , " clinton told voice of america radio ahead of her visit .
political uncertainty complicates task in middle east clinton is expected to face a tough task as she embarks on her first fact-finding mission to the middle east .
her visit comes at an awkward time in the region .
israeli elections earlier this month provided no clear-cut winner , leaving prime minister ehud olmert to preside over a caretaker government , while benjamin netanyahu , the leader of the conservative likud party , tries to form a ruling coalition . at the same time , palestinian president mahmoud abbas is still struggling to form a unity government , further dimming hope for any tangible progress on the tattered middle east peace process .
western-backed secular party fatah and its militant palestinian islamist rival hamas agreed thursday to work together to form a unity government to end factional feuding , but clinton said the egyptian-sponsored talks would only yield results if hamas agrees to abide by the quartet 's conditions .
" i believe that it 's important , if there is some reconciliation and a move toward a unified authority , that it 's very clear that hamas knows the conditions that have been set forth by the quartet , by the arab summit , " she said .
us deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs jeffrey feltman said on friday that clinton will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert , president shimon peres , diplomatic chief tzipi livni and opposition leader benjamin netanyahu . the peace process will be discussed during several bilateral meetings on the margins of the sharm el-sheikh conference , feltman said , adding that clinton would also meet egyptian president hosni mubarak .
clinton plans face-to-face meeting with lavrov on thursday in brussels , clinton is scheduled to meet her nato counterparts and join them at an informal dinner , along with swiss officials .
clinton will also meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov for the first time .
the meeting would use " the opportunity of a new american administration to capitalize on the many areas where the us and russia have common interests and can work in a common fashion , particularly on arms control , " fried said .
clinton will wrap up her visit with a stop in turkey where she is to meet president abdullah gul , and foreign minister ali babacan . nda / sp / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an emeritus professor of ecumenical theology at the university of tuebingen in southern germany , kueng said he was " very sad " over the direction that the current church leadership was taking .
kueng , whose authority to teach catholic theology was rescinded by the vatican over his criticism of papal authority , said he was still optimistic after meeting pope benedict xvi four years ago . " i was hoping that he pope benedict would show himself as reforming , ecumenical and open for the future .
but this hope has been bitterly disappointed , " swiss-born kueng said .
vatican rejects criticism benedict xvi , formerly cardinal josef ratzinger , strained relations with the protestant churches because of his lack of willingness to engage in ecumenical dialogue .
neither did the pope 's dialogue with islam amount to more than lip service , kueng said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has been under fire ever since he lifted the excommunication of the controversial bishop richard williamson furthermore , the german-born pope severely damaged relations with members of the jewish faith by revoking the excommunication of richard williamson , a holocaust-denying bishop of an arch-conservative catholic group .
" pope benedict xvi seriously angered many faithful catholics and suffered a severe loss of his credibility .
this is sad , " kueng said .
the pope should state that the revoking williamson 's excommunication without conditions has not been justified , kueng demanded .
kueng 's remarks have prompted fierce criticism by the vatican .

" there is an overarching theme to the trip to brussels which is the reconnection of the united states with europe and really a sense of consolidating this enormous political goodwill on both sides of the atlantic and harnessing it to a common agenda , " us assistant secretary of state for european affairs daniel fried said on friday .
the bush administration had a strained relationship with some european allies in the aftermath of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
but obama 's election was warmly welcomed in european capitals .
clinton at gaza donors ' conference clinton will begin her visit in the middle east on monday where she is to attend a donors ' conference aimed at rebuilding the gaza strip .
the conference will be held at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
she is also to visit israel and the palestinian territories before heading to europe .
european leaders want washington to pressure israel to improve aid distribution to the gaza strip which has been hit hard by israeli blockades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton is building on president obama 's message of consulting and listening to america 's allies " we would like the israelis to go further , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on friday after a visit to the hamas-run gaza strip by europe 's top diplomat javier solana .
the united states is reportedly mulling a $ 900-million aid package to rebuild gaza but clinton said friday the aid would depend on how well the palestinians meet the conditions set by the diplomatic quartet consisting of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia .
with arab backing , the quartet has laid out three conditions that any palestinian partners in peace talks with israel must meet : renouncing violence , recognizing israel and abiding by previous agreements .
" i will be announcing a commitment to a significant aid package , but it will only be spent if we determine that our goals can be furthered rather than undermined or subverted , " clinton told voice of america radio ahead of her visit .
political uncertainty complicates task in middle east clinton is expected to face a tough task as she embarks on her first fact-finding mission to the middle east .
her visit comes at an awkward time in the region .
israeli elections earlier this month provided no clear-cut winner , leaving prime minister ehud olmert to preside over a caretaker government , while benjamin netanyahu , the leader of the conservative likud party , tries to form a ruling coalition . at the same time , palestinian president mahmoud abbas is still struggling to form a unity government , further dimming hope for any tangible progress on the tattered middle east peace process .
western-backed secular party fatah and its militant palestinian islamist rival hamas agreed thursday to work together to form a unity government to end factional feuding , but clinton said the egyptian-sponsored talks would only yield results if hamas agrees to abide by the quartet 's conditions .
" i believe that it 's important , if there is some reconciliation and a move toward a unified authority , that it 's very clear that hamas knows the conditions that have been set forth by the quartet , by the arab summit , " she said .
us deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs jeffrey feltman said on friday that clinton will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert , president shimon peres , diplomatic chief tzipi livni and opposition leader benjamin netanyahu . the peace process will be discussed during several bilateral meetings on the margins of the sharm el-sheikh conference , feltman said , adding that clinton would also meet egyptian president hosni mubarak .
clinton plans face-to-face meeting with lavrov on thursday in brussels , clinton is scheduled to meet her nato counterparts and join them at an informal dinner , along with swiss officials .
clinton will also meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov for the first time .
the meeting would use " the opportunity of a new american administration to capitalize on the many areas where the us and russia have common interests and can work in a common fashion , particularly on arms control , " fried said .
clinton will wrap up her visit with a stop in turkey where she is to meet president abdullah gul , and foreign minister ali babacan . nda / sp / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the conference will be held at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .

european leaders want washington to pressure israel to improve aid distribution to the gaza strip which has been hit hard by israeli blockades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton is building on president obama 's message of consulting and listening to america 's allies " we would like the israelis to go further , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on friday after a visit to the hamas-run gaza strip by europe 's top diplomat javier solana .
the united states is reportedly mulling a $ 900-million aid package to rebuild gaza but clinton said friday the aid would depend on how well the palestinians meet the conditions set by the diplomatic quartet consisting of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia .
with arab backing , the quartet has laid out three conditions that any palestinian partners in peace talks with israel must meet : renouncing violence , recognizing israel and abiding by previous agreements .
" i will be announcing a commitment to a significant aid package , but it will only be spent if we determine that our goals can be furthered rather than undermined or subverted , " clinton told voice of america radio ahead of her visit .

western-backed secular party fatah and its militant palestinian islamist rival hamas agreed thursday to work together to form a unity government to end factional feuding , but clinton said the egyptian-sponsored talks would only yield results if hamas agrees to abide by the quartet 's conditions .
" i believe that it 's important , if there is some reconciliation and a move toward a unified authority , that it 's very clear that hamas knows the conditions that have been set forth by the quartet , by the arab summit , " she said .
us deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs jeffrey feltman said on friday that clinton will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert , president shimon peres , diplomatic chief tzipi livni and opposition leader benjamin netanyahu . the peace process will be discussed during several bilateral meetings on the margins of the sharm el-sheikh conference , feltman said , adding that clinton would also meet egyptian president hosni mubarak .

opel could be lined up for temporary state aid the german government is debating whether to help ailing carmaker opel after us parent company general motors said it planned to spin off its german arm which needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . german chancellor angela merkel on saturday , feb 28 , reacted cautiously to calls for her government to prop up stricken automaker opel .
speaking at a meeting of her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the northern city of kiel , merkel said her government would need to carefully examine an opel rescue plan outlined by us parent company general motors before a decision on a bail-out could be taken .
the chancellor , whose government has passed a major bailout package for banks and two economic stimulus plans worth billions , said there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
it needs to be ascertained whether a company 's troubles are triggered by the global financial crisis and whether it can continue to operate strongly in the long-term , the chancellor said .
earlier , german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg discussed opel 's future with the premiers of the four states where opel plants are located .
the talks served to " explore various plans of action , " according to the minister .
he added that the discussion would intensify once opel revealed exact details of its rescue plan .
opel needs billions to survive on friday , the head of gm europe , carl-peter forster , said opel needed 3.3 billion euros in aid to survive and to aviod job cuts and closures .
he also said the german carmaker would be split off into a seperate unit .
speaking at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim , forster said general motors europe would present the rescue plan to german authorities on monday .
he added that the plan it included 3.0 billion euros from gm itself along with around one billion euros in cost savings .
" we need all three parts of the plan " to ensure its success , forster said .
he added that opel would repay any state aid by 2014-2015 , but said that " as a result of the automobile market crisis we are now in a very tough situation . "
opel looking to break from gm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could break from gm after 80 years of marriage opel 's activities would be regrouped within an independent unit as part of the plan , forster said , adding that no decisions had been taken yet regarding possible plant closures .
" but it is a fact that we find ourselves in an exceptional economic situation and that we will eventually have to consider closing sites , " he said .
press reports have said that an opel factory in the western city of bochum is threatened and that another in eastern eisenach might be sold .
opel itself must remain a part of gm , though its capital could be opened up to third parties or partnerships could be created , forster said .
the rescue plan was required by german authorities before any public aid would be granted to opel , which has been hit by a global auto slump and massive financial problems at gm .
gm europe works committee chief klaus franz told media that opel should be transformed into a european company , or sa , which would allow the participation of outside investors .
" after 80 years , gm is prepared to cede parts of opel , " franz said .
he called the management 's plan " very viable " and said it had been approved by workers ' representatives .

opel 's plant in the central city of eisenach might could go to the luxury car maker , resulting in the construction of a new mercedes factory in hungary " possibly being abandoned , " the thueringer allgemeine newspaper said .
the company was examining " to what extent the hungarian project could be stopped , " sources said .

opel could be lined up for temporary state aid the german government is debating whether to help ailing carmaker opel after us parent company general motors said it planned to spin off its german arm which needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . german chancellor angela merkel on saturday , feb 28 , reacted cautiously to calls for her government to prop up stricken automaker opel .
speaking at a meeting of her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the northern city of kiel , merkel said her government would need to carefully examine an opel rescue plan outlined by us parent company general motors before a decision on a bail-out could be taken .
the chancellor , whose government has passed a major bailout package for banks and two economic stimulus plans worth billions , said there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
it needs to be ascertained whether a company 's troubles are triggered by the global financial crisis and whether it can continue to operate strongly in the long-term , the chancellor said .
earlier , german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg discussed opel 's future with the premiers of the four states where opel plants are located .
the talks served to " explore various plans of action , " according to the minister .
he added that the discussion would intensify once opel revealed exact details of its rescue plan .
opel needs billions to survive on friday , the head of gm europe , carl-peter forster , said opel needed 3.3 billion euros in aid to survive and to aviod job cuts and closures .
he also said the german carmaker would be split off into a seperate unit .
speaking at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim , forster said general motors europe would present the rescue plan to german authorities on monday .
he added that the plan it included 3.0 billion euros from gm itself along with around one billion euros in cost savings .
" we need all three parts of the plan " to ensure its success , forster said .
he added that opel would repay any state aid by 2014-2015 , but said that " as a result of the automobile market crisis we are now in a very tough situation . "

opel could be lined up for temporary state aid the german government is debating whether to help ailing carmaker opel after us parent company general motors said it planned to spin off its german arm which needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . german chancellor angela merkel on saturday , feb 28 , reacted cautiously to calls for her government to prop up stricken automaker opel .
speaking at a meeting of her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the northern city of kiel , merkel said her government would need to carefully examine an opel rescue plan outlined by us parent company general motors before a decision on a bail-out could be taken .
the chancellor , whose government has passed a major bailout package for banks and two economic stimulus plans worth billions , said there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
it needs to be ascertained whether a company 's troubles are triggered by the global financial crisis and whether it can continue to operate strongly in the long-term , the chancellor said .
earlier , german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg discussed opel 's future with the premiers of the four states where opel plants are located .
the talks served to " explore various plans of action , " according to the minister .
he added that the discussion would intensify once opel revealed exact details of its rescue plan .
opel needs billions to survive on friday , the head of gm europe , carl-peter forster , said opel needed 3.3 billion euros in aid to survive and to aviod job cuts and closures .
he also said the german carmaker would be split off into a seperate unit .
speaking at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim , forster said general motors europe would present the rescue plan to german authorities on monday .
he added that the plan it included 3.0 billion euros from gm itself along with around one billion euros in cost savings .
" we need all three parts of the plan " to ensure its success , forster said .
he added that opel would repay any state aid by 2014-2015 , but said that " as a result of the automobile market crisis we are now in a very tough situation . "
opel looking to break from gm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could break from gm after 80 years of marriage opel 's activities would be regrouped within an independent unit as part of the plan , forster said , adding that no decisions had been taken yet regarding possible plant closures .
" but it is a fact that we find ourselves in an exceptional economic situation and that we will eventually have to consider closing sites , " he said .
press reports have said that an opel factory in the western city of bochum is threatened and that another in eastern eisenach might be sold .
opel itself must remain a part of gm , though its capital could be opened up to third parties or partnerships could be created , forster said .
the rescue plan was required by german authorities before any public aid would be granted to opel , which has been hit by a global auto slump and massive financial problems at gm .
gm europe works committee chief klaus franz told media that opel should be transformed into a european company , or sa , which would allow the participation of outside investors .
" after 80 years , gm is prepared to cede parts of opel , " franz said .
he called the management 's plan " very viable " and said it had been approved by workers ' representatives .
government to analyze opel situation monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg will discuss plans for opel next week general motors is not in much of a position to help its german subsidiary , after posting a loss of more than $ 30 billion in 2008 .
meanwhile , other reports said opel and german car manufacturer daimler , maker of mercedes-benz autos , were in negotiations over the possible sale of one of opel 's factories .
opel 's plant in the central city of eisenach might could go to the luxury car maker , resulting in the construction of a new mercedes factory in hungary " possibly being abandoned , " the thueringer allgemeine newspaper said .
the company was examining " to what extent the hungarian project could be stopped , " sources said .
daimler said last year october it would build the factory in hungary at a cost of about 800 million euros to boost production of smaller models . nda / sp / afpr / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is an overarching theme to the trip to brussels which is the reconnection of the united states with europe and really a sense of consolidating this enormous political goodwill on both sides of the atlantic and harnessing it to a common agenda , " us assistant secretary of state for european affairs daniel fried said on friday .
the bush administration had a strained relationship with some european allies in the aftermath of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
but obama 's election was warmly welcomed in european capitals .
clinton at gaza donors ' conference clinton will begin her visit in the middle east on monday where she is to attend a donors ' conference aimed at rebuilding the gaza strip .
the conference will be held at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
she is also to visit israel and the palestinian territories before heading to europe .
european leaders want washington to pressure israel to improve aid distribution to the gaza strip which has been hit hard by israeli blockades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton is building on president obama 's message of consulting and listening to america 's allies " we would like the israelis to go further , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on friday after a visit to the hamas-run gaza strip by europe 's top diplomat javier solana .
the united states is reportedly mulling a $ 900-million aid package to rebuild gaza but clinton said friday the aid would depend on how well the palestinians meet the conditions set by the diplomatic quartet consisting of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia .
with arab backing , the quartet has laid out three conditions that any palestinian partners in peace talks with israel must meet : renouncing violence , recognizing israel and abiding by previous agreements .
" i will be announcing a commitment to a significant aid package , but it will only be spent if we determine that our goals can be furthered rather than undermined or subverted , " clinton told voice of america radio ahead of her visit .
political uncertainty complicates task in middle east clinton is expected to face a tough task as she embarks on her first fact-finding mission to the middle east .
her visit comes at an awkward time in the region .
israeli elections earlier this month provided no clear-cut winner , leaving prime minister ehud olmert to preside over a caretaker government , while benjamin netanyahu , the leader of the conservative likud party , tries to form a ruling coalition . at the same time , palestinian president mahmoud abbas is still struggling to form a unity government , further dimming hope for any tangible progress on the tattered middle east peace process .
western-backed secular party fatah and its militant palestinian islamist rival hamas agreed thursday to work together to form a unity government to end factional feuding , but clinton said the egyptian-sponsored talks would only yield results if hamas agrees to abide by the quartet 's conditions .
" i believe that it 's important , if there is some reconciliation and a move toward a unified authority , that it 's very clear that hamas knows the conditions that have been set forth by the quartet , by the arab summit , " she said .
us deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs jeffrey feltman said on friday that clinton will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert , president shimon peres , diplomatic chief tzipi livni and opposition leader benjamin netanyahu . the peace process will be discussed during several bilateral meetings on the margins of the sharm el-sheikh conference , feltman said , adding that clinton would also meet egyptian president hosni mubarak .
clinton plans face-to-face meeting with lavrov on thursday in brussels , clinton is scheduled to meet her nato counterparts and join them at an informal dinner , along with swiss officials .
clinton will also meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov for the first time .
the meeting would use " the opportunity of a new american administration to capitalize on the many areas where the us and russia have common interests and can work in a common fashion , particularly on arms control , " fried said .

dw 's peter philipp thinks germany needs the freedom to choose . politicians and judges are taking the easy way out when they ban teachers from wearing headscarves .
the majority of female teachers are n't affected because they aren ’ t muslim .
and among their male colleagues in germany , there are hardly any religious jews who show up in the classroom wearing a hat or yarmulke .
this means that the law affects only those few muslim women in germany who so well-integrated that they have chosen to become teachers .
they are ready to be a part of this society and yet do not want to have to give up their religion and its public symbols .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what are the government and the courts afraid of ?
that muslim elementary school teachers will convert little hans or fritz to their religion ?
but that can ’ t seriously be the case : if teachers were really doing that , then one could - in fact , one would have to - ban the practice .
just as christian teachers are n't allowed to evangelize at school .
the deciding factor in the hiring of a teacher should be her professional qualifications , and only her professional qualifications .
as the saying goes , it ’ s what ’ s inside the head that counts , not what ’ s on top of it .
by banning teachers from wearing headscarves , one sends an ominous signal : the children learn that there is something false or forbidden about wearing a headscarf .
in the future they will view headscarf-wearing muslim women , who they now encounter all across germany , from this perspective .
a ban would officially sanction isolation and discrimination .
under the pretence of wanting to curb radical tendencies , the government prohibits mature citizens from wearing a piece of clothing that they consider to be an indispensible attribute of their religion .
to protect women from being forced to wear a headscarf , one would have to follow the french example by banning female students from wearing headscarves at school .
a teachers , however , should be allowed to freely choose what she wants to wear .
or one could follow the example of the so-called crucifix judgment : the german federal constitutional court originally found that crucifixes could not be hung in the classroom if someone was offended by it .
but in practice , things have worked out differently : if anyone objects to the crucifix , they have alternatives .
similarly , anyone offended by a teacher wearing a headscarf could switch to another class .
the fact is that none of the headscarf lawsuits have involved offended parents .
they were always initiated by public officials or politicians .
and for them , the issue most certainly had to do with something other than the education of german school children .

dw 's felix steiber , however , says that schools must remain neutral and secular . when angela merkel became chancellor on nov .
22 , 2005 , she ended her oath of office with the words " so help me god . "
the chancellor presented herself as a faithful christian , but in doing so , she did not pose a challenge to german constitutional order - on the contrary .
she is allowed to exercise her office as a christian , but not for christians only or in a way that privileges this religious group .
this is the essential difference .
would all germans feel represented by her if she wore a headscarf ?
definitely not .
if she chose to publicly and visibly demonstrate her muslimhood , she would on a daily basis be stressing what spiritual - or , rather , religious - ground she stands on .
that can not and should not be the legacy of the european enlightenment in the 21st century .
secular and religious powers are separated .
territorial states are no longer headed by religious leaders , and no western head of state or government can demand from his or her citizens allegiance in religious matters .
the modern european state is pluralistic : its citizens can believe in whatever they like or nothing at all .
and that ’ s why when angela merkel goes to church on easter sunday , she goes as angela merkel and not as chancellor of the federal republic of germany .
civil servants are the public face and the symbolic image of the state .
if the state is ideologically neutral , then its direct employees , i.e. civil servants - which in germany includes teachers - must also be neutral .
i can ’ t choose which tax inspector will calculate my tax debt , which police officer will give me a ticket for my driving , or which teacher will educate my child , but i need to be able to rely on the fact that they will do these things from an ideologically neutral basis .
is that discrimination ?
absolutely not .
those who do not want to comply with this neutrality by giving up certain elements of their clothing can easily choose another career .
if i don ’ t want to be served by the headscarf-wearing saleslady at a bakery , i can look for an alternative by going to another bakery .
but there is no alternative to the state .
and that ’ s why i insist upon its independence .

opel could be lined up for temporary state aid the german government is debating whether to help ailing carmaker opel after us parent company general motors said it planned to spin off its german arm which needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . german chancellor angela merkel on saturday , feb 28 , reacted cautiously to calls for her government to prop up stricken automaker opel .
speaking at a meeting of her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the northern city of kiel , merkel said her government would need to carefully examine an opel rescue plan outlined by us parent company general motors before a decision on a bail-out could be taken .
the chancellor , whose government has passed a major bailout package for banks and two economic stimulus plans worth billions , said there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
it needs to be ascertained whether a company 's troubles are triggered by the global financial crisis and whether it can continue to operate strongly in the long-term , the chancellor said .
earlier , german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg discussed opel 's future with the premiers of the four states where opel plants are located .
the talks served to " explore various plans of action , " according to the minister .
he added that the discussion would intensify once opel revealed exact details of its rescue plan .
opel needs billions to survive on friday , the head of gm europe , carl-peter forster , said opel needed 3.3 billion euros in aid to survive and to aviod job cuts and closures .
he also said the german carmaker would be split off into a seperate unit .
speaking at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim , forster said general motors europe would present the rescue plan to german authorities on monday .
he added that the plan it included 3.0 billion euros from gm itself along with around one billion euros in cost savings .
" we need all three parts of the plan " to ensure its success , forster said .
he added that opel would repay any state aid by 2014-2015 , but said that " as a result of the automobile market crisis we are now in a very tough situation . "
opel looking to break from gm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could break from gm after 80 years of marriage opel 's activities would be regrouped within an independent unit as part of the plan , forster said , adding that no decisions had been taken yet regarding possible plant closures .
" but it is a fact that we find ourselves in an exceptional economic situation and that we will eventually have to consider closing sites , " he said .
press reports have said that an opel factory in the western city of bochum is threatened and that another in eastern eisenach might be sold .
opel itself must remain a part of gm , though its capital could be opened up to third parties or partnerships could be created , forster said .
the rescue plan was required by german authorities before any public aid would be granted to opel , which has been hit by a global auto slump and massive financial problems at gm .
gm europe works committee chief klaus franz told media that opel should be transformed into a european company , or sa , which would allow the participation of outside investors .

" the association nominated me and i wo n't take any decision without a vote by the association , " she said . the 65-year-old steinbach is a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
she remains deeply controversial in poland because of her forceful promotion of the interests of expelled germans and polish leaders have strongly protested against handing her a leading role at the museum . earlier this week , germany 's league of expelles nominated steinbach to the board of the museum , putting chancellor merkel in an awkward spot .
her cabinet has the final say on the board 's composition . the issue has strained relations between poland and germany .
it also clouded a meeting between merkel and polish prime minister donald tusk in hamburg on friday . the leaders were both in hamburg for the historic ' matthiae ' dinner , an event celebrated since 1356 in the city 's town hall . decision in the making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , calld tusk " my friend and colleague " at the state dinner earlier on friday , merkel hinted she would not take any decisions that would undermine germany 's desire for " reconciliation " with poland , adding her decision on steinbach would be taken " in a few days . " amongst other things , steinbach is unpopular in poland for refusing to recognize the german-polish border drawn up after german reunification in 1990 . shortly before the meeting kicked off , tusk expressed his unease at steinbach 's possible appointment . in an interview with the financial times deutschland , tusk said that it was up to the german government to accept or reject steinbach 's appointment , but that he hoped berlin would factor in the polish standpoint .
" -lrb- a role at the museum for steinbach -rrb- painfully touches our polish sensitivity on the truth about world war two , " tusk told the ftd .
the museum will focus on the fate of ethnic germans who fled areas , including parts of modern-day poland , after world war ii .
many in poland are angry at the prospect of germans being portrayed as victims .
criticism of concept bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many orphaned children were among the displaced after the war this week , the polish ambassador to germany , marek prawda , too questioned the german league of expellees ' role in the planned museum .
the league symbolized " a tradition , which in our view has not made very many efforts at reconciliation , " prawda told german television zdf on thursday .
in addition , he said he was critical of the memorial center 's concept .
" it is problematic when you select just one element out of the chain of humanitarian catastrophes from world war ii and make this the basis of european remembrance , " prawda said .
a controversial figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach has been the president of the league of expellees for 10 years the nomination of steinbach has worsened the conflict between the league of expellees and the polish government .
tusk had previously called steinbach " inacceptable " for poland as a member of the memorial center 's board .
she would " always be a controversial figure in german-polish relations , " the prime minister said earlier this week .
steinbach has in the past accused poland of attempting to blackmail the german government .
merkel has stated that there was " no urgency " in naming the board , which must be confirmed by the cabinet .
merkel 's coalition partner , the social democrats , as well as the opposition greens and free democrats , have appealed to the chancellor to publicly promise that she will not place steinbach on the board , asking merkel to calm polish fears .
no more " mass hysteria " against steinbach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach upset german neighbors when she oposed the ratification of the german-polish border meanwhile , the league of expellees ' vice-presidents called for an end of the media campaign against steinbach .
" we find the mass hysteria in poland in particular against erika steinbach intolerable and not justifiable at all , " christian knauer and albrecht schlaeger said in a statement on thursday .
they said the league and its president maintained good relations with most countries from which germans were expelled , for example slovakia and countries of the former yugoslavia , as well as hungary and the czech republic .
knauer and schlaeger called on politicians in germany and poland to " quickly return to objectivity " in the matter , as " unjust accusations damaged the common path of poland and germany to a good future . "
poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski this week said steinbach was not suited to represent expelled germans , as her family had moved to now-polish territory only during the war .
" do people who lived there for generations really want to be identified with a person who , like steinbach , came to our country with hitler and had to flee with hitler ? "
sikorski said .
" she was never expelled .
the people who were really expelled were the polish family driven from their home in which steinbach later lived , in a land that was n't hers . " sp / / tt / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's peter philipp thinks germany needs the freedom to choose . politicians and judges are taking the easy way out when they ban teachers from wearing headscarves .
the majority of female teachers are n't affected because they aren ’ t muslim .
and among their male colleagues in germany , there are hardly any religious jews who show up in the classroom wearing a hat or yarmulke .
this means that the law affects only those few muslim women in germany who so well-integrated that they have chosen to become teachers .
they are ready to be a part of this society and yet do not want to have to give up their religion and its public symbols .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what are the government and the courts afraid of ?
that muslim elementary school teachers will convert little hans or fritz to their religion ?
but that can ’ t seriously be the case : if teachers were really doing that , then one could - in fact , one would have to - ban the practice .
just as christian teachers are n't allowed to evangelize at school .
the deciding factor in the hiring of a teacher should be her professional qualifications , and only her professional qualifications .
as the saying goes , it ’ s what ’ s inside the head that counts , not what ’ s on top of it .
by banning teachers from wearing headscarves , one sends an ominous signal : the children learn that there is something false or forbidden about wearing a headscarf .
in the future they will view headscarf-wearing muslim women , who they now encounter all across germany , from this perspective .
a ban would officially sanction isolation and discrimination .
under the pretence of wanting to curb radical tendencies , the government prohibits mature citizens from wearing a piece of clothing that they consider to be an indispensible attribute of their religion .
to protect women from being forced to wear a headscarf , one would have to follow the french example by banning female students from wearing headscarves at school .
a teachers , however , should be allowed to freely choose what she wants to wear .
or one could follow the example of the so-called crucifix judgment : the german federal constitutional court originally found that crucifixes could not be hung in the classroom if someone was offended by it .
but in practice , things have worked out differently : if anyone objects to the crucifix , they have alternatives .
similarly , anyone offended by a teacher wearing a headscarf could switch to another class .
the fact is that none of the headscarf lawsuits have involved offended parents .
they were always initiated by public officials or politicians .
and for them , the issue most certainly had to do with something other than the education of german school children .

an emeritus professor of ecumenical theology at the university of tuebingen in southern germany , kueng said he was " very sad " over the direction that the current church leadership was taking .
kueng , whose authority to teach catholic theology was rescinded by the vatican over his criticism of papal authority , said he was still optimistic after meeting pope benedict xvi four years ago . " i was hoping that he pope benedict would show himself as reforming , ecumenical and open for the future .
but this hope has been bitterly disappointed , " swiss-born kueng said .

neither did the pope 's dialogue with islam amount to more than lip service , kueng said .

" pope benedict xvi seriously angered many faithful catholics and suffered a severe loss of his credibility .
this is sad , " kueng said .
the pope should state that the revoking williamson 's excommunication without conditions has not been justified , kueng demanded .
kueng 's remarks have prompted fierce criticism by the vatican .
cardinal angelo sodano , dean of the college of cardinals at the vatican rejected kueng 's criticism , calling it " bitter " and " hurtful " and said it did n't promote the unity of the church . nda / sp / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opel could be lined up for temporary state aid the german government is debating whether to help ailing carmaker opel after us parent company general motors said it planned to spin off its german arm which needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . german chancellor angela merkel on saturday , feb 28 , reacted cautiously to calls for her government to prop up stricken automaker opel .
speaking at a meeting of her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the northern city of kiel , merkel said her government would need to carefully examine an opel rescue plan outlined by us parent company general motors before a decision on a bail-out could be taken .
the chancellor , whose government has passed a major bailout package for banks and two economic stimulus plans worth billions , said there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
it needs to be ascertained whether a company 's troubles are triggered by the global financial crisis and whether it can continue to operate strongly in the long-term , the chancellor said .
earlier , german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg discussed opel 's future with the premiers of the four states where opel plants are located .
the talks served to " explore various plans of action , " according to the minister .
he added that the discussion would intensify once opel revealed exact details of its rescue plan .
opel needs billions to survive on friday , the head of gm europe , carl-peter forster , said opel needed 3.3 billion euros in aid to survive and to aviod job cuts and closures .
he also said the german carmaker would be split off into a seperate unit .
speaking at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim , forster said general motors europe would present the rescue plan to german authorities on monday .
he added that the plan it included 3.0 billion euros from gm itself along with around one billion euros in cost savings .
" we need all three parts of the plan " to ensure its success , forster said .
he added that opel would repay any state aid by 2014-2015 , but said that " as a result of the automobile market crisis we are now in a very tough situation . "
opel looking to break from gm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could break from gm after 80 years of marriage opel 's activities would be regrouped within an independent unit as part of the plan , forster said , adding that no decisions had been taken yet regarding possible plant closures .
" but it is a fact that we find ourselves in an exceptional economic situation and that we will eventually have to consider closing sites , " he said .
press reports have said that an opel factory in the western city of bochum is threatened and that another in eastern eisenach might be sold .
opel itself must remain a part of gm , though its capital could be opened up to third parties or partnerships could be created , forster said .
the rescue plan was required by german authorities before any public aid would be granted to opel , which has been hit by a global auto slump and massive financial problems at gm .
gm europe works committee chief klaus franz told media that opel should be transformed into a european company , or sa , which would allow the participation of outside investors .
" after 80 years , gm is prepared to cede parts of opel , " franz said .
he called the management 's plan " very viable " and said it had been approved by workers ' representatives .

" there is an overarching theme to the trip to brussels which is the reconnection of the united states with europe and really a sense of consolidating this enormous political goodwill on both sides of the atlantic and harnessing it to a common agenda , " us assistant secretary of state for european affairs daniel fried said on friday .
the bush administration had a strained relationship with some european allies in the aftermath of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
but obama 's election was warmly welcomed in european capitals .
clinton at gaza donors ' conference clinton will begin her visit in the middle east on monday where she is to attend a donors ' conference aimed at rebuilding the gaza strip .
the conference will be held at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
she is also to visit israel and the palestinian territories before heading to europe .
european leaders want washington to pressure israel to improve aid distribution to the gaza strip which has been hit hard by israeli blockades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton is building on president obama 's message of consulting and listening to america 's allies " we would like the israelis to go further , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on friday after a visit to the hamas-run gaza strip by europe 's top diplomat javier solana .
the united states is reportedly mulling a $ 900-million aid package to rebuild gaza but clinton said friday the aid would depend on how well the palestinians meet the conditions set by the diplomatic quartet consisting of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia .
with arab backing , the quartet has laid out three conditions that any palestinian partners in peace talks with israel must meet : renouncing violence , recognizing israel and abiding by previous agreements .
" i will be announcing a commitment to a significant aid package , but it will only be spent if we determine that our goals can be furthered rather than undermined or subverted , " clinton told voice of america radio ahead of her visit .
political uncertainty complicates task in middle east clinton is expected to face a tough task as she embarks on her first fact-finding mission to the middle east .
her visit comes at an awkward time in the region .
israeli elections earlier this month provided no clear-cut winner , leaving prime minister ehud olmert to preside over a caretaker government , while benjamin netanyahu , the leader of the conservative likud party , tries to form a ruling coalition . at the same time , palestinian president mahmoud abbas is still struggling to form a unity government , further dimming hope for any tangible progress on the tattered middle east peace process .
western-backed secular party fatah and its militant palestinian islamist rival hamas agreed thursday to work together to form a unity government to end factional feuding , but clinton said the egyptian-sponsored talks would only yield results if hamas agrees to abide by the quartet 's conditions .
" i believe that it 's important , if there is some reconciliation and a move toward a unified authority , that it 's very clear that hamas knows the conditions that have been set forth by the quartet , by the arab summit , " she said .
us deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs jeffrey feltman said on friday that clinton will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert , president shimon peres , diplomatic chief tzipi livni and opposition leader benjamin netanyahu . the peace process will be discussed during several bilateral meetings on the margins of the sharm el-sheikh conference , feltman said , adding that clinton would also meet egyptian president hosni mubarak .
clinton plans face-to-face meeting with lavrov on thursday in brussels , clinton is scheduled to meet her nato counterparts and join them at an informal dinner , along with swiss officials .

28 , but the former bayern munich shot stopper insists that wo n't slow him down nor push him any closer to actual retirement . maier will always be remembered for his efforts trying to catch a stray duck that wondered onto the field during a bundesliga match between bayern munich and vfl bochum in 1976 .
with play concentrated up the other end of the field , maier decided to concentrate on the duck .
he slowly crawled towards it before theatrically diving to catch it .
needless to say he failed in his attempt to catch the animal , but achieved his goal of entertaining the fans .
such is the degree that maier is remembered for his theatrics both inside and outside the goalmouth , his birthday has been honored by the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , and the german government , which posted online articles commemorating the career and life of the man .
the dfb has proclaimed maier german goalkeeper of the century .

true to his word , maier will not celebrate his birthday quietly with family and friends in bavaria .
instead , he will be on stage in berlin , performing as a singer and magician in the show " das ueberraschungsfest der volksmusik , " the dfb said on its web site .
" it will be great .
there will be plenty of people to celebrate with me and i do n't have to pay , " maier told german news agency dpa .
" i have no interest in retiring .
if one retires you become even older , at least your spirit becomes older , " he said .
" if you have no plans in your life you might as well get buried immediately . "
celebrated keeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maier also helped west germany to a 1972 european championship maier was between the sticks for west germany when it hosted and won the 1974 world cup , playing alongside german soccer greats franz beckenbauer , berti vogts and gerd mueller .
two years earlier he helped west germany win the european championships .
with bayern he won five bundesliga titles , four german cups and three european champions trophies .
" those were the highlights of my life , " he said .
maier had 95 caps and played 473 bundesliga games for bayern munich , but in 1979 his career came to an abrupt end when he was badly injured in a car accident .
just short of a year ago , he said goodbye to his soccer life when he retired as bayern munich goalkeeping coach - around the same time his prodigy oliver kahn retired .
" i was with the club since i was 15 years old , but it had to be .

with arab backing , the quartet has laid out three conditions that any palestinian partners in peace talks with israel must meet : renouncing violence , recognizing israel and abiding by previous agreements .

opel could be lined up for temporary state aid the german government is debating whether to help ailing carmaker opel after us parent company general motors said it planned to spin off its german arm which needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . german chancellor angela merkel on saturday , feb 28 , reacted cautiously to calls for her government to prop up stricken automaker opel .
speaking at a meeting of her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the northern city of kiel , merkel said her government would need to carefully examine an opel rescue plan outlined by us parent company general motors before a decision on a bail-out could be taken .
the chancellor , whose government has passed a major bailout package for banks and two economic stimulus plans worth billions , said there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
it needs to be ascertained whether a company 's troubles are triggered by the global financial crisis and whether it can continue to operate strongly in the long-term , the chancellor said .
earlier , german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg discussed opel 's future with the premiers of the four states where opel plants are located .
the talks served to " explore various plans of action , " according to the minister .
he added that the discussion would intensify once opel revealed exact details of its rescue plan .
opel needs billions to survive on friday , the head of gm europe , carl-peter forster , said opel needed 3.3 billion euros in aid to survive and to aviod job cuts and closures .
he also said the german carmaker would be split off into a seperate unit .
speaking at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim , forster said general motors europe would present the rescue plan to german authorities on monday .
he added that the plan it included 3.0 billion euros from gm itself along with around one billion euros in cost savings .
" we need all three parts of the plan " to ensure its success , forster said .
he added that opel would repay any state aid by 2014-2015 , but said that " as a result of the automobile market crisis we are now in a very tough situation . "
opel looking to break from gm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could break from gm after 80 years of marriage opel 's activities would be regrouped within an independent unit as part of the plan , forster said , adding that no decisions had been taken yet regarding possible plant closures .
" but it is a fact that we find ourselves in an exceptional economic situation and that we will eventually have to consider closing sites , " he said .
press reports have said that an opel factory in the western city of bochum is threatened and that another in eastern eisenach might be sold .
opel itself must remain a part of gm , though its capital could be opened up to third parties or partnerships could be created , forster said .
the rescue plan was required by german authorities before any public aid would be granted to opel , which has been hit by a global auto slump and massive financial problems at gm .
gm europe works committee chief klaus franz told media that opel should be transformed into a european company , or sa , which would allow the participation of outside investors .
" after 80 years , gm is prepared to cede parts of opel , " franz said .
he called the management 's plan " very viable " and said it had been approved by workers ' representatives .
government to analyze opel situation monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg will discuss plans for opel next week general motors is not in much of a position to help its german subsidiary , after posting a loss of more than $ 30 billion in 2008 .
meanwhile , other reports said opel and german car manufacturer daimler , maker of mercedes-benz autos , were in negotiations over the possible sale of one of opel 's factories .
opel 's plant in the central city of eisenach might could go to the luxury car maker , resulting in the construction of a new mercedes factory in hungary " possibly being abandoned , " the thueringer allgemeine newspaper said .
the company was examining " to what extent the hungarian project could be stopped , " sources said .
daimler said last year october it would build the factory in hungary at a cost of about 800 million euros to boost production of smaller models . nda / sp / afpr / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deciding factor in the hiring of a teacher should be her professional qualifications , and only her professional qualifications .

under the pretence of wanting to curb radical tendencies , the government prohibits mature citizens from wearing a piece of clothing that they consider to be an indispensible attribute of their religion .

" the association nominated me and i wo n't take any decision without a vote by the association , " she said . the 65-year-old steinbach is a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
she remains deeply controversial in poland because of her forceful promotion of the interests of expelled germans and polish leaders have strongly protested against handing her a leading role at the museum . earlier this week , germany 's league of expelles nominated steinbach to the board of the museum , putting chancellor merkel in an awkward spot .
her cabinet has the final say on the board 's composition . the issue has strained relations between poland and germany .
it also clouded a meeting between merkel and polish prime minister donald tusk in hamburg on friday . the leaders were both in hamburg for the historic ' matthiae ' dinner , an event celebrated since 1356 in the city 's town hall . decision in the making ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , calld tusk " my friend and colleague " at the state dinner earlier on friday , merkel hinted she would not take any decisions that would undermine germany 's desire for " reconciliation " with poland , adding her decision on steinbach would be taken " in a few days . " amongst other things , steinbach is unpopular in poland for refusing to recognize the german-polish border drawn up after german reunification in 1990 . shortly before the meeting kicked off , tusk expressed his unease at steinbach 's possible appointment . in an interview with the financial times deutschland , tusk said that it was up to the german government to accept or reject steinbach 's appointment , but that he hoped berlin would factor in the polish standpoint .
" -lrb- a role at the museum for steinbach -rrb- painfully touches our polish sensitivity on the truth about world war two , " tusk told the ftd .
the museum will focus on the fate of ethnic germans who fled areas , including parts of modern-day poland , after world war ii .
many in poland are angry at the prospect of germans being portrayed as victims .
criticism of concept bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many orphaned children were among the displaced after the war this week , the polish ambassador to germany , marek prawda , too questioned the german league of expellees ' role in the planned museum .
the league symbolized " a tradition , which in our view has not made very many efforts at reconciliation , " prawda told german television zdf on thursday .
in addition , he said he was critical of the memorial center 's concept .
" it is problematic when you select just one element out of the chain of humanitarian catastrophes from world war ii and make this the basis of european remembrance , " prawda said .
a controversial figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach has been the president of the league of expellees for 10 years the nomination of steinbach has worsened the conflict between the league of expellees and the polish government .
tusk had previously called steinbach " inacceptable " for poland as a member of the memorial center 's board .
she would " always be a controversial figure in german-polish relations , " the prime minister said earlier this week .
steinbach has in the past accused poland of attempting to blackmail the german government .
merkel has stated that there was " no urgency " in naming the board , which must be confirmed by the cabinet .
merkel 's coalition partner , the social democrats , as well as the opposition greens and free democrats , have appealed to the chancellor to publicly promise that she will not place steinbach on the board , asking merkel to calm polish fears .
no more " mass hysteria " against steinbach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach upset german neighbors when she oposed the ratification of the german-polish border meanwhile , the league of expellees ' vice-presidents called for an end of the media campaign against steinbach .
" we find the mass hysteria in poland in particular against erika steinbach intolerable and not justifiable at all , " christian knauer and albrecht schlaeger said in a statement on thursday .
they said the league and its president maintained good relations with most countries from which germans were expelled , for example slovakia and countries of the former yugoslavia , as well as hungary and the czech republic .
knauer and schlaeger called on politicians in germany and poland to " quickly return to objectivity " in the matter , as " unjust accusations damaged the common path of poland and germany to a good future . "
poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski this week said steinbach was not suited to represent expelled germans , as her family had moved to now-polish territory only during the war .
" do people who lived there for generations really want to be identified with a person who , like steinbach , came to our country with hitler and had to flee with hitler ? "
sikorski said .
" she was never expelled .
the people who were really expelled were the polish family driven from their home in which steinbach later lived , in a land that was n't hers . " sp / / tt / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the association nominated me and i wo n't take any decision without a vote by the association , " she said . the 65-year-old steinbach is a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
she remains deeply controversial in poland because of her forceful promotion of the interests of expelled germans and polish leaders have strongly protested against handing her a leading role at the museum . earlier this week , germany 's league of expelles nominated steinbach to the board of the museum , putting chancellor merkel in an awkward spot .

dw 's felix steiber , however , says that schools must remain neutral and secular . when angela merkel became chancellor on nov .
22 , 2005 , she ended her oath of office with the words " so help me god . "
the chancellor presented herself as a faithful christian , but in doing so , she did not pose a challenge to german constitutional order - on the contrary .
she is allowed to exercise her office as a christian , but not for christians only or in a way that privileges this religious group .
this is the essential difference .
would all germans feel represented by her if she wore a headscarf ?
definitely not .
if she chose to publicly and visibly demonstrate her muslimhood , she would on a daily basis be stressing what spiritual - or , rather , religious - ground she stands on .
that can not and should not be the legacy of the european enlightenment in the 21st century .
secular and religious powers are separated .
territorial states are no longer headed by religious leaders , and no western head of state or government can demand from his or her citizens allegiance in religious matters .
the modern european state is pluralistic : its citizens can believe in whatever they like or nothing at all .
and that ’ s why when angela merkel goes to church on easter sunday , she goes as angela merkel and not as chancellor of the federal republic of germany .
civil servants are the public face and the symbolic image of the state .
if the state is ideologically neutral , then its direct employees , i.e. civil servants - which in germany includes teachers - must also be neutral .
i can ’ t choose which tax inspector will calculate my tax debt , which police officer will give me a ticket for my driving , or which teacher will educate my child , but i need to be able to rely on the fact that they will do these things from an ideologically neutral basis .
is that discrimination ?
absolutely not .
those who do not want to comply with this neutrality by giving up certain elements of their clothing can easily choose another career .
if i don ’ t want to be served by the headscarf-wearing saleslady at a bakery , i can look for an alternative by going to another bakery .
but there is no alternative to the state .
and that ’ s why i insist upon its independence .

dw 's peter philipp thinks germany needs the freedom to choose . politicians and judges are taking the easy way out when they ban teachers from wearing headscarves .
the majority of female teachers are n't affected because they aren ’ t muslim .
and among their male colleagues in germany , there are hardly any religious jews who show up in the classroom wearing a hat or yarmulke .
this means that the law affects only those few muslim women in germany who so well-integrated that they have chosen to become teachers .
they are ready to be a part of this society and yet do not want to have to give up their religion and its public symbols .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what are the government and the courts afraid of ?
that muslim elementary school teachers will convert little hans or fritz to their religion ?
but that can ’ t seriously be the case : if teachers were really doing that , then one could - in fact , one would have to - ban the practice .
just as christian teachers are n't allowed to evangelize at school .
the deciding factor in the hiring of a teacher should be her professional qualifications , and only her professional qualifications .
as the saying goes , it ’ s what ’ s inside the head that counts , not what ’ s on top of it .
by banning teachers from wearing headscarves , one sends an ominous signal : the children learn that there is something false or forbidden about wearing a headscarf .
in the future they will view headscarf-wearing muslim women , who they now encounter all across germany , from this perspective .
a ban would officially sanction isolation and discrimination .
under the pretence of wanting to curb radical tendencies , the government prohibits mature citizens from wearing a piece of clothing that they consider to be an indispensible attribute of their religion .
to protect women from being forced to wear a headscarf , one would have to follow the french example by banning female students from wearing headscarves at school .
a teachers , however , should be allowed to freely choose what she wants to wear .
or one could follow the example of the so-called crucifix judgment : the german federal constitutional court originally found that crucifixes could not be hung in the classroom if someone was offended by it .
but in practice , things have worked out differently : if anyone objects to the crucifix , they have alternatives .
similarly , anyone offended by a teacher wearing a headscarf could switch to another class .
the fact is that none of the headscarf lawsuits have involved offended parents .
they were always initiated by public officials or politicians .
and for them , the issue most certainly had to do with something other than the education of german school children .

" there is an overarching theme to the trip to brussels which is the reconnection of the united states with europe and really a sense of consolidating this enormous political goodwill on both sides of the atlantic and harnessing it to a common agenda , " us assistant secretary of state for european affairs daniel fried said on friday .
the bush administration had a strained relationship with some european allies in the aftermath of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
but obama 's election was warmly welcomed in european capitals .
clinton at gaza donors ' conference clinton will begin her visit in the middle east on monday where she is to attend a donors ' conference aimed at rebuilding the gaza strip .
the conference will be held at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
she is also to visit israel and the palestinian territories before heading to europe .
european leaders want washington to pressure israel to improve aid distribution to the gaza strip which has been hit hard by israeli blockades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton is building on president obama 's message of consulting and listening to america 's allies " we would like the israelis to go further , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on friday after a visit to the hamas-run gaza strip by europe 's top diplomat javier solana .
the united states is reportedly mulling a $ 900-million aid package to rebuild gaza but clinton said friday the aid would depend on how well the palestinians meet the conditions set by the diplomatic quartet consisting of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia .
with arab backing , the quartet has laid out three conditions that any palestinian partners in peace talks with israel must meet : renouncing violence , recognizing israel and abiding by previous agreements .
" i will be announcing a commitment to a significant aid package , but it will only be spent if we determine that our goals can be furthered rather than undermined or subverted , " clinton told voice of america radio ahead of her visit .
political uncertainty complicates task in middle east clinton is expected to face a tough task as she embarks on her first fact-finding mission to the middle east .
her visit comes at an awkward time in the region .
israeli elections earlier this month provided no clear-cut winner , leaving prime minister ehud olmert to preside over a caretaker government , while benjamin netanyahu , the leader of the conservative likud party , tries to form a ruling coalition . at the same time , palestinian president mahmoud abbas is still struggling to form a unity government , further dimming hope for any tangible progress on the tattered middle east peace process .
western-backed secular party fatah and its militant palestinian islamist rival hamas agreed thursday to work together to form a unity government to end factional feuding , but clinton said the egyptian-sponsored talks would only yield results if hamas agrees to abide by the quartet 's conditions .
" i believe that it 's important , if there is some reconciliation and a move toward a unified authority , that it 's very clear that hamas knows the conditions that have been set forth by the quartet , by the arab summit , " she said .
us deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs jeffrey feltman said on friday that clinton will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert , president shimon peres , diplomatic chief tzipi livni and opposition leader benjamin netanyahu . the peace process will be discussed during several bilateral meetings on the margins of the sharm el-sheikh conference , feltman said , adding that clinton would also meet egyptian president hosni mubarak .
clinton plans face-to-face meeting with lavrov on thursday in brussels , clinton is scheduled to meet her nato counterparts and join them at an informal dinner , along with swiss officials .
clinton will also meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov for the first time .
the meeting would use " the opportunity of a new american administration to capitalize on the many areas where the us and russia have common interests and can work in a common fashion , particularly on arms control , " fried said .
clinton will wrap up her visit with a stop in turkey where she is to meet president abdullah gul , and foreign minister ali babacan . nda / sp / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opel could be lined up for temporary state aid the german government is debating whether to help ailing carmaker opel after us parent company general motors said it planned to spin off its german arm which needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . german chancellor angela merkel on saturday , feb 28 , reacted cautiously to calls for her government to prop up stricken automaker opel .
speaking at a meeting of her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the northern city of kiel , merkel said her government would need to carefully examine an opel rescue plan outlined by us parent company general motors before a decision on a bail-out could be taken .
the chancellor , whose government has passed a major bailout package for banks and two economic stimulus plans worth billions , said there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
it needs to be ascertained whether a company 's troubles are triggered by the global financial crisis and whether it can continue to operate strongly in the long-term , the chancellor said .
earlier , german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg discussed opel 's future with the premiers of the four states where opel plants are located .
the talks served to " explore various plans of action , " according to the minister .
he added that the discussion would intensify once opel revealed exact details of its rescue plan .
opel needs billions to survive on friday , the head of gm europe , carl-peter forster , said opel needed 3.3 billion euros in aid to survive and to aviod job cuts and closures .
he also said the german carmaker would be split off into a seperate unit .
speaking at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim , forster said general motors europe would present the rescue plan to german authorities on monday .
he added that the plan it included 3.0 billion euros from gm itself along with around one billion euros in cost savings .
" we need all three parts of the plan " to ensure its success , forster said .
he added that opel would repay any state aid by 2014-2015 , but said that " as a result of the automobile market crisis we are now in a very tough situation . "
opel looking to break from gm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could break from gm after 80 years of marriage opel 's activities would be regrouped within an independent unit as part of the plan , forster said , adding that no decisions had been taken yet regarding possible plant closures .
" but it is a fact that we find ourselves in an exceptional economic situation and that we will eventually have to consider closing sites , " he said .
press reports have said that an opel factory in the western city of bochum is threatened and that another in eastern eisenach might be sold .
opel itself must remain a part of gm , though its capital could be opened up to third parties or partnerships could be created , forster said .
the rescue plan was required by german authorities before any public aid would be granted to opel , which has been hit by a global auto slump and massive financial problems at gm .
gm europe works committee chief klaus franz told media that opel should be transformed into a european company , or sa , which would allow the participation of outside investors .
" after 80 years , gm is prepared to cede parts of opel , " franz said .
he called the management 's plan " very viable " and said it had been approved by workers ' representatives .
government to analyze opel situation monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg will discuss plans for opel next week general motors is not in much of a position to help its german subsidiary , after posting a loss of more than $ 30 billion in 2008 .
meanwhile , other reports said opel and german car manufacturer daimler , maker of mercedes-benz autos , were in negotiations over the possible sale of one of opel 's factories .
opel 's plant in the central city of eisenach might could go to the luxury car maker , resulting in the construction of a new mercedes factory in hungary " possibly being abandoned , " the thueringer allgemeine newspaper said .
the company was examining " to what extent the hungarian project could be stopped , " sources said .
daimler said last year october it would build the factory in hungary at a cost of about 800 million euros to boost production of smaller models . nda / sp / afpr / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i believe that it 's important , if there is some reconciliation and a move toward a unified authority , that it 's very clear that hamas knows the conditions that have been set forth by the quartet , by the arab summit , " she said .
us deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs jeffrey feltman said on friday that clinton will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert , president shimon peres , diplomatic chief tzipi livni and opposition leader benjamin netanyahu . the peace process will be discussed during several bilateral meetings on the margins of the sharm el-sheikh conference , feltman said , adding that clinton would also meet egyptian president hosni mubarak .
clinton plans face-to-face meeting with lavrov on thursday in brussels , clinton is scheduled to meet her nato counterparts and join them at an informal dinner , along with swiss officials .
clinton will also meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov for the first time .
the meeting would use " the opportunity of a new american administration to capitalize on the many areas where the us and russia have common interests and can work in a common fashion , particularly on arms control , " fried said .
clinton will wrap up her visit with a stop in turkey where she is to meet president abdullah gul , and foreign minister ali babacan . nda / sp / afp / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is the fourth full summit to focus on that subject since october . but the summit 's preparations were marred by a bitter row between the czech republic and france - the previous holder of the presidency - after french president nicolas sarkozy criticized french car makers who had shifted production to central europe and said french auto companies should give priority to french workers . protectionist policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek wants europe to act together the czech republic , which has become a major production center for the automotive industry and has seen sizeable investments from french car firms , attacked those demands as protectionist . prague responded by saying that sunday 's summit should focus on rejecting protectionism .
sarkozy said that it should rather aim at reviving the market for inter-bank lending , seen as a key to ending the ongoing financial crisis . diplomatic sources told the dpa news agency that sarkozy and topolanek were to meet in private immediately before sunday 's meeting in a bid to resolve their differences . on saturday , the european commission , the eu 's executive , said that france had dropped plans to fund the country 's car makers on condition that they give preferential treatment to french plants and suppliers , in a move seen as likely to ease tensions . " in particular , the loan agreements with manufacturers would not contain any condition regarding either the location of their activities or a preference for france-based suppliers , " a commission statement said . european cliques trouble also flared ahead of the summit after germany hosted a meeting of the european members of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies - britain , france , germany and italy - on february 22 . spain and the netherlands were also invited to the meeting , which was meant to pave the way for a g20 summit in london on april 2 . but the inclusion of the two non-members infuriated countries such as poland , finland and sweden , who saw it as a snub and warned that such actions risked breaking the eu up into cliques . on sunday morning , poland is to host in brussels a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's nine members from central and eastern europe . diplomats from the countries involved say the meeting is routine . germany takes lead in calling for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mergel is calling for urgent action german chancellor merkel urged the eu states to work together to tackle the global economic downturn .

" we do not want any new dividing lines ; we do not want a europe divided along a north-south or an east-west line ; pursuing a beggar-thy-neighbor policy is unacceptable , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is to chair the meeting as current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the eve of the summit . the informal meeting of the leaders of the eu 's 27 member states is officially set to discuss the bloc 's response to the deepening economic crisis .
it is the fourth full summit to focus on that subject since october . but the summit 's preparations were marred by a bitter row between the czech republic and france - the previous holder of the presidency - after french president nicolas sarkozy criticized french car makers who had shifted production to central europe and said french auto companies should give priority to french workers . protectionist policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek wants europe to act together the czech republic , which has become a major production center for the automotive industry and has seen sizeable investments from french car firms , attacked those demands as protectionist . prague responded by saying that sunday 's summit should focus on rejecting protectionism .
sarkozy said that it should rather aim at reviving the market for inter-bank lending , seen as a key to ending the ongoing financial crisis . diplomatic sources told the dpa news agency that sarkozy and topolanek were to meet in private immediately before sunday 's meeting in a bid to resolve their differences . on saturday , the european commission , the eu 's executive , said that france had dropped plans to fund the country 's car makers on condition that they give preferential treatment to french plants and suppliers , in a move seen as likely to ease tensions . " in particular , the loan agreements with manufacturers would not contain any condition regarding either the location of their activities or a preference for france-based suppliers , " a commission statement said . european cliques trouble also flared ahead of the summit after germany hosted a meeting of the european members of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies - britain , france , germany and italy - on february 22 . spain and the netherlands were also invited to the meeting , which was meant to pave the way for a g20 summit in london on april 2 . but the inclusion of the two non-members infuriated countries such as poland , finland and sweden , who saw it as a snub and warned that such actions risked breaking the eu up into cliques . on sunday morning , poland is to host in brussels a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's nine members from central and eastern europe . diplomats from the countries involved say the meeting is routine . germany takes lead in calling for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mergel is calling for urgent action german chancellor merkel urged the eu states to work together to tackle the global economic downturn . " we should keep in mind that the economic crisis emerged out of a massive financial crisis , " merkel told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 28.02.2009 opinion : german teachers do n't need headscarf ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to human rights watch , the law banning female teachers from wearing the islamic headscarf in parts of germany violates the right of muslim women .
dw 's peter philipp thinks germany needs the freedom to choose . politicians and judges are taking the easy way out when they ban teachers from wearing headscarves .
the majority of female teachers are n't affected because they aren ’ t muslim .
and among their male colleagues in germany , there are hardly any religious jews who show up in the classroom wearing a hat or yarmulke .
this means that the law affects only those few muslim women in germany who so well-integrated that they have chosen to become teachers .
they are ready to be a part of this society and yet do not want to have to give up their religion and its public symbols .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what are the government and the courts afraid of ?
that muslim elementary school teachers will convert little hans or fritz to their religion ?
but that can ’ t seriously be the case : if teachers were really doing that , then one could - in fact , one would have to - ban the practice .
just as christian teachers are n't allowed to evangelize at school .
the deciding factor in the hiring of a teacher should be her professional qualifications , and only her professional qualifications .
as the saying goes , it ’ s what ’ s inside the head that counts , not what ’ s on top of it .
by banning teachers from wearing headscarves , one sends an ominous signal : the children learn that there is something false or forbidden about wearing a headscarf .
in the future they will view headscarf-wearing muslim women , who they now encounter all across germany , from this perspective .
a ban would officially sanction isolation and discrimination .
under the pretence of wanting to curb radical tendencies , the government prohibits mature citizens from wearing a piece of clothing that they consider to be an indispensible attribute of their religion .
to protect women from being forced to wear a headscarf , one would have to follow the french example by banning female students from wearing headscarves at school .
a teachers , however , should be allowed to freely choose what she wants to wear .
or one could follow the example of the so-called crucifix judgment : the german federal constitutional court originally found that crucifixes could not be hung in the classroom if someone was offended by it .
but in practice , things have worked out differently : if anyone objects to the crucifix , they have alternatives .
similarly , anyone offended by a teacher wearing a headscarf could switch to another class .
the fact is that none of the headscarf lawsuits have involved offended parents .
they were always initiated by public officials or politicians .
and for them , the issue most certainly had to do with something other than the education of german school children .

opel could be lined up for temporary state aid the german government is debating whether to help ailing carmaker opel after us parent company general motors said it planned to spin off its german arm which needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . german chancellor angela merkel on saturday , feb 28 , reacted cautiously to calls for her government to prop up stricken automaker opel .
speaking at a meeting of her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the northern city of kiel , merkel said her government would need to carefully examine an opel rescue plan outlined by us parent company general motors before a decision on a bail-out could be taken .
the chancellor , whose government has passed a major bailout package for banks and two economic stimulus plans worth billions , said there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
it needs to be ascertained whether a company 's troubles are triggered by the global financial crisis and whether it can continue to operate strongly in the long-term , the chancellor said .
earlier , german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg discussed opel 's future with the premiers of the four states where opel plants are located .
the talks served to " explore various plans of action , " according to the minister .
he added that the discussion would intensify once opel revealed exact details of its rescue plan .
opel needs billions to survive on friday , the head of gm europe , carl-peter forster , said opel needed 3.3 billion euros in aid to survive and to aviod job cuts and closures .
he also said the german carmaker would be split off into a seperate unit .
speaking at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim , forster said general motors europe would present the rescue plan to german authorities on monday .
he added that the plan it included 3.0 billion euros from gm itself along with around one billion euros in cost savings .
" we need all three parts of the plan " to ensure its success , forster said .
he added that opel would repay any state aid by 2014-2015 , but said that " as a result of the automobile market crisis we are now in a very tough situation . "
opel looking to break from gm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could break from gm after 80 years of marriage opel 's activities would be regrouped within an independent unit as part of the plan , forster said , adding that no decisions had been taken yet regarding possible plant closures .
" but it is a fact that we find ourselves in an exceptional economic situation and that we will eventually have to consider closing sites , " he said .
press reports have said that an opel factory in the western city of bochum is threatened and that another in eastern eisenach might be sold .
opel itself must remain a part of gm , though its capital could be opened up to third parties or partnerships could be created , forster said .
the rescue plan was required by german authorities before any public aid would be granted to opel , which has been hit by a global auto slump and massive financial problems at gm .
gm europe works committee chief klaus franz told media that opel should be transformed into a european company , or sa , which would allow the participation of outside investors .
" after 80 years , gm is prepared to cede parts of opel , " franz said .
he called the management 's plan " very viable " and said it had been approved by workers ' representatives .
government to analyze opel situation monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg will discuss plans for opel next week general motors is not in much of a position to help its german subsidiary , after posting a loss of more than $ 30 billion in 2008 .
meanwhile , other reports said opel and german car manufacturer daimler , maker of mercedes-benz autos , were in negotiations over the possible sale of one of opel 's factories .
opel 's plant in the central city of eisenach might could go to the luxury car maker , resulting in the construction of a new mercedes factory in hungary " possibly being abandoned , " the thueringer allgemeine newspaper said .
the company was examining " to what extent the hungarian project could be stopped , " sources said .

an emeritus professor of ecumenical theology at the university of tuebingen in southern germany , kueng said he was " very sad " over the direction that the current church leadership was taking .
kueng , whose authority to teach catholic theology was rescinded by the vatican over his criticism of papal authority , said he was still optimistic after meeting pope benedict xvi four years ago . " i was hoping that he pope benedict would show himself as reforming , ecumenical and open for the future .
but this hope has been bitterly disappointed , " swiss-born kueng said .
vatican rejects criticism benedict xvi , formerly cardinal josef ratzinger , strained relations with the protestant churches because of his lack of willingness to engage in ecumenical dialogue .
neither did the pope 's dialogue with islam amount to more than lip service , kueng said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has been under fire ever since he lifted the excommunication of the controversial bishop richard williamson furthermore , the german-born pope severely damaged relations with members of the jewish faith by revoking the excommunication of richard williamson , a holocaust-denying bishop of an arch-conservative catholic group .
" pope benedict xvi seriously angered many faithful catholics and suffered a severe loss of his credibility .
this is sad , " kueng said .
the pope should state that the revoking williamson 's excommunication without conditions has not been justified , kueng demanded .
kueng 's remarks have prompted fierce criticism by the vatican .
cardinal angelo sodano , dean of the college of cardinals at the vatican rejected kueng 's criticism , calling it " bitter " and " hurtful " and said it did n't promote the unity of the church . nda / sp / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opel could be lined up for temporary state aid the german government is debating whether to help ailing carmaker opel after us parent company general motors said it planned to spin off its german arm which needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to survive . german chancellor angela merkel on saturday , feb 28 , reacted cautiously to calls for her government to prop up stricken automaker opel .
speaking at a meeting of her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the northern city of kiel , merkel said her government would need to carefully examine an opel rescue plan outlined by us parent company general motors before a decision on a bail-out could be taken .
the chancellor , whose government has passed a major bailout package for banks and two economic stimulus plans worth billions , said there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
it needs to be ascertained whether a company 's troubles are triggered by the global financial crisis and whether it can continue to operate strongly in the long-term , the chancellor said .
earlier , german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg discussed opel 's future with the premiers of the four states where opel plants are located .
the talks served to " explore various plans of action , " according to the minister .
he added that the discussion would intensify once opel revealed exact details of its rescue plan .
opel needs billions to survive on friday , the head of gm europe , carl-peter forster , said opel needed 3.3 billion euros in aid to survive and to aviod job cuts and closures .
he also said the german carmaker would be split off into a seperate unit .
speaking at a press conference at opel 's headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim , forster said general motors europe would present the rescue plan to german authorities on monday .
he added that the plan it included 3.0 billion euros from gm itself along with around one billion euros in cost savings .
" we need all three parts of the plan " to ensure its success , forster said .
he added that opel would repay any state aid by 2014-2015 , but said that " as a result of the automobile market crisis we are now in a very tough situation . "
opel looking to break from gm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel could break from gm after 80 years of marriage opel 's activities would be regrouped within an independent unit as part of the plan , forster said , adding that no decisions had been taken yet regarding possible plant closures .
" but it is a fact that we find ourselves in an exceptional economic situation and that we will eventually have to consider closing sites , " he said .
press reports have said that an opel factory in the western city of bochum is threatened and that another in eastern eisenach might be sold .
opel itself must remain a part of gm , though its capital could be opened up to third parties or partnerships could be created , forster said .
the rescue plan was required by german authorities before any public aid would be granted to opel , which has been hit by a global auto slump and massive financial problems at gm .
gm europe works committee chief klaus franz told media that opel should be transformed into a european company , or sa , which would allow the participation of outside investors .
" after 80 years , gm is prepared to cede parts of opel , " franz said .
he called the management 's plan " very viable " and said it had been approved by workers ' representatives .
government to analyze opel situation monday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg will discuss plans for opel next week general motors is not in much of a position to help its german subsidiary , after posting a loss of more than $ 30 billion in 2008 .
meanwhile , other reports said opel and german car manufacturer daimler , maker of mercedes-benz autos , were in negotiations over the possible sale of one of opel 's factories .
opel 's plant in the central city of eisenach might could go to the luxury car maker , resulting in the construction of a new mercedes factory in hungary " possibly being abandoned , " the thueringer allgemeine newspaper said .
the company was examining " to what extent the hungarian project could be stopped , " sources said .
daimler said last year october it would build the factory in hungary at a cost of about 800 million euros to boost production of smaller models . nda / sp / afpr / rtrs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not want any new dividing lines ; we do not want a europe divided along a north-south or an east-west line ; pursuing a beggar-thy-neighbor policy is unacceptable , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is to chair the meeting as current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the eve of the summit . the informal meeting of the leaders of the eu 's 27 member states is officially set to discuss the bloc 's response to the deepening economic crisis .
it is the fourth full summit to focus on that subject since october . but the summit 's preparations were marred by a bitter row between the czech republic and france - the previous holder of the presidency - after french president nicolas sarkozy criticized french car makers who had shifted production to central europe and said french auto companies should give priority to french workers . protectionist policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek wants europe to act together the czech republic , which has become a major production center for the automotive industry and has seen sizeable investments from french car firms , attacked those demands as protectionist . prague responded by saying that sunday 's summit should focus on rejecting protectionism .
sarkozy said that it should rather aim at reviving the market for inter-bank lending , seen as a key to ending the ongoing financial crisis . diplomatic sources told the dpa news agency that sarkozy and topolanek were to meet in private immediately before sunday 's meeting in a bid to resolve their differences . on saturday , the european commission , the eu 's executive , said that france had dropped plans to fund the country 's car makers on condition that they give preferential treatment to french plants and suppliers , in a move seen as likely to ease tensions . " in particular , the loan agreements with manufacturers would not contain any condition regarding either the location of their activities or a preference for france-based suppliers , " a commission statement said . european cliques trouble also flared ahead of the summit after germany hosted a meeting of the european members of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies - britain , france , germany and italy - on february 22 . spain and the netherlands were also invited to the meeting , which was meant to pave the way for a g20 summit in london on april 2 . but the inclusion of the two non-members infuriated countries such as poland , finland and sweden , who saw it as a snub and warned that such actions risked breaking the eu up into cliques . on sunday morning , poland is to host in brussels a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's nine members from central and eastern europe . diplomats from the countries involved say the meeting is routine . germany takes lead in calling for cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mergel is calling for urgent action german chancellor merkel urged the eu states to work together to tackle the global economic downturn . " we should keep in mind that the economic crisis emerged out of a massive financial crisis , " merkel told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" the european union must work together on making sure that something like that does n't happen again , and we need to act urgently . " with germany , europe 's biggest economy , facing its worst recession since world war ii , merkel has long called for greater oversight of financial markets , increased transparency and tougher regulations for hedge funds , rating agencies and corporate bonus structures . " we need a global financial architecture that is transparent , " merkel said .

three of them in fact , taking commands in german from trainer lars holsher .
they will back up for him , lift one leg , take a bow and walk out trunk-linked-to-tail .
two asian and an african elephant sonja , delhi and vana mana make their debut in ring tonight .
they have the local vicar 's blessing , who performed a short service in the sawdust-covered ring this morning , but not the rspca 's .
their spokesman rob atkinson told the bbc : " it 's a freezing cold february day for a start , these are tropical animals , and they do n't like in groups of mixed species .
the public want to see performing animals as long as they can see they 're happy and well looked after chris barltrop , great british circus " for african elephants that 's completely unnatural .
they 're not related , which all elephant herds are .
they stay with each other for their whole lives .
" they spend and walk 12km to try and find food , they socialise , they can recognise the calls of 200 other animals , they have a concept of death and mourning and they do n't have the chance to do any of that there . "
of the uk 's 30 travelling circuses , most have dropped performing exotic animals from their line-ups .
welfare and ethical concerns have led many local councils not allowing them on their land .
the great british circus is the biggest , with big cats including lions and tigers , camels , horses and llamas lining up alongside the elephants , clowns , acrobats and the usual crop of human circus performers .
spokesman chris barltrop says it has a clean bill of health from a government-appointed vet and nothing to hide .
" the public want to see performing animals as long as they can see they 're happy and well looked after , " he said .
' sad sight ' " and what we 're doing with this group of elephants is setting an example of how animals can be looked after in this context . "
there were mixed views from people in newark , some thinking it was sad people still want to see wild animals performing in the ring , and unnatural that they should be doing tricks .
others thought there was nothing wrong with circus animals so long as they were well looked after .
the great british circus hopes having the elephants on the bill will be a big draw .
opponents like the rspca say it 's a body blow to their campaign to get this type of act off the bill .
the charity renewed its call on the government today to ban wild animals from being allowed to perform in the uk .
the circus meanwhile , says it 's happy to jump through hoops to convince the authorities and the paying public their animals are well looked after .
a test of that will come over the next fortnight here in newark with how many tickets they sell .
