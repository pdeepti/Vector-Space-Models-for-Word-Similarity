despite measures to abolish slavery worldwide , human trafficking and forced labour remain very evident across the globe .
poor people , who come to foreign countries in search of a better life , are the most vulnerable .
christina from myanmar is one of the many who have been subjected to human rights violations . in the fall of 2003 , christina came to the us with new dreams in her eyes .
in her country myanmar , she saw little hope .
as a member of the indian minority community and as a christian in a predominantly buddhist country , she often felt like an outsider .
her success at school was the only respite to compensate for the discrimination she was experiencing almost everyday .
then she got admission into an american university .
a future full of hopes for her .
“ i knew that i was going to do well in the school , ” she says .
“ i was 19 and i had plans to finish school in four years , go on peace corps , help out people , and come back , do my graduate school .
so i had my life planned out already ahead of time . ”
turn of events but her life changed soon .
from a confident student , she became a victim of economic exploitation .
she had to work at her aunt ’ s restaurant in the us .
“ for about a month , life was good .
and then it started changing gradually , " says christina .
“ i was pressured into doing a lot of things that i didn ’ t want to do .
first of all , i worked for her business , so i was i already spending time outside the house with her , for her and then i would come home and put up with the family , having to take care of all the chores and things around .
it was like 24/7 .
i was a slave . ”
christina did not resist .
her cultural background demanded an unconditional obedience to elders .
forced labour for the university , she had less and less time .
and because her aunt ’ s restaurant was not running well , she had no money for her tuition fees either .
as a result , christina had to stop her studies .
with this , she automatically lost her residence permit and was forced into staying illegally in the united states .
she was now completely dependent on her aunt : “ i would get up around 6 , sometimes 7 , if i was very tired .
i 'd spend an hour on the road just to get to the restaurant , just to make sure that everything was ok before we opened and then go back in the kitchen and then start cooking and cleaning without a break .
i mean i would stop to eat but that ’ s pretty much all i had . ”
verbal and physical abuse the other employees at the restaurant were given a proper wage .
but christina didn ’ t even get a cent .
instead , she was assaulted verbally and at times physically .
amid fear of deportation , she did not know whom she could turn to for help .
she might have continued to work for her aunt , until one night , when her drunken uncle became too intrusive .
in panic and fear christina grabbed her belongings and left the house .
help from an organisation she was fortunate .
her immediate neighbour helped her and brought her into contact with the relief organization , " break the chain campaign " , where she got legal advice and help .
qimmah najeeullah , the director of the organization , explains : “ i think we all underestimate the power of the psychological version .
often times the trafficker or the employers explain the world to be really different than what it really is .
they will say : you see all the violence in the news .
oh !
that could be you . and it is natural for you to want to be in an environment that is safe .
and if you know it is an abuse and it is a limitation , it is still more comfortable than what you don ’ t know . ”
as a victim of trafficking christina was actually entitled to a so-called t-visa which could have legalised her stay in the u.s. but she refused to take it , as this could have meant that she stood as a witness against her aunt .
she is now married to a us citizen and is a green card holder .
she is also looking forward to her return to university .

despite measures to abolish slavery worldwide , human trafficking and forced labour remain very evident across the globe .
poor people , who come to foreign countries in search of a better life , are the most vulnerable .
christina from myanmar is one of the many who have been subjected to human rights violations . in the fall of 2003 , christina came to the us with new dreams in her eyes .
in her country myanmar , she saw little hope .
as a member of the indian minority community and as a christian in a predominantly buddhist country , she often felt like an outsider .
her success at school was the only respite to compensate for the discrimination she was experiencing almost everyday .
then she got admission into an american university .
a future full of hopes for her .
“ i knew that i was going to do well in the school , ” she says .
“ i was 19 and i had plans to finish school in four years , go on peace corps , help out people , and come back , do my graduate school .
so i had my life planned out already ahead of time . ”
turn of events but her life changed soon .
from a confident student , she became a victim of economic exploitation .
she had to work at her aunt ’ s restaurant in the us .
“ for about a month , life was good .
and then it started changing gradually , " says christina .
“ i was pressured into doing a lot of things that i didn ’ t want to do .
first of all , i worked for her business , so i was i already spending time outside the house with her , for her and then i would come home and put up with the family , having to take care of all the chores and things around .
it was like 24/7 .
i was a slave . ”
christina did not resist .
her cultural background demanded an unconditional obedience to elders .
forced labour for the university , she had less and less time .
and because her aunt ’ s restaurant was not running well , she had no money for her tuition fees either .
as a result , christina had to stop her studies .
with this , she automatically lost her residence permit and was forced into staying illegally in the united states .
she was now completely dependent on her aunt : “ i would get up around 6 , sometimes 7 , if i was very tired .
i 'd spend an hour on the road just to get to the restaurant , just to make sure that everything was ok before we opened and then go back in the kitchen and then start cooking and cleaning without a break .
i mean i would stop to eat but that ’ s pretty much all i had . ”
verbal and physical abuse the other employees at the restaurant were given a proper wage .
but christina didn ’ t even get a cent .
instead , she was assaulted verbally and at times physically .
amid fear of deportation , she did not know whom she could turn to for help .
she might have continued to work for her aunt , until one night , when her drunken uncle became too intrusive .
in panic and fear christina grabbed her belongings and left the house .
help from an organisation she was fortunate .
her immediate neighbour helped her and brought her into contact with the relief organization , " break the chain campaign " , where she got legal advice and help .
qimmah najeeullah , the director of the organization , explains : “ i think we all underestimate the power of the psychological version .
often times the trafficker or the employers explain the world to be really different than what it really is .
they will say : you see all the violence in the news .
oh !
that could be you . and it is natural for you to want to be in an environment that is safe .
and if you know it is an abuse and it is a limitation , it is still more comfortable than what you don ’ t know . ”
as a victim of trafficking christina was actually entitled to a so-called t-visa which could have legalised her stay in the u.s. but she refused to take it , as this could have meant that she stood as a witness against her aunt .
she is now married to a us citizen and is a green card holder .
she is also looking forward to her return to university .

" despite receiving some 10.6 million euros of funding from the federal and two state governments , the array 's potential will likely not be realized in germany , but in sunnier regions closer to the equator , thoben said . german environment minister sigmar gabriel added that the new solar project would help solidify germany 's expertise in the renewable energy market .

access is granted via application . wwii restitution an issue art theft is a worldwide problem ; in germany , stories of art theft often center around art that was looted from its owners amid the oppression and chaos of world war ii . during that time , " a relocation of cultural items took place whose full scope has still not been completely explored and investigated , " according to the coordination office for lost cultural assets , located in magdeburg . the nazis , the soviet trophy commissions , and individual allied military personnel all perpetrated art theft .
artworks and artifacts were also removed or relocated to protect them during wartime and are now located on foreign territory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a public database , art buyers ca n't claim ignorance in june , 46 countries signed the terezin declaration , vowing to increase their efforts to return more of the estimated 650,000 works of art stolen from european jews during the holocaust . the new interpol database could be of help in the search for these and other objects stolen in any of the agency 's 187 member countries . the information in the database will consist of descriptions and photographs of stolen cultural goods , according to karl hein kind , who coordinates the works of art department of interpol based in lyon , france . ' a barrier for traffickers ' contribution and access to the database represents " an important tool to counter the traffic in cultural property effectively , " kind said . all of interpol 's member countries will contribute information , he added . the agency hopes that by opening up access to the database to the public and to concerned cultural and professional bodies such as ministries of culture , museums , auction houses , art galleries , foundations , and collectors , it will be that much more difficult for a seller or purchaser to claim not having had the opportunity to check whether an item was recorded as stolen . " extensive online access to the database -lrb- … -rrb- represents an important barrier to the illicit trafficking of a stolen cultural object by making its sale more difficult , " kind said . victorine stille works for the art loss register , an international company that also keeps an online database of stolen art .
their company also keeps a database of stolen goods , and takes a fee for checking on the provenance of artworks - for buyers who want to be sure about their art investments , for example . she agrees on the importance of transparency when it comes to stolen art , and welcomes the presence of another international art register . " the art loss register has always worked very closely with interpol and other police agencies , " stille said . " both of our aims is to solve art crimes ... interpol is helping to create public awareness of the problem .
its good that they 've made the database available to everyone because now people ca n't hide anymore by saying ' oh , we did n't know .

dw 's sabina matthay examines how free and fair the elections actually were . almost defiantly , the afghan foreign ministry declared that election day was a success .
indeed , there are some who say the events could pass as a trial run for democracy , as a step toward real democratic change , peace and prosperity .
on the surface it may have been a day to remember : in many provinces and towns voters lined up to elect a new president , defying the taliban and others who are so intent on destabilizing the country .
a wonderful image that was pounced on by the government , which had even attempted to impose a blackout on media coverage of violence and intimidation .
however , it was a different story in many other areas , the city of kunduz in particular was targeted relentlessly by taliban rocket attacks and at least five people were hurt there on election day .
then there are the figures : 200,000 afghan and 100,000 international security forces were dispatched to protect the polling stations - hardly the sign of a normal election day , and if those numbers ultimately fail to provide adequate security , the situation becomes even more farcical .
the violence has also overshadowed another danger overshadowing these polls , namely fraud and vote rigging .
many polling stations were forced to stay shut , not only those in the taliban-dominated south .
others may have opened , however election observers were not granted access - thus it 's almost impossible to know what happened at those polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been wide-spread allegations of vote rigging there was evidence of fraud at the last presidential election in 2004 , this time observers say the vote rigging was systematic .
it has been widely reported that incumbent - and unpopular - leader hamid karzai has absolutely no interest in being forced into a run-off poll , which could see him defeated .
as always these allegations are based on rumors and counter-rumors , however the very fact that the electoral commission , tasked with guaranteeing a free and fair poll , sent out thousands of election documents to children ineligible to vote highlights the lack of transparency and fairness , and further undermines any confidence in the government .
should these allegations be confirmed , it could spell the beginning of the end for a democratically-rooted afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.08.2009 graphics will take a backseat to game design , story großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the games developers conference and gamescom gave players a chance to see upcoming titles the electronic entertainment industry 's heavyweights showed off their shiniest toys at the games developers conference in cologne .
soothsayers of the business also tried to predict the future of gaming technology . cologne is hosting the games developers conference , an industry-insider conference which ended on wednesday , and gamescom , a massive public celebration of electronic entertainment , through sunday .
one of germany 's biggest game developers , frankfurt-based crytek was there hawking its new cryengine3 software development toolset .
crytek is best known for its non-linear game-play and graphically intense action games such as " farcry " and " crysis . "
even as console gaming platforms like the xbox 360 and playstation3 have proven themselves software-selling juggernauts , the gaming industry will have to stop focusing purely on graphics to be successful , according to crytek founder cevat yerli .
building a better game video gaming graphics advances are effectively stalled for the next three years , yerli said , as maximum screen resolution is tied to the gaming console development cycle .
that means developers will have to find other ways to grab gamers ' interest .
until 2012 , crytek will rely on improving artificial intelligence , physics and special effects in order to differentiate itself from other games developers , he said .
" the online gaming market is growing fast , " said patrick lehrmann , a project manager for games academy , a school for game developers .
" and this market is not about graphics .
it 's going to be absolutely about game design . " "
instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 . " this will be a first person shooter , somewhat akin to the games that crytek has made such a name for itself in producing . but ccp is taking this model a step further . dust 514 will be a console multiplayer game , which will take place within the well-established universe of eve online . " we 're creating an fps with consequences and benefits for gamers ' actions , " richardsson said .
first person shooters tend to boast impressive graphics , and from the video ccp showed at the game 's announcement , dust will be no exception , but behind the surface of the game they plan to implement further layers of robust design .
the battles won or lost in dust will impact the eve universe and vice versa , and ccp hopes that cooperative alliances will emerge between players in the two linked games . good looks are hard to believe while games developers will always strive to look good , there are some who are re-thinking the often superficial approach to game development , such as crytek 's yerli .
" it 's better to create a believable world than a realistic world , " yerli said in an interview with deutsche welle , saying that it 's best to back away from attempting photo-realism and to create worlds that capture gamers ' attention .
most people ca n't tell the difference between the graphics in a game from seven years ago and a game from last year , lehrmann said , but they know when a game they play is well designed .
" they can recognize how beautiful the work is that went into it , " he said .

soothsayers of the business also tried to predict the future of gaming technology . cologne is hosting the games developers conference , an industry-insider conference which ended on wednesday , and gamescom , a massive public celebration of electronic entertainment , through sunday .
one of germany 's biggest game developers , frankfurt-based crytek was there hawking its new cryengine3 software development toolset .
crytek is best known for its non-linear game-play and graphically intense action games such as " farcry " and " crysis . "
even as console gaming platforms like the xbox 360 and playstation3 have proven themselves software-selling juggernauts , the gaming industry will have to stop focusing purely on graphics to be successful , according to crytek founder cevat yerli .
building a better game video gaming graphics advances are effectively stalled for the next three years , yerli said , as maximum screen resolution is tied to the gaming console development cycle .
that means developers will have to find other ways to grab gamers ' interest .
until 2012 , crytek will rely on improving artificial intelligence , physics and special effects in order to differentiate itself from other games developers , he said .
" the online gaming market is growing fast , " said patrick lehrmann , a project manager for games academy , a school for game developers .
" and this market is not about graphics .
it 's going to be absolutely about game design . " "
instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 . " this will be a first person shooter , somewhat akin to the games that crytek has made such a name for itself in producing . but ccp is taking this model a step further . dust 514 will be a console multiplayer game , which will take place within the well-established universe of eve online . " we 're creating an fps with consequences and benefits for gamers ' actions , " richardsson said .
first person shooters tend to boast impressive graphics , and from the video ccp showed at the game 's announcement , dust will be no exception , but behind the surface of the game they plan to implement further layers of robust design .
the battles won or lost in dust will impact the eve universe and vice versa , and ccp hopes that cooperative alliances will emerge between players in the two linked games . good looks are hard to believe while games developers will always strive to look good , there are some who are re-thinking the often superficial approach to game development , such as crytek 's yerli .
" it 's better to create a believable world than a realistic world , " yerli said in an interview with deutsche welle , saying that it 's best to back away from attempting photo-realism and to create worlds that capture gamers ' attention .
most people ca n't tell the difference between the graphics in a game from seven years ago and a game from last year , lehrmann said , but they know when a game they play is well designed .
" they can recognize how beautiful the work is that went into it , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 21.08.2009 germany alone in struggle against google books as france gets onboard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is n't the only organization to digitalize books , but some say it claims a monopoly france 's national library is negotiating with google over participating in the firm 's digital book project .
that leaves germany as a lone voice against the " monopolization " and " americanization " of european culture . paris ' bibliotheque nationale de france -lrb- bnf -rrb- said thursday that it is in talks with google over the possibility of allowing the california-based internet giant to scan a portion of its 30 million books and documents , making them available free of charge on the internet . thirty libraries , including renowned university institutions at harvard , princeton and oxford , are already involved in the project , which aims to digitalize both out-of-print books as well as publications that are currently on the market . germany rejects google plan if the influential bnf reaches an agreement with google , it would mean a significant blow to the german government 's adamant stance against the book search project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has said it intends to scan only excerpts of books currently on the market " i have protested against google and will continue to do so , as long as copyrighted works are scanned without the prior approval of the author , " bernd neumann , germany 's minister of culture , said thursday . in the us , google has reached a legal agreement with publishing houses , according to which they receive a lump sum for the books offered up for scanning .
the authors themselves are not consulted . also on thursday , the german publishers and booksellers association issued a statement welcoming the digitalization of copyright-free material .
however , it criticized the european commission and the major participating eu states for supporting the google project . " states are being negligent with their cultural heritage when they turn it over to a monopolist and thereby run tax-funded projects like the european digital library europeana into the ground , " said alexander skipis , the association 's director . brussels gives its blessing launched in november 2008 , the europeana digital library offers users access to some two million digital objects including film material , photos , maps , books , newspapers and other documents . eu commissioner for information , society and media , vivane reding , told german daily handelsblatt that 90 percent of all archived books worldwide were no longer in print and therefore not accessible to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bavarian state library is the only one in germany to make a deal with google " it 's good that new business models are developed to bring this content to the consumers , " said reding , adding that digitalization was an expensive undertaking that could n't be borne by governments alone . french library reconsiders the bnf has a digitalization project of its own , with 100,000 books and rare documents being scanned each year over a course of three years .
these are available on the french web site gallica . in 2005 , bnf 's director at the time , jean-noel jeanneney , was adamantly opposed to the budding google project , which he viewed as the americanization of european culture . though the german government is unyielding in its opposition to the mass digitalization endeavor , one library in germany - the bavarian state library in munich - has signed a contract with google . france 's change of heart on the matter is another thorn in the side of germany 's ministry of culture . kjb / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that leaves germany as a lone voice against the " monopolization " and " americanization " of european culture . paris ' bibliotheque nationale de france -lrb- bnf -rrb- said thursday that it is in talks with google over the possibility of allowing the california-based internet giant to scan a portion of its 30 million books and documents , making them available free of charge on the internet . thirty libraries , including renowned university institutions at harvard , princeton and oxford , are already involved in the project , which aims to digitalize both out-of-print books as well as publications that are currently on the market . germany rejects google plan if the influential bnf reaches an agreement with google , it would mean a significant blow to the german government 's adamant stance against the book search project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has said it intends to scan only excerpts of books currently on the market " i have protested against google and will continue to do so , as long as copyrighted works are scanned without the prior approval of the author , " bernd neumann , germany 's minister of culture , said thursday . in the us , google has reached a legal agreement with publishing houses , according to which they receive a lump sum for the books offered up for scanning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.08.2009 graphics will take a backseat to game design , story großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the games developers conference and gamescom gave players a chance to see upcoming titles the electronic entertainment industry 's heavyweights showed off their shiniest toys at the games developers conference in cologne .
soothsayers of the business also tried to predict the future of gaming technology . cologne is hosting the games developers conference , an industry-insider conference which ended on wednesday , and gamescom , a massive public celebration of electronic entertainment , through sunday .
one of germany 's biggest game developers , frankfurt-based crytek was there hawking its new cryengine3 software development toolset .
crytek is best known for its non-linear game-play and graphically intense action games such as " farcry " and " crysis . "
even as console gaming platforms like the xbox 360 and playstation3 have proven themselves software-selling juggernauts , the gaming industry will have to stop focusing purely on graphics to be successful , according to crytek founder cevat yerli .
building a better game video gaming graphics advances are effectively stalled for the next three years , yerli said , as maximum screen resolution is tied to the gaming console development cycle .
that means developers will have to find other ways to grab gamers ' interest .
until 2012 , crytek will rely on improving artificial intelligence , physics and special effects in order to differentiate itself from other games developers , he said .
" the online gaming market is growing fast , " said patrick lehrmann , a project manager for games academy , a school for game developers .
" and this market is not about graphics .
it 's going to be absolutely about game design . " "
instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 . " this will be a first person shooter , somewhat akin to the games that crytek has made such a name for itself in producing . but ccp is taking this model a step further . dust 514 will be a console multiplayer game , which will take place within the well-established universe of eve online . " we 're creating an fps with consequences and benefits for gamers ' actions , " richardsson said .
first person shooters tend to boast impressive graphics , and from the video ccp showed at the game 's announcement , dust will be no exception , but behind the surface of the game they plan to implement further layers of robust design .
the battles won or lost in dust will impact the eve universe and vice versa , and ccp hopes that cooperative alliances will emerge between players in the two linked games . good looks are hard to believe while games developers will always strive to look good , there are some who are re-thinking the often superficial approach to game development , such as crytek 's yerli .
" it 's better to create a believable world than a realistic world , " yerli said in an interview with deutsche welle , saying that it 's best to back away from attempting photo-realism and to create worlds that capture gamers ' attention .
most people ca n't tell the difference between the graphics in a game from seven years ago and a game from last year , lehrmann said , but they know when a game they play is well designed .
" they can recognize how beautiful the work is that went into it , " he said .

dw 's sabina matthay examines how free and fair the elections actually were . almost defiantly , the afghan foreign ministry declared that election day was a success .
indeed , there are some who say the events could pass as a trial run for democracy , as a step toward real democratic change , peace and prosperity .
on the surface it may have been a day to remember : in many provinces and towns voters lined up to elect a new president , defying the taliban and others who are so intent on destabilizing the country .
a wonderful image that was pounced on by the government , which had even attempted to impose a blackout on media coverage of violence and intimidation .
however , it was a different story in many other areas , the city of kunduz in particular was targeted relentlessly by taliban rocket attacks and at least five people were hurt there on election day .
then there are the figures : 200,000 afghan and 100,000 international security forces were dispatched to protect the polling stations - hardly the sign of a normal election day , and if those numbers ultimately fail to provide adequate security , the situation becomes even more farcical .
the violence has also overshadowed another danger overshadowing these polls , namely fraud and vote rigging .
many polling stations were forced to stay shut , not only those in the taliban-dominated south .
others may have opened , however election observers were not granted access - thus it 's almost impossible to know what happened at those polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been wide-spread allegations of vote rigging there was evidence of fraud at the last presidential election in 2004 , this time observers say the vote rigging was systematic .
it has been widely reported that incumbent - and unpopular - leader hamid karzai has absolutely no interest in being forced into a run-off poll , which could see him defeated .
as always these allegations are based on rumors and counter-rumors , however the very fact that the electoral commission , tasked with guaranteeing a free and fair poll , sent out thousands of election documents to children ineligible to vote highlights the lack of transparency and fairness , and further undermines any confidence in the government .
should these allegations be confirmed , it could spell the beginning of the end for a democratically-rooted afghanistan .

access is granted via application . wwii restitution an issue art theft is a worldwide problem ; in germany , stories of art theft often center around art that was looted from its owners amid the oppression and chaos of world war ii . during that time , " a relocation of cultural items took place whose full scope has still not been completely explored and investigated , " according to the coordination office for lost cultural assets , located in magdeburg . the nazis , the soviet trophy commissions , and individual allied military personnel all perpetrated art theft .
artworks and artifacts were also removed or relocated to protect them during wartime and are now located on foreign territory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a public database , art buyers ca n't claim ignorance in june , 46 countries signed the terezin declaration , vowing to increase their efforts to return more of the estimated 650,000 works of art stolen from european jews during the holocaust . the new interpol database could be of help in the search for these and other objects stolen in any of the agency 's 187 member countries . the information in the database will consist of descriptions and photographs of stolen cultural goods , according to karl hein kind , who coordinates the works of art department of interpol based in lyon , france . ' a barrier for traffickers ' contribution and access to the database represents " an important tool to counter the traffic in cultural property effectively , " kind said . all of interpol 's member countries will contribute information , he added . the agency hopes that by opening up access to the database to the public and to concerned cultural and professional bodies such as ministries of culture , museums , auction houses , art galleries , foundations , and collectors , it will be that much more difficult for a seller or purchaser to claim not having had the opportunity to check whether an item was recorded as stolen . " extensive online access to the database -lrb- … -rrb- represents an important barrier to the illicit trafficking of a stolen cultural object by making its sale more difficult , " kind said . victorine stille works for the art loss register , an international company that also keeps an online database of stolen art .
their company also keeps a database of stolen goods , and takes a fee for checking on the provenance of artworks - for buyers who want to be sure about their art investments , for example . she agrees on the importance of transparency when it comes to stolen art , and welcomes the presence of another international art register . " the art loss register has always worked very closely with interpol and other police agencies , " stille said . " both of our aims is to solve art crimes ... interpol is helping to create public awareness of the problem .
its good that they 've made the database available to everyone because now people ca n't hide anymore by saying ' oh , we did n't know .

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .
" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .
the nigerian missed training on wednesday with a cold , but is expected to recover by sunday , probably to take a place on the bench .
bayern looking for first win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is frustrated by his team 's sluggish start bayern munich , meanwhile , will be looking for a first victory after two draws under dutch coach louis van gaal when they travel to promoted mainz on saturday .
van gaal will be without the injured martin demichelis in defense and captain mark van bommel in midfield , but is hoping french international franck ribery will be available .
ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .
the arrival of gomez and olic seems to have relegated toni to the bench but chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has warned against writing off the 32-year-old .
" he is mentally strong and i am convinced that after returning from italy he will be training hard and working on his comeback .
i think we 'll still have a lot of fun with him in munich , " he said .
basement battlers looking for first points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince poldi 's return to cologne has not been a happy one at the other end of the table the arrival of striker lukas podolski from bayern has not translated to points for cologne who are bottom following two defeats ahead of saturday 's visit by eintracht frankfurt .
cologne will feel it 's a must-win game as tough matches follow against hamburg , schalke , stuttgart , bayer leverkusen and bayern munich .
" we have to stay calm and not get hectic .
we have shown that we can match opponents like wolfsburg -lrb- a 3-1 home defeat -rrb- .
but the two first games have shown that it 's going to be a tough season , " podolski told kicker sports magazine .
hanover , who visit nuremberg on saturday , are also looking for a first win as well as a new coach after dieter hecking threw in the towel late wednesday .
werder bremen - boosted by the signing of last season 's on-loan striker claudio pizarro - are another side seeking a first win , with borussia moenchengladbach the visitors on sunday .
borussia dortmund and stuttgart - both fancied to do well this season - meet on saturday , while leverkusen are at promoted freiburg in the day 's other game .

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .
" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .
the nigerian missed training on wednesday with a cold , but is expected to recover by sunday , probably to take a place on the bench .
bayern looking for first win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is frustrated by his team 's sluggish start bayern munich , meanwhile , will be looking for a first victory after two draws under dutch coach louis van gaal when they travel to promoted mainz on saturday .
van gaal will be without the injured martin demichelis in defense and captain mark van bommel in midfield , but is hoping french international franck ribery will be available .
ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .
the arrival of gomez and olic seems to have relegated toni to the bench but chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has warned against writing off the 32-year-old .
" he is mentally strong and i am convinced that after returning from italy he will be training hard and working on his comeback .
i think we 'll still have a lot of fun with him in munich , " he said .
basement battlers looking for first points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince poldi 's return to cologne has not been a happy one at the other end of the table the arrival of striker lukas podolski from bayern has not translated to points for cologne who are bottom following two defeats ahead of saturday 's visit by eintracht frankfurt .
cologne will feel it 's a must-win game as tough matches follow against hamburg , schalke , stuttgart , bayer leverkusen and bayern munich .
" we have to stay calm and not get hectic .
we have shown that we can match opponents like wolfsburg -lrb- a 3-1 home defeat -rrb- .
but the two first games have shown that it 's going to be a tough season , " podolski told kicker sports magazine .
hanover , who visit nuremberg on saturday , are also looking for a first win as well as a new coach after dieter hecking threw in the towel late wednesday .
werder bremen - boosted by the signing of last season 's on-loan striker claudio pizarro - are another side seeking a first win , with borussia moenchengladbach the visitors on sunday .
borussia dortmund and stuttgart - both fancied to do well this season - meet on saturday , while leverkusen are at promoted freiburg in the day 's other game .

no other country has ever swept the world championship or olympic race walking events .
50 kilometer-winner kirdyapkin says his victory was revenge for his wife 's defeat in the 20 kilometer race . russia became the first country ever to win all three race walking events in world championship or olympic competition on friday .
2005 world champion sergey kirdyapkin 's come-from-behind win completed the sweep when he finished the men 's 50 kilometer walking event in 3 hours , 38 minutes and 35 seconds . valeriy borchin and olga kaniskina won the men 's and women 's 20 kilometer events , respectively .
kirdyapkin , 29 , credited his win in part to support he got from off the track : a message from his wife , anisya kirdyapkina , who narrowly missed out on the bronze medal during the women 's walking event on august 16 .
" i got an sms from my wife this morning and she asked me to take revenge .
and that 's what happened , " kirdyapkin said .

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .
" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .
the nigerian missed training on wednesday with a cold , but is expected to recover by sunday , probably to take a place on the bench .
bayern looking for first win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is frustrated by his team 's sluggish start bayern munich , meanwhile , will be looking for a first victory after two draws under dutch coach louis van gaal when they travel to promoted mainz on saturday .
van gaal will be without the injured martin demichelis in defense and captain mark van bommel in midfield , but is hoping french international franck ribery will be available .
ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .
" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .

van gaal will be without the injured martin demichelis in defense and captain mark van bommel in midfield , but is hoping french international franck ribery will be available .
ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .
" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .
the nigerian missed training on wednesday with a cold , but is expected to recover by sunday , probably to take a place on the bench .
bayern looking for first win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is frustrated by his team 's sluggish start bayern munich , meanwhile , will be looking for a first victory after two draws under dutch coach louis van gaal when they travel to promoted mainz on saturday .
van gaal will be without the injured martin demichelis in defense and captain mark van bommel in midfield , but is hoping french international franck ribery will be available .
ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .
the arrival of gomez and olic seems to have relegated toni to the bench but chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has warned against writing off the 32-year-old .
" he is mentally strong and i am convinced that after returning from italy he will be training hard and working on his comeback .
i think we 'll still have a lot of fun with him in munich , " he said .
basement battlers looking for first points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince poldi 's return to cologne has not been a happy one at the other end of the table the arrival of striker lukas podolski from bayern has not translated to points for cologne who are bottom following two defeats ahead of saturday 's visit by eintracht frankfurt .
cologne will feel it 's a must-win game as tough matches follow against hamburg , schalke , stuttgart , bayer leverkusen and bayern munich .
" we have to stay calm and not get hectic .
we have shown that we can match opponents like wolfsburg -lrb- a 3-1 home defeat -rrb- .
but the two first games have shown that it 's going to be a tough season , " podolski told kicker sports magazine .
hanover , who visit nuremberg on saturday , are also looking for a first win as well as a new coach after dieter hecking threw in the towel late wednesday .
werder bremen - boosted by the signing of last season 's on-loan striker claudio pizarro - are another side seeking a first win , with borussia moenchengladbach the visitors on sunday .
borussia dortmund and stuttgart - both fancied to do well this season - meet on saturday , while leverkusen are at promoted freiburg in the day 's other game .

dw 's sabina matthay examines how free and fair the elections actually were . almost defiantly , the afghan foreign ministry declared that election day was a success .
indeed , there are some who say the events could pass as a trial run for democracy , as a step toward real democratic change , peace and prosperity .
on the surface it may have been a day to remember : in many provinces and towns voters lined up to elect a new president , defying the taliban and others who are so intent on destabilizing the country .
a wonderful image that was pounced on by the government , which had even attempted to impose a blackout on media coverage of violence and intimidation .
however , it was a different story in many other areas , the city of kunduz in particular was targeted relentlessly by taliban rocket attacks and at least five people were hurt there on election day .
then there are the figures : 200,000 afghan and 100,000 international security forces were dispatched to protect the polling stations - hardly the sign of a normal election day , and if those numbers ultimately fail to provide adequate security , the situation becomes even more farcical .
the violence has also overshadowed another danger overshadowing these polls , namely fraud and vote rigging .
many polling stations were forced to stay shut , not only those in the taliban-dominated south .
others may have opened , however election observers were not granted access - thus it 's almost impossible to know what happened at those polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been wide-spread allegations of vote rigging there was evidence of fraud at the last presidential election in 2004 , this time observers say the vote rigging was systematic .
it has been widely reported that incumbent - and unpopular - leader hamid karzai has absolutely no interest in being forced into a run-off poll , which could see him defeated .
as always these allegations are based on rumors and counter-rumors , however the very fact that the electoral commission , tasked with guaranteeing a free and fair poll , sent out thousands of election documents to children ineligible to vote highlights the lack of transparency and fairness , and further undermines any confidence in the government .
should these allegations be confirmed , it could spell the beginning of the end for a democratically-rooted afghanistan .

dw 's sabina matthay examines how free and fair the elections actually were . almost defiantly , the afghan foreign ministry declared that election day was a success .
indeed , there are some who say the events could pass as a trial run for democracy , as a step toward real democratic change , peace and prosperity .
on the surface it may have been a day to remember : in many provinces and towns voters lined up to elect a new president , defying the taliban and others who are so intent on destabilizing the country .
a wonderful image that was pounced on by the government , which had even attempted to impose a blackout on media coverage of violence and intimidation .
however , it was a different story in many other areas , the city of kunduz in particular was targeted relentlessly by taliban rocket attacks and at least five people were hurt there on election day .
then there are the figures : 200,000 afghan and 100,000 international security forces were dispatched to protect the polling stations - hardly the sign of a normal election day , and if those numbers ultimately fail to provide adequate security , the situation becomes even more farcical .
the violence has also overshadowed another danger overshadowing these polls , namely fraud and vote rigging .
many polling stations were forced to stay shut , not only those in the taliban-dominated south .
others may have opened , however election observers were not granted access - thus it 's almost impossible to know what happened at those polling stations .

despite measures to abolish slavery worldwide , human trafficking and forced labour remain very evident across the globe .
poor people , who come to foreign countries in search of a better life , are the most vulnerable .
christina from myanmar is one of the many who have been subjected to human rights violations . in the fall of 2003 , christina came to the us with new dreams in her eyes .
in her country myanmar , she saw little hope .
as a member of the indian minority community and as a christian in a predominantly buddhist country , she often felt like an outsider .
her success at school was the only respite to compensate for the discrimination she was experiencing almost everyday .
then she got admission into an american university .
a future full of hopes for her .
“ i knew that i was going to do well in the school , ” she says .
“ i was 19 and i had plans to finish school in four years , go on peace corps , help out people , and come back , do my graduate school .
so i had my life planned out already ahead of time . ”
turn of events but her life changed soon .
from a confident student , she became a victim of economic exploitation .
she had to work at her aunt ’ s restaurant in the us .
“ for about a month , life was good .
and then it started changing gradually , " says christina .
“ i was pressured into doing a lot of things that i didn ’ t want to do .
first of all , i worked for her business , so i was i already spending time outside the house with her , for her and then i would come home and put up with the family , having to take care of all the chores and things around .
it was like 24/7 .
i was a slave . ”
christina did not resist .
her cultural background demanded an unconditional obedience to elders .
forced labour for the university , she had less and less time .
and because her aunt ’ s restaurant was not running well , she had no money for her tuition fees either .
as a result , christina had to stop her studies .
with this , she automatically lost her residence permit and was forced into staying illegally in the united states .
she was now completely dependent on her aunt : “ i would get up around 6 , sometimes 7 , if i was very tired .
i 'd spend an hour on the road just to get to the restaurant , just to make sure that everything was ok before we opened and then go back in the kitchen and then start cooking and cleaning without a break .
i mean i would stop to eat but that ’ s pretty much all i had . ”
verbal and physical abuse the other employees at the restaurant were given a proper wage .
but christina didn ’ t even get a cent .
instead , she was assaulted verbally and at times physically .
amid fear of deportation , she did not know whom she could turn to for help .
she might have continued to work for her aunt , until one night , when her drunken uncle became too intrusive .
in panic and fear christina grabbed her belongings and left the house .
help from an organisation she was fortunate .
her immediate neighbour helped her and brought her into contact with the relief organization , " break the chain campaign " , where she got legal advice and help .
qimmah najeeullah , the director of the organization , explains : “ i think we all underestimate the power of the psychological version .
often times the trafficker or the employers explain the world to be really different than what it really is .
they will say : you see all the violence in the news .
oh !
that could be you . and it is natural for you to want to be in an environment that is safe .
and if you know it is an abuse and it is a limitation , it is still more comfortable than what you don ’ t know . ”
as a victim of trafficking christina was actually entitled to a so-called t-visa which could have legalised her stay in the u.s. but she refused to take it , as this could have meant that she stood as a witness against her aunt .
she is now married to a us citizen and is a green card holder .
she is also looking forward to her return to university .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 21.08.2009 asia needs water reforms : expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water scarcity affects agriculture and can subsequently cause food crisis the annual international conference on water issues , the " world water week " has ended in stockholm .
india 's sanitation pioneer bindeshwar pathak is this year 's winner of the prestigious stockholm water prize for his simple toilet system which is used in india and other countries .
during the conference , experts highlighted asia 's need to improve irrigation to feed its growing population . asia must improve its irrigation and farming processes to ward off food scarcity and social disorder , a joint study by the international water management institute and the un food and agriculture organisation fao says .
colin charters , the director general of the international water management institute explains : “ the critical issue is that if we get more frequent food crises , these food crises mean that people 's livelihoods are affected on farms , people 's nourishment is affected .
these things can lead to social unrest within countries .
that social unrest can be capitalised on by disruptive elements .
and where we see this kind of hardship , we tend to see people wanting to migrate out of the region . ”
meeting food needs the best way to avoid this scenario is of course to make sure people are well fed and happy in their own country .
the report describes three options for meeting the food needs of asia .
the first is to import huge quantities of cereals from other regions - but the report foretells that this is politically too risky .
the second option would be to improve and expand rain-fed agriculture - largely impractical , as suitable land is already in use in many areas .
the only remaining solution therefore is to focus on irrigated farmlands .
the report says that for this , the irrigation systems in asia need to be revitalised .
water reforms charters calls for major water reforms to increase food supply in asia .
“ the steps needed are : one , recognition of the problem by the powers-that-be like the politicians ; two , reform of the institutions that manage water and the way water is governed particularly making sure that people ’ s rights to water are recognised in law and legislation , making sure that those rights protect the water for the farmers .
on farms and in irrigation systems technical reforms are needed which will increase productivity - meaning that farmers will benefit , not only by growing more , they 'll also get more profit . ”
charters urges that asian governments must help the farmers implement these reforms : “ one of the things they can do is to encourage capacity building in farmers , teaching them new techniques , helping them through investments and availability of micro-finance in higher-tech types of irrigation technology such as drippers and sometimes sprinklers .
all these things use less water and increase productivity . ”
besides , charters thinks harvesting rain water and making it available for irrigation will be a good idea for developing countries to adopt so as to save precious ground water .
experts warn that water shortages in asia will probably be further aggravated by climate change , which is likely to make rainfall more irregular .

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .
" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .

van gaal will be without the injured martin demichelis in defense and captain mark van bommel in midfield , but is hoping french international franck ribery will be available .
ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .
the arrival of gomez and olic seems to have relegated toni to the bench but chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has warned against writing off the 32-year-old .
" he is mentally strong and i am convinced that after returning from italy he will be training hard and working on his comeback .
i think we 'll still have a lot of fun with him in munich , " he said .

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .
" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .
the nigerian missed training on wednesday with a cold , but is expected to recover by sunday , probably to take a place on the bench .
bayern looking for first win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is frustrated by his team 's sluggish start bayern munich , meanwhile , will be looking for a first victory after two draws under dutch coach louis van gaal when they travel to promoted mainz on saturday .
van gaal will be without the injured martin demichelis in defense and captain mark van bommel in midfield , but is hoping french international franck ribery will be available .
ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .
the arrival of gomez and olic seems to have relegated toni to the bench but chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has warned against writing off the 32-year-old .
" he is mentally strong and i am convinced that after returning from italy he will be training hard and working on his comeback .
i think we 'll still have a lot of fun with him in munich , " he said .
basement battlers looking for first points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince poldi 's return to cologne has not been a happy one at the other end of the table the arrival of striker lukas podolski from bayern has not translated to points for cologne who are bottom following two defeats ahead of saturday 's visit by eintracht frankfurt .
cologne will feel it 's a must-win game as tough matches follow against hamburg , schalke , stuttgart , bayer leverkusen and bayern munich .
" we have to stay calm and not get hectic .
we have shown that we can match opponents like wolfsburg -lrb- a 3-1 home defeat -rrb- .
but the two first games have shown that it 's going to be a tough season , " podolski told kicker sports magazine .
hanover , who visit nuremberg on saturday , are also looking for a first win as well as a new coach after dieter hecking threw in the towel late wednesday .
werder bremen - boosted by the signing of last season 's on-loan striker claudio pizarro - are another side seeking a first win , with borussia moenchengladbach the visitors on sunday .
borussia dortmund and stuttgart - both fancied to do well this season - meet on saturday , while leverkusen are at promoted freiburg in the day 's other game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.08.2009 graphics will take a backseat to game design , story großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the games developers conference and gamescom gave players a chance to see upcoming titles the electronic entertainment industry 's heavyweights showed off their shiniest toys at the games developers conference in cologne .
soothsayers of the business also tried to predict the future of gaming technology . cologne is hosting the games developers conference , an industry-insider conference which ended on wednesday , and gamescom , a massive public celebration of electronic entertainment , through sunday .
one of germany 's biggest game developers , frankfurt-based crytek was there hawking its new cryengine3 software development toolset .
crytek is best known for its non-linear game-play and graphically intense action games such as " farcry " and " crysis . "
even as console gaming platforms like the xbox 360 and playstation3 have proven themselves software-selling juggernauts , the gaming industry will have to stop focusing purely on graphics to be successful , according to crytek founder cevat yerli .
building a better game video gaming graphics advances are effectively stalled for the next three years , yerli said , as maximum screen resolution is tied to the gaming console development cycle .
that means developers will have to find other ways to grab gamers ' interest .
until 2012 , crytek will rely on improving artificial intelligence , physics and special effects in order to differentiate itself from other games developers , he said .
" the online gaming market is growing fast , " said patrick lehrmann , a project manager for games academy , a school for game developers .
" and this market is not about graphics .
it 's going to be absolutely about game design . " "
instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 . " this will be a first person shooter , somewhat akin to the games that crytek has made such a name for itself in producing . but ccp is taking this model a step further . dust 514 will be a console multiplayer game , which will take place within the well-established universe of eve online . " we 're creating an fps with consequences and benefits for gamers ' actions , " richardsson said .
first person shooters tend to boast impressive graphics , and from the video ccp showed at the game 's announcement , dust will be no exception , but behind the surface of the game they plan to implement further layers of robust design .
the battles won or lost in dust will impact the eve universe and vice versa , and ccp hopes that cooperative alliances will emerge between players in the two linked games . good looks are hard to believe while games developers will always strive to look good , there are some who are re-thinking the often superficial approach to game development , such as crytek 's yerli .
" it 's better to create a believable world than a realistic world , " yerli said in an interview with deutsche welle , saying that it 's best to back away from attempting photo-realism and to create worlds that capture gamers ' attention .
most people ca n't tell the difference between the graphics in a game from seven years ago and a game from last year , lehrmann said , but they know when a game they play is well designed .
" they can recognize how beautiful the work is that went into it , " he said .

one of germany 's biggest game developers , frankfurt-based crytek was there hawking its new cryengine3 software development toolset .
crytek is best known for its non-linear game-play and graphically intense action games such as " farcry " and " crysis . "
even as console gaming platforms like the xbox 360 and playstation3 have proven themselves software-selling juggernauts , the gaming industry will have to stop focusing purely on graphics to be successful , according to crytek founder cevat yerli .
building a better game video gaming graphics advances are effectively stalled for the next three years , yerli said , as maximum screen resolution is tied to the gaming console development cycle .
that means developers will have to find other ways to grab gamers ' interest .
until 2012 , crytek will rely on improving artificial intelligence , physics and special effects in order to differentiate itself from other games developers , he said .
" the online gaming market is growing fast , " said patrick lehrmann , a project manager for games academy , a school for game developers .
" and this market is not about graphics .
it 's going to be absolutely about game design . " "
instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 .

three suspected eta logistics officers were arrested in the french alpine resort town of le corbier on wednesday , two weeks after a deadly bombing in majorca killed two police officers . large amounts of bomb-making equipment were found the same day . on thursday police found two further caches , the largest in the herault region of france , a few hours from the spanish border , stocked with sufficient explosives to make " dozens of bombs " , according to madrid .

that leaves germany as a lone voice against the " monopolization " and " americanization " of european culture . paris ' bibliotheque nationale de france -lrb- bnf -rrb- said thursday that it is in talks with google over the possibility of allowing the california-based internet giant to scan a portion of its 30 million books and documents , making them available free of charge on the internet . thirty libraries , including renowned university institutions at harvard , princeton and oxford , are already involved in the project , which aims to digitalize both out-of-print books as well as publications that are currently on the market . germany rejects google plan if the influential bnf reaches an agreement with google , it would mean a significant blow to the german government 's adamant stance against the book search project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has said it intends to scan only excerpts of books currently on the market " i have protested against google and will continue to do so , as long as copyrighted works are scanned without the prior approval of the author , " bernd neumann , germany 's minister of culture , said thursday . in the us , google has reached a legal agreement with publishing houses , according to which they receive a lump sum for the books offered up for scanning .
the authors themselves are not consulted . also on thursday , the german publishers and booksellers association issued a statement welcoming the digitalization of copyright-free material .

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .
" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .
the nigerian missed training on wednesday with a cold , but is expected to recover by sunday , probably to take a place on the bench .
bayern looking for first win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is frustrated by his team 's sluggish start bayern munich , meanwhile , will be looking for a first victory after two draws under dutch coach louis van gaal when they travel to promoted mainz on saturday .
van gaal will be without the injured martin demichelis in defense and captain mark van bommel in midfield , but is hoping french international franck ribery will be available .
ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .
the arrival of gomez and olic seems to have relegated toni to the bench but chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has warned against writing off the 32-year-old .
" he is mentally strong and i am convinced that after returning from italy he will be training hard and working on his comeback .
i think we 'll still have a lot of fun with him in munich , " he said .
basement battlers looking for first points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince poldi 's return to cologne has not been a happy one at the other end of the table the arrival of striker lukas podolski from bayern has not translated to points for cologne who are bottom following two defeats ahead of saturday 's visit by eintracht frankfurt .
cologne will feel it 's a must-win game as tough matches follow against hamburg , schalke , stuttgart , bayer leverkusen and bayern munich .
" we have to stay calm and not get hectic .
we have shown that we can match opponents like wolfsburg -lrb- a 3-1 home defeat -rrb- .
but the two first games have shown that it 's going to be a tough season , " podolski told kicker sports magazine .
hanover , who visit nuremberg on saturday , are also looking for a first win as well as a new coach after dieter hecking threw in the towel late wednesday .
werder bremen - boosted by the signing of last season 's on-loan striker claudio pizarro - are another side seeking a first win , with borussia moenchengladbach the visitors on sunday .
borussia dortmund and stuttgart - both fancied to do well this season - meet on saturday , while leverkusen are at promoted freiburg in the day 's other game .

that leaves germany as a lone voice against the " monopolization " and " americanization " of european culture . paris ' bibliotheque nationale de france -lrb- bnf -rrb- said thursday that it is in talks with google over the possibility of allowing the california-based internet giant to scan a portion of its 30 million books and documents , making them available free of charge on the internet . thirty libraries , including renowned university institutions at harvard , princeton and oxford , are already involved in the project , which aims to digitalize both out-of-print books as well as publications that are currently on the market . germany rejects google plan if the influential bnf reaches an agreement with google , it would mean a significant blow to the german government 's adamant stance against the book search project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has said it intends to scan only excerpts of books currently on the market " i have protested against google and will continue to do so , as long as copyrighted works are scanned without the prior approval of the author , " bernd neumann , germany 's minister of culture , said thursday . in the us , google has reached a legal agreement with publishing houses , according to which they receive a lump sum for the books offered up for scanning .
the authors themselves are not consulted . also on thursday , the german publishers and booksellers association issued a statement welcoming the digitalization of copyright-free material .
however , it criticized the european commission and the major participating eu states for supporting the google project . " states are being negligent with their cultural heritage when they turn it over to a monopolist and thereby run tax-funded projects like the european digital library europeana into the ground , " said alexander skipis , the association 's director . brussels gives its blessing launched in november 2008 , the europeana digital library offers users access to some two million digital objects including film material , photos , maps , books , newspapers and other documents . eu commissioner for information , society and media , vivane reding , told german daily handelsblatt that 90 percent of all archived books worldwide were no longer in print and therefore not accessible to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bavarian state library is the only one in germany to make a deal with google " it 's good that new business models are developed to bring this content to the consumers , " said reding , adding that digitalization was an expensive undertaking that could n't be borne by governments alone . french library reconsiders the bnf has a digitalization project of its own , with 100,000 books and rare documents being scanned each year over a course of three years .
these are available on the french web site gallica . in 2005 , bnf 's director at the time , jean-noel jeanneney , was adamantly opposed to the budding google project , which he viewed as the americanization of european culture . though the german government is unyielding in its opposition to the mass digitalization endeavor , one library in germany - the bavarian state library in munich - has signed a contract with google . france 's change of heart on the matter is another thorn in the side of germany 's ministry of culture . kjb / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's sabina matthay examines how free and fair the elections actually were . almost defiantly , the afghan foreign ministry declared that election day was a success .
indeed , there are some who say the events could pass as a trial run for democracy , as a step toward real democratic change , peace and prosperity .
on the surface it may have been a day to remember : in many provinces and towns voters lined up to elect a new president , defying the taliban and others who are so intent on destabilizing the country .
a wonderful image that was pounced on by the government , which had even attempted to impose a blackout on media coverage of violence and intimidation .
however , it was a different story in many other areas , the city of kunduz in particular was targeted relentlessly by taliban rocket attacks and at least five people were hurt there on election day .
then there are the figures : 200,000 afghan and 100,000 international security forces were dispatched to protect the polling stations - hardly the sign of a normal election day , and if those numbers ultimately fail to provide adequate security , the situation becomes even more farcical .
the violence has also overshadowed another danger overshadowing these polls , namely fraud and vote rigging .
many polling stations were forced to stay shut , not only those in the taliban-dominated south .
others may have opened , however election observers were not granted access - thus it 's almost impossible to know what happened at those polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been wide-spread allegations of vote rigging there was evidence of fraud at the last presidential election in 2004 , this time observers say the vote rigging was systematic .
it has been widely reported that incumbent - and unpopular - leader hamid karzai has absolutely no interest in being forced into a run-off poll , which could see him defeated .
as always these allegations are based on rumors and counter-rumors , however the very fact that the electoral commission , tasked with guaranteeing a free and fair poll , sent out thousands of election documents to children ineligible to vote highlights the lack of transparency and fairness , and further undermines any confidence in the government .
should these allegations be confirmed , it could spell the beginning of the end for a democratically-rooted afghanistan .

dw 's sabina matthay examines how free and fair the elections actually were . almost defiantly , the afghan foreign ministry declared that election day was a success .
indeed , there are some who say the events could pass as a trial run for democracy , as a step toward real democratic change , peace and prosperity .
on the surface it may have been a day to remember : in many provinces and towns voters lined up to elect a new president , defying the taliban and others who are so intent on destabilizing the country .
a wonderful image that was pounced on by the government , which had even attempted to impose a blackout on media coverage of violence and intimidation .
however , it was a different story in many other areas , the city of kunduz in particular was targeted relentlessly by taliban rocket attacks and at least five people were hurt there on election day .
then there are the figures : 200,000 afghan and 100,000 international security forces were dispatched to protect the polling stations - hardly the sign of a normal election day , and if those numbers ultimately fail to provide adequate security , the situation becomes even more farcical .
the violence has also overshadowed another danger overshadowing these polls , namely fraud and vote rigging .
many polling stations were forced to stay shut , not only those in the taliban-dominated south .
others may have opened , however election observers were not granted access - thus it 's almost impossible to know what happened at those polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been wide-spread allegations of vote rigging there was evidence of fraud at the last presidential election in 2004 , this time observers say the vote rigging was systematic .
it has been widely reported that incumbent - and unpopular - leader hamid karzai has absolutely no interest in being forced into a run-off poll , which could see him defeated .
as always these allegations are based on rumors and counter-rumors , however the very fact that the electoral commission , tasked with guaranteeing a free and fair poll , sent out thousands of election documents to children ineligible to vote highlights the lack of transparency and fairness , and further undermines any confidence in the government .
should these allegations be confirmed , it could spell the beginning of the end for a democratically-rooted afghanistan .

officials plan to announce results next week . the afghan election authority has finished counting the majority of ballots cast and plans to announce results on tuesday .
" the counting is finished for the presidential race , " independent election commission official zekria barakzai told afp news agency .
counting for the provincial vote is continuing in kabul , nangarhar and herat , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent hamid karzai 's team says most afghans voted for him barakzai described voter turnout as " satisfactory , " estimating that between 40 to 50 percent of the roughly 17 million afghans eligible to vote went to the polls .
despite the lack of official results , the two main candidates ' campaigns both claimed victories on friday .
karzai and abdullah both confident " initial results show that the president has got a majority , " incumbent president hamid karzai 's campaign manager told reuters news agency .
" we will not go to a second round .
we have got a majority , " said deen mohammad , adding that it was up to the election commission to release official results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah abdullah 's campaign says victory is his mohammad said his data was based on information from almost 29,000 monitors that the karzai campaign had stationed at polling booths around the country .
however , karzai 's chief rival - former foreign minister abdullah abdullah - contested this claim .
" it is n't true , " said spokesman fazl sangcharaki .
" we also say , maybe we do n't need a second round , because abdullah has won . "
elections in afghanistan were relatively peaceful , despite taliban threats to disrupt the vote .
there were reports of sporadic violence throughout the country , with over 20 deaths on thursday .
still , the attacks were less serious than many experts had feared .
the taliban had also discouraged people from going to the polls in a bid to lower turnout and tarnish the vote 's legitimacy .
based on election commission estimates , turnout was lower than in the previous poll , in 2005. msh / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's sabina matthay examines how free and fair the elections actually were . almost defiantly , the afghan foreign ministry declared that election day was a success .
indeed , there are some who say the events could pass as a trial run for democracy , as a step toward real democratic change , peace and prosperity .

a wonderful image that was pounced on by the government , which had even attempted to impose a blackout on media coverage of violence and intimidation .
however , it was a different story in many other areas , the city of kunduz in particular was targeted relentlessly by taliban rocket attacks and at least five people were hurt there on election day .
then there are the figures : 200,000 afghan and 100,000 international security forces were dispatched to protect the polling stations - hardly the sign of a normal election day , and if those numbers ultimately fail to provide adequate security , the situation becomes even more farcical .
the violence has also overshadowed another danger overshadowing these polls , namely fraud and vote rigging .
many polling stations were forced to stay shut , not only those in the taliban-dominated south .
others may have opened , however election observers were not granted access - thus it 's almost impossible to know what happened at those polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been wide-spread allegations of vote rigging there was evidence of fraud at the last presidential election in 2004 , this time observers say the vote rigging was systematic .
it has been widely reported that incumbent - and unpopular - leader hamid karzai has absolutely no interest in being forced into a run-off poll , which could see him defeated .
as always these allegations are based on rumors and counter-rumors , however the very fact that the electoral commission , tasked with guaranteeing a free and fair poll , sent out thousands of election documents to children ineligible to vote highlights the lack of transparency and fairness , and further undermines any confidence in the government .
should these allegations be confirmed , it could spell the beginning of the end for a democratically-rooted afghanistan .

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .
" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .

ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .
the arrival of gomez and olic seems to have relegated toni to the bench but chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has warned against writing off the 32-year-old .

" extensive online access to the database -lrb- … -rrb- represents an important barrier to the illicit trafficking of a stolen cultural object by making its sale more difficult , " kind said . victorine stille works for the art loss register , an international company that also keeps an online database of stolen art .
their company also keeps a database of stolen goods , and takes a fee for checking on the provenance of artworks - for buyers who want to be sure about their art investments , for example . she agrees on the importance of transparency when it comes to stolen art , and welcomes the presence of another international art register . " the art loss register has always worked very closely with interpol and other police agencies , " stille said . " both of our aims is to solve art crimes ... interpol is helping to create public awareness of the problem .
its good that they 've made the database available to everyone because now people ca n't hide anymore by saying ' oh , we did n't know .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 21.08.2009 modern day slavery : a story of a student from myanmar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human trafficking and slavery are rampant in asia and elsewhere on sunday , unesco will mark the international day for the remembrance of the slave trade and its abolition .
despite measures to abolish slavery worldwide , human trafficking and forced labour remain very evident across the globe .
poor people , who come to foreign countries in search of a better life , are the most vulnerable .
christina from myanmar is one of the many who have been subjected to human rights violations . in the fall of 2003 , christina came to the us with new dreams in her eyes .
in her country myanmar , she saw little hope .
as a member of the indian minority community and as a christian in a predominantly buddhist country , she often felt like an outsider .
her success at school was the only respite to compensate for the discrimination she was experiencing almost everyday .
then she got admission into an american university .
a future full of hopes for her .
“ i knew that i was going to do well in the school , ” she says .
“ i was 19 and i had plans to finish school in four years , go on peace corps , help out people , and come back , do my graduate school .
so i had my life planned out already ahead of time . ”
turn of events but her life changed soon .
from a confident student , she became a victim of economic exploitation .
she had to work at her aunt ’ s restaurant in the us .
“ for about a month , life was good .
and then it started changing gradually , " says christina .
“ i was pressured into doing a lot of things that i didn ’ t want to do .
first of all , i worked for her business , so i was i already spending time outside the house with her , for her and then i would come home and put up with the family , having to take care of all the chores and things around .
it was like 24/7 .
i was a slave . ”
christina did not resist .
her cultural background demanded an unconditional obedience to elders .
forced labour for the university , she had less and less time .
and because her aunt ’ s restaurant was not running well , she had no money for her tuition fees either .
as a result , christina had to stop her studies .
with this , she automatically lost her residence permit and was forced into staying illegally in the united states .
she was now completely dependent on her aunt : “ i would get up around 6 , sometimes 7 , if i was very tired .
i 'd spend an hour on the road just to get to the restaurant , just to make sure that everything was ok before we opened and then go back in the kitchen and then start cooking and cleaning without a break .
i mean i would stop to eat but that ’ s pretty much all i had . ”
verbal and physical abuse the other employees at the restaurant were given a proper wage .
but christina didn ’ t even get a cent .
instead , she was assaulted verbally and at times physically .
amid fear of deportation , she did not know whom she could turn to for help .
she might have continued to work for her aunt , until one night , when her drunken uncle became too intrusive .
in panic and fear christina grabbed her belongings and left the house .
help from an organisation she was fortunate .
her immediate neighbour helped her and brought her into contact with the relief organization , " break the chain campaign " , where she got legal advice and help .
qimmah najeeullah , the director of the organization , explains : “ i think we all underestimate the power of the psychological version .
often times the trafficker or the employers explain the world to be really different than what it really is .
they will say : you see all the violence in the news .
oh !
that could be you . and it is natural for you to want to be in an environment that is safe .
and if you know it is an abuse and it is a limitation , it is still more comfortable than what you don ’ t know . ”
as a victim of trafficking christina was actually entitled to a so-called t-visa which could have legalised her stay in the u.s. but she refused to take it , as this could have meant that she stood as a witness against her aunt .
she is now married to a us citizen and is a green card holder .

despite measures to abolish slavery worldwide , human trafficking and forced labour remain very evident across the globe .
poor people , who come to foreign countries in search of a better life , are the most vulnerable .
christina from myanmar is one of the many who have been subjected to human rights violations . in the fall of 2003 , christina came to the us with new dreams in her eyes .
in her country myanmar , she saw little hope .
as a member of the indian minority community and as a christian in a predominantly buddhist country , she often felt like an outsider .
her success at school was the only respite to compensate for the discrimination she was experiencing almost everyday .
then she got admission into an american university .
a future full of hopes for her .
“ i knew that i was going to do well in the school , ” she says .
“ i was 19 and i had plans to finish school in four years , go on peace corps , help out people , and come back , do my graduate school .
so i had my life planned out already ahead of time . ”
turn of events but her life changed soon .
from a confident student , she became a victim of economic exploitation .
she had to work at her aunt ’ s restaurant in the us .
“ for about a month , life was good .
and then it started changing gradually , " says christina .
“ i was pressured into doing a lot of things that i didn ’ t want to do .
first of all , i worked for her business , so i was i already spending time outside the house with her , for her and then i would come home and put up with the family , having to take care of all the chores and things around .
it was like 24/7 .
i was a slave . ”
christina did not resist .
her cultural background demanded an unconditional obedience to elders .
forced labour for the university , she had less and less time .
and because her aunt ’ s restaurant was not running well , she had no money for her tuition fees either .
as a result , christina had to stop her studies .
with this , she automatically lost her residence permit and was forced into staying illegally in the united states .
she was now completely dependent on her aunt : “ i would get up around 6 , sometimes 7 , if i was very tired .
i 'd spend an hour on the road just to get to the restaurant , just to make sure that everything was ok before we opened and then go back in the kitchen and then start cooking and cleaning without a break .
i mean i would stop to eat but that ’ s pretty much all i had . ”
verbal and physical abuse the other employees at the restaurant were given a proper wage .
but christina didn ’ t even get a cent .
instead , she was assaulted verbally and at times physically .
amid fear of deportation , she did not know whom she could turn to for help .
she might have continued to work for her aunt , until one night , when her drunken uncle became too intrusive .
in panic and fear christina grabbed her belongings and left the house .
help from an organisation she was fortunate .
her immediate neighbour helped her and brought her into contact with the relief organization , " break the chain campaign " , where she got legal advice and help .
qimmah najeeullah , the director of the organization , explains : “ i think we all underestimate the power of the psychological version .
often times the trafficker or the employers explain the world to be really different than what it really is .
they will say : you see all the violence in the news .
oh !
that could be you . and it is natural for you to want to be in an environment that is safe .
and if you know it is an abuse and it is a limitation , it is still more comfortable than what you don ’ t know . ”
as a victim of trafficking christina was actually entitled to a so-called t-visa which could have legalised her stay in the u.s. but she refused to take it , as this could have meant that she stood as a witness against her aunt .
she is now married to a us citizen and is a green card holder .
she is also looking forward to her return to university .

india 's sanitation pioneer bindeshwar pathak is this year 's winner of the prestigious stockholm water prize for his simple toilet system which is used in india and other countries .
during the conference , experts highlighted asia 's need to improve irrigation to feed its growing population . asia must improve its irrigation and farming processes to ward off food scarcity and social disorder , a joint study by the international water management institute and the un food and agriculture organisation fao says .
colin charters , the director general of the international water management institute explains : “ the critical issue is that if we get more frequent food crises , these food crises mean that people 's livelihoods are affected on farms , people 's nourishment is affected .
these things can lead to social unrest within countries .
that social unrest can be capitalised on by disruptive elements .
and where we see this kind of hardship , we tend to see people wanting to migrate out of the region . ”
meeting food needs the best way to avoid this scenario is of course to make sure people are well fed and happy in their own country .
the report describes three options for meeting the food needs of asia .
the first is to import huge quantities of cereals from other regions - but the report foretells that this is politically too risky .
the second option would be to improve and expand rain-fed agriculture - largely impractical , as suitable land is already in use in many areas .
the only remaining solution therefore is to focus on irrigated farmlands .
the report says that for this , the irrigation systems in asia need to be revitalised .
water reforms charters calls for major water reforms to increase food supply in asia .
“ the steps needed are : one , recognition of the problem by the powers-that-be like the politicians ; two , reform of the institutions that manage water and the way water is governed particularly making sure that people ’ s rights to water are recognised in law and legislation , making sure that those rights protect the water for the farmers .
on farms and in irrigation systems technical reforms are needed which will increase productivity - meaning that farmers will benefit , not only by growing more , they 'll also get more profit . ”
charters urges that asian governments must help the farmers implement these reforms : “ one of the things they can do is to encourage capacity building in farmers , teaching them new techniques , helping them through investments and availability of micro-finance in higher-tech types of irrigation technology such as drippers and sometimes sprinklers .
all these things use less water and increase productivity . ”
besides , charters thinks harvesting rain water and making it available for irrigation will be a good idea for developing countries to adopt so as to save precious ground water .
experts warn that water shortages in asia will probably be further aggravated by climate change , which is likely to make rainfall more irregular .

the ruling allows frankfurt airport to add a new runway and terminal as well as cargo and maintenance facilities .
the decision is a setback for environmentalists opposed to the destruction of forest land . europe 's third busiest airport is set to become much bigger , after a regional court 's decision on friday to allow frankfurt international airport to proceed with a 4 billion euro -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- expansion plan .
the regional administrative court for the state of hesse in the western city of kassel said it had received more than 200 complaints against the airport 's plans , but ruled that the potential economic benefit outweighed residents ' concerns about noise and destruction of a nearby forest .
several of the opposing parties said they planned to appeal to a federal court .
the airport will now begin construction of a fourth runway , a third terminal , and a cargo and maintenance base .
a press release on the fraport website indicated that the new runway would be scheduled to open in 2011 .
the court upheld existing restrictions on night flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m.
traffic at frankfurt 's airport is expected to rise to 88.6 million passengers by 2020 , up from 53.5 million in 2008. svs / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .
" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .
the nigerian missed training on wednesday with a cold , but is expected to recover by sunday , probably to take a place on the bench .
bayern looking for first win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is frustrated by his team 's sluggish start bayern munich , meanwhile , will be looking for a first victory after two draws under dutch coach louis van gaal when they travel to promoted mainz on saturday .
van gaal will be without the injured martin demichelis in defense and captain mark van bommel in midfield , but is hoping french international franck ribery will be available .
ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .
the arrival of gomez and olic seems to have relegated toni to the bench but chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has warned against writing off the 32-year-old .
" he is mentally strong and i am convinced that after returning from italy he will be training hard and working on his comeback .
i think we 'll still have a lot of fun with him in munich , " he said .

cologne will feel it 's a must-win game as tough matches follow against hamburg , schalke , stuttgart , bayer leverkusen and bayern munich .
" we have to stay calm and not get hectic .
we have shown that we can match opponents like wolfsburg -lrb- a 3-1 home defeat -rrb- .

" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .

van gaal will be without the injured martin demichelis in defense and captain mark van bommel in midfield , but is hoping french international franck ribery will be available .
ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .
the arrival of gomez and olic seems to have relegated toni to the bench but chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has warned against writing off the 32-year-old .

dw 's sabina matthay examines how free and fair the elections actually were . almost defiantly , the afghan foreign ministry declared that election day was a success .
indeed , there are some who say the events could pass as a trial run for democracy , as a step toward real democratic change , peace and prosperity .
on the surface it may have been a day to remember : in many provinces and towns voters lined up to elect a new president , defying the taliban and others who are so intent on destabilizing the country .
a wonderful image that was pounced on by the government , which had even attempted to impose a blackout on media coverage of violence and intimidation .
however , it was a different story in many other areas , the city of kunduz in particular was targeted relentlessly by taliban rocket attacks and at least five people were hurt there on election day .
then there are the figures : 200,000 afghan and 100,000 international security forces were dispatched to protect the polling stations - hardly the sign of a normal election day , and if those numbers ultimately fail to provide adequate security , the situation becomes even more farcical .
the violence has also overshadowed another danger overshadowing these polls , namely fraud and vote rigging .
many polling stations were forced to stay shut , not only those in the taliban-dominated south .
others may have opened , however election observers were not granted access - thus it 's almost impossible to know what happened at those polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been wide-spread allegations of vote rigging there was evidence of fraud at the last presidential election in 2004 , this time observers say the vote rigging was systematic .
it has been widely reported that incumbent - and unpopular - leader hamid karzai has absolutely no interest in being forced into a run-off poll , which could see him defeated .
as always these allegations are based on rumors and counter-rumors , however the very fact that the electoral commission , tasked with guaranteeing a free and fair poll , sent out thousands of election documents to children ineligible to vote highlights the lack of transparency and fairness , and further undermines any confidence in the government .
should these allegations be confirmed , it could spell the beginning of the end for a democratically-rooted afghanistan .

the system works by reflecting the light from 2,153 mirrors to a 22-square-meter -lrb- 239-square-foot -rrb- ceramic receptor atop a 60-meter tower .
the steam produced as gas in the receptor heats up to over 700 degrees celsius -lrb- 1,292 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and powers a turbine that is used to generate power .
the 23 million euro -lrb- $ 32.7 million -rrb- project that takes up about eight hectares -lrb- 20 acres -rrb- would be capable of powering 350 homes , according to juelich 's utility provider , which along with the juelich solar institute , german aerospace center and a munich power company is responsible for the power plant . role in desertec project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a project to deliver renewable energy from africa to europe could use similar technology " the area of renewable energy is of particular interest to export-heavy companies , " said christa thoben , north rhine-westphalia 's minister for economics and energy .
" the solar thermal power station in juelich is showing how it 's done . " despite receiving some 10.6 million euros of funding from the federal and two state governments , the array 's potential will likely not be realized in germany , but in sunnier regions closer to the equator , thoben said . german environment minister sigmar gabriel added that the new solar project would help solidify germany 's expertise in the renewable energy market . " we are creating the technical requirements for solar power to be delivered from the desert , " he said .
" thanks to these kinds of technical investments we are prepared to be a leader in a driving market of the future . " the technology is expected to play an important role in the desertec consortium 's plan to provide energy to europe from massive solar arrays in africa and the middle east . sms / dpa / editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.08.2009 graphics will take a backseat to game design , story großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the games developers conference and gamescom gave players a chance to see upcoming titles the electronic entertainment industry 's heavyweights showed off their shiniest toys at the games developers conference in cologne .
soothsayers of the business also tried to predict the future of gaming technology . cologne is hosting the games developers conference , an industry-insider conference which ended on wednesday , and gamescom , a massive public celebration of electronic entertainment , through sunday .
one of germany 's biggest game developers , frankfurt-based crytek was there hawking its new cryengine3 software development toolset .
crytek is best known for its non-linear game-play and graphically intense action games such as " farcry " and " crysis . "
even as console gaming platforms like the xbox 360 and playstation3 have proven themselves software-selling juggernauts , the gaming industry will have to stop focusing purely on graphics to be successful , according to crytek founder cevat yerli .
building a better game video gaming graphics advances are effectively stalled for the next three years , yerli said , as maximum screen resolution is tied to the gaming console development cycle .
that means developers will have to find other ways to grab gamers ' interest .
until 2012 , crytek will rely on improving artificial intelligence , physics and special effects in order to differentiate itself from other games developers , he said .
" the online gaming market is growing fast , " said patrick lehrmann , a project manager for games academy , a school for game developers .
" and this market is not about graphics .
it 's going to be absolutely about game design . " "
instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 . " this will be a first person shooter , somewhat akin to the games that crytek has made such a name for itself in producing . but ccp is taking this model a step further . dust 514 will be a console multiplayer game , which will take place within the well-established universe of eve online . " we 're creating an fps with consequences and benefits for gamers ' actions , " richardsson said .
first person shooters tend to boast impressive graphics , and from the video ccp showed at the game 's announcement , dust will be no exception , but behind the surface of the game they plan to implement further layers of robust design .
the battles won or lost in dust will impact the eve universe and vice versa , and ccp hopes that cooperative alliances will emerge between players in the two linked games . good looks are hard to believe while games developers will always strive to look good , there are some who are re-thinking the often superficial approach to game development , such as crytek 's yerli .
" it 's better to create a believable world than a realistic world , " yerli said in an interview with deutsche welle , saying that it 's best to back away from attempting photo-realism and to create worlds that capture gamers ' attention .
most people ca n't tell the difference between the graphics in a game from seven years ago and a game from last year , lehrmann said , but they know when a game they play is well designed .
" they can recognize how beautiful the work is that went into it , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.08.2009 graphics will take a backseat to game design , story großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the games developers conference and gamescom gave players a chance to see upcoming titles the electronic entertainment industry 's heavyweights showed off their shiniest toys at the games developers conference in cologne .
soothsayers of the business also tried to predict the future of gaming technology . cologne is hosting the games developers conference , an industry-insider conference which ended on wednesday , and gamescom , a massive public celebration of electronic entertainment , through sunday .
one of germany 's biggest game developers , frankfurt-based crytek was there hawking its new cryengine3 software development toolset .
crytek is best known for its non-linear game-play and graphically intense action games such as " farcry " and " crysis . "
even as console gaming platforms like the xbox 360 and playstation3 have proven themselves software-selling juggernauts , the gaming industry will have to stop focusing purely on graphics to be successful , according to crytek founder cevat yerli .
building a better game video gaming graphics advances are effectively stalled for the next three years , yerli said , as maximum screen resolution is tied to the gaming console development cycle .
that means developers will have to find other ways to grab gamers ' interest .
until 2012 , crytek will rely on improving artificial intelligence , physics and special effects in order to differentiate itself from other games developers , he said .
" the online gaming market is growing fast , " said patrick lehrmann , a project manager for games academy , a school for game developers .
" and this market is not about graphics .
it 's going to be absolutely about game design . " "
instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 . " this will be a first person shooter , somewhat akin to the games that crytek has made such a name for itself in producing . but ccp is taking this model a step further . dust 514 will be a console multiplayer game , which will take place within the well-established universe of eve online . " we 're creating an fps with consequences and benefits for gamers ' actions , " richardsson said .
first person shooters tend to boast impressive graphics , and from the video ccp showed at the game 's announcement , dust will be no exception , but behind the surface of the game they plan to implement further layers of robust design .
the battles won or lost in dust will impact the eve universe and vice versa , and ccp hopes that cooperative alliances will emerge between players in the two linked games . good looks are hard to believe while games developers will always strive to look good , there are some who are re-thinking the often superficial approach to game development , such as crytek 's yerli .
" it 's better to create a believable world than a realistic world , " yerli said in an interview with deutsche welle , saying that it 's best to back away from attempting photo-realism and to create worlds that capture gamers ' attention .
most people ca n't tell the difference between the graphics in a game from seven years ago and a game from last year , lehrmann said , but they know when a game they play is well designed .
" they can recognize how beautiful the work is that went into it , " he said .

a wonderful image that was pounced on by the government , which had even attempted to impose a blackout on media coverage of violence and intimidation .
however , it was a different story in many other areas , the city of kunduz in particular was targeted relentlessly by taliban rocket attacks and at least five people were hurt there on election day .
then there are the figures : 200,000 afghan and 100,000 international security forces were dispatched to protect the polling stations - hardly the sign of a normal election day , and if those numbers ultimately fail to provide adequate security , the situation becomes even more farcical .
the violence has also overshadowed another danger overshadowing these polls , namely fraud and vote rigging .
many polling stations were forced to stay shut , not only those in the taliban-dominated south .
others may have opened , however election observers were not granted access - thus it 's almost impossible to know what happened at those polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been wide-spread allegations of vote rigging there was evidence of fraud at the last presidential election in 2004 , this time observers say the vote rigging was systematic .
it has been widely reported that incumbent - and unpopular - leader hamid karzai has absolutely no interest in being forced into a run-off poll , which could see him defeated .
as always these allegations are based on rumors and counter-rumors , however the very fact that the electoral commission , tasked with guaranteeing a free and fair poll , sent out thousands of election documents to children ineligible to vote highlights the lack of transparency and fairness , and further undermines any confidence in the government .
should these allegations be confirmed , it could spell the beginning of the end for a democratically-rooted afghanistan .

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .
" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .

van gaal will be without the injured martin demichelis in defense and captain mark van bommel in midfield , but is hoping french international franck ribery will be available .
ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .
the arrival of gomez and olic seems to have relegated toni to the bench but chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has warned against writing off the 32-year-old .
" he is mentally strong and i am convinced that after returning from italy he will be training hard and working on his comeback .

no other country has ever swept the world championship or olympic race walking events .
50 kilometer-winner kirdyapkin says his victory was revenge for his wife 's defeat in the 20 kilometer race . russia became the first country ever to win all three race walking events in world championship or olympic competition on friday .
2005 world champion sergey kirdyapkin 's come-from-behind win completed the sweep when he finished the men 's 50 kilometer walking event in 3 hours , 38 minutes and 35 seconds . valeriy borchin and olga kaniskina won the men 's and women 's 20 kilometer events , respectively .
kirdyapkin , 29 , credited his win in part to support he got from off the track : a message from his wife , anisya kirdyapkina , who narrowly missed out on the bronze medal during the women 's walking event on august 16 .
" i got an sms from my wife this morning and she asked me to take revenge .
and that 's what happened , " kirdyapkin said .
kirdyapkin did n't know he was making sports history . " wow !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.08.2009 graphics will take a backseat to game design , story großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the games developers conference and gamescom gave players a chance to see upcoming titles the electronic entertainment industry 's heavyweights showed off their shiniest toys at the games developers conference in cologne .
soothsayers of the business also tried to predict the future of gaming technology . cologne is hosting the games developers conference , an industry-insider conference which ended on wednesday , and gamescom , a massive public celebration of electronic entertainment , through sunday .
one of germany 's biggest game developers , frankfurt-based crytek was there hawking its new cryengine3 software development toolset .
crytek is best known for its non-linear game-play and graphically intense action games such as " farcry " and " crysis . "
even as console gaming platforms like the xbox 360 and playstation3 have proven themselves software-selling juggernauts , the gaming industry will have to stop focusing purely on graphics to be successful , according to crytek founder cevat yerli .
building a better game video gaming graphics advances are effectively stalled for the next three years , yerli said , as maximum screen resolution is tied to the gaming console development cycle .
that means developers will have to find other ways to grab gamers ' interest .
until 2012 , crytek will rely on improving artificial intelligence , physics and special effects in order to differentiate itself from other games developers , he said .
" the online gaming market is growing fast , " said patrick lehrmann , a project manager for games academy , a school for game developers .
" and this market is not about graphics .
it 's going to be absolutely about game design . " "
instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 . " this will be a first person shooter , somewhat akin to the games that crytek has made such a name for itself in producing . but ccp is taking this model a step further . dust 514 will be a console multiplayer game , which will take place within the well-established universe of eve online . " we 're creating an fps with consequences and benefits for gamers ' actions , " richardsson said .
first person shooters tend to boast impressive graphics , and from the video ccp showed at the game 's announcement , dust will be no exception , but behind the surface of the game they plan to implement further layers of robust design .
the battles won or lost in dust will impact the eve universe and vice versa , and ccp hopes that cooperative alliances will emerge between players in the two linked games . good looks are hard to believe while games developers will always strive to look good , there are some who are re-thinking the often superficial approach to game development , such as crytek 's yerli .
" it 's better to create a believable world than a realistic world , " yerli said in an interview with deutsche welle , saying that it 's best to back away from attempting photo-realism and to create worlds that capture gamers ' attention .
most people ca n't tell the difference between the graphics in a game from seven years ago and a game from last year , lehrmann said , but they know when a game they play is well designed .
" they can recognize how beautiful the work is that went into it , " he said .

the battles won or lost in dust will impact the eve universe and vice versa , and ccp hopes that cooperative alliances will emerge between players in the two linked games . good looks are hard to believe while games developers will always strive to look good , there are some who are re-thinking the often superficial approach to game development , such as crytek 's yerli .

soothsayers of the business also tried to predict the future of gaming technology . cologne is hosting the games developers conference , an industry-insider conference which ended on wednesday , and gamescom , a massive public celebration of electronic entertainment , through sunday .
one of germany 's biggest game developers , frankfurt-based crytek was there hawking its new cryengine3 software development toolset .
crytek is best known for its non-linear game-play and graphically intense action games such as " farcry " and " crysis . "
even as console gaming platforms like the xbox 360 and playstation3 have proven themselves software-selling juggernauts , the gaming industry will have to stop focusing purely on graphics to be successful , according to crytek founder cevat yerli .
building a better game video gaming graphics advances are effectively stalled for the next three years , yerli said , as maximum screen resolution is tied to the gaming console development cycle .
that means developers will have to find other ways to grab gamers ' interest .
until 2012 , crytek will rely on improving artificial intelligence , physics and special effects in order to differentiate itself from other games developers , he said .
" the online gaming market is growing fast , " said patrick lehrmann , a project manager for games academy , a school for game developers .
" and this market is not about graphics .
it 's going to be absolutely about game design . " "
instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 . " this will be a first person shooter , somewhat akin to the games that crytek has made such a name for itself in producing . but ccp is taking this model a step further . dust 514 will be a console multiplayer game , which will take place within the well-established universe of eve online .

india 's sanitation pioneer bindeshwar pathak is this year 's winner of the prestigious stockholm water prize for his simple toilet system which is used in india and other countries .
during the conference , experts highlighted asia 's need to improve irrigation to feed its growing population . asia must improve its irrigation and farming processes to ward off food scarcity and social disorder , a joint study by the international water management institute and the un food and agriculture organisation fao says .
colin charters , the director general of the international water management institute explains : “ the critical issue is that if we get more frequent food crises , these food crises mean that people 's livelihoods are affected on farms , people 's nourishment is affected .
these things can lead to social unrest within countries .
that social unrest can be capitalised on by disruptive elements .
and where we see this kind of hardship , we tend to see people wanting to migrate out of the region . ”
meeting food needs the best way to avoid this scenario is of course to make sure people are well fed and happy in their own country .
the report describes three options for meeting the food needs of asia .
the first is to import huge quantities of cereals from other regions - but the report foretells that this is politically too risky .
the second option would be to improve and expand rain-fed agriculture - largely impractical , as suitable land is already in use in many areas .
the only remaining solution therefore is to focus on irrigated farmlands .
the report says that for this , the irrigation systems in asia need to be revitalised .
water reforms charters calls for major water reforms to increase food supply in asia .
“ the steps needed are : one , recognition of the problem by the powers-that-be like the politicians ; two , reform of the institutions that manage water and the way water is governed particularly making sure that people ’ s rights to water are recognised in law and legislation , making sure that those rights protect the water for the farmers .
on farms and in irrigation systems technical reforms are needed which will increase productivity - meaning that farmers will benefit , not only by growing more , they 'll also get more profit . ”
charters urges that asian governments must help the farmers implement these reforms : “ one of the things they can do is to encourage capacity building in farmers , teaching them new techniques , helping them through investments and availability of micro-finance in higher-tech types of irrigation technology such as drippers and sometimes sprinklers .
all these things use less water and increase productivity . ”
besides , charters thinks harvesting rain water and making it available for irrigation will be a good idea for developing countries to adopt so as to save precious ground water .
experts warn that water shortages in asia will probably be further aggravated by climate change , which is likely to make rainfall more irregular .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.08.2009 graphics will take a backseat to game design , story großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the games developers conference and gamescom gave players a chance to see upcoming titles the electronic entertainment industry 's heavyweights showed off their shiniest toys at the games developers conference in cologne .
soothsayers of the business also tried to predict the future of gaming technology . cologne is hosting the games developers conference , an industry-insider conference which ended on wednesday , and gamescom , a massive public celebration of electronic entertainment , through sunday .
one of germany 's biggest game developers , frankfurt-based crytek was there hawking its new cryengine3 software development toolset .
crytek is best known for its non-linear game-play and graphically intense action games such as " farcry " and " crysis . "
even as console gaming platforms like the xbox 360 and playstation3 have proven themselves software-selling juggernauts , the gaming industry will have to stop focusing purely on graphics to be successful , according to crytek founder cevat yerli .
building a better game video gaming graphics advances are effectively stalled for the next three years , yerli said , as maximum screen resolution is tied to the gaming console development cycle .
that means developers will have to find other ways to grab gamers ' interest .
until 2012 , crytek will rely on improving artificial intelligence , physics and special effects in order to differentiate itself from other games developers , he said .
" the online gaming market is growing fast , " said patrick lehrmann , a project manager for games academy , a school for game developers .
" and this market is not about graphics .
it 's going to be absolutely about game design . " "
instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 . " this will be a first person shooter , somewhat akin to the games that crytek has made such a name for itself in producing . but ccp is taking this model a step further . dust 514 will be a console multiplayer game , which will take place within the well-established universe of eve online . " we 're creating an fps with consequences and benefits for gamers ' actions , " richardsson said .
first person shooters tend to boast impressive graphics , and from the video ccp showed at the game 's announcement , dust will be no exception , but behind the surface of the game they plan to implement further layers of robust design .
the battles won or lost in dust will impact the eve universe and vice versa , and ccp hopes that cooperative alliances will emerge between players in the two linked games . good looks are hard to believe while games developers will always strive to look good , there are some who are re-thinking the often superficial approach to game development , such as crytek 's yerli .
" it 's better to create a believable world than a realistic world , " yerli said in an interview with deutsche welle , saying that it 's best to back away from attempting photo-realism and to create worlds that capture gamers ' attention .
most people ca n't tell the difference between the graphics in a game from seven years ago and a game from last year , lehrmann said , but they know when a game they play is well designed .
" they can recognize how beautiful the work is that went into it , " he said .

dw 's sabina matthay examines how free and fair the elections actually were . almost defiantly , the afghan foreign ministry declared that election day was a success .
indeed , there are some who say the events could pass as a trial run for democracy , as a step toward real democratic change , peace and prosperity .
on the surface it may have been a day to remember : in many provinces and towns voters lined up to elect a new president , defying the taliban and others who are so intent on destabilizing the country .
a wonderful image that was pounced on by the government , which had even attempted to impose a blackout on media coverage of violence and intimidation .
however , it was a different story in many other areas , the city of kunduz in particular was targeted relentlessly by taliban rocket attacks and at least five people were hurt there on election day .
then there are the figures : 200,000 afghan and 100,000 international security forces were dispatched to protect the polling stations - hardly the sign of a normal election day , and if those numbers ultimately fail to provide adequate security , the situation becomes even more farcical .
the violence has also overshadowed another danger overshadowing these polls , namely fraud and vote rigging .
many polling stations were forced to stay shut , not only those in the taliban-dominated south .
others may have opened , however election observers were not granted access - thus it 's almost impossible to know what happened at those polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been wide-spread allegations of vote rigging there was evidence of fraud at the last presidential election in 2004 , this time observers say the vote rigging was systematic .
it has been widely reported that incumbent - and unpopular - leader hamid karzai has absolutely no interest in being forced into a run-off poll , which could see him defeated .
as always these allegations are based on rumors and counter-rumors , however the very fact that the electoral commission , tasked with guaranteeing a free and fair poll , sent out thousands of election documents to children ineligible to vote highlights the lack of transparency and fairness , and further undermines any confidence in the government .
should these allegations be confirmed , it could spell the beginning of the end for a democratically-rooted afghanistan .

dw 's sabina matthay examines how free and fair the elections actually were . almost defiantly , the afghan foreign ministry declared that election day was a success .
indeed , there are some who say the events could pass as a trial run for democracy , as a step toward real democratic change , peace and prosperity .

a wonderful image that was pounced on by the government , which had even attempted to impose a blackout on media coverage of violence and intimidation .
however , it was a different story in many other areas , the city of kunduz in particular was targeted relentlessly by taliban rocket attacks and at least five people were hurt there on election day .
then there are the figures : 200,000 afghan and 100,000 international security forces were dispatched to protect the polling stations - hardly the sign of a normal election day , and if those numbers ultimately fail to provide adequate security , the situation becomes even more farcical .
the violence has also overshadowed another danger overshadowing these polls , namely fraud and vote rigging .
many polling stations were forced to stay shut , not only those in the taliban-dominated south .
others may have opened , however election observers were not granted access - thus it 's almost impossible to know what happened at those polling stations .

it has been widely reported that incumbent - and unpopular - leader hamid karzai has absolutely no interest in being forced into a run-off poll , which could see him defeated .
as always these allegations are based on rumors and counter-rumors , however the very fact that the electoral commission , tasked with guaranteeing a free and fair poll , sent out thousands of election documents to children ineligible to vote highlights the lack of transparency and fairness , and further undermines any confidence in the government .

officials plan to announce results next week . the afghan election authority has finished counting the majority of ballots cast and plans to announce results on tuesday .
" the counting is finished for the presidential race , " independent election commission official zekria barakzai told afp news agency .
counting for the provincial vote is continuing in kabul , nangarhar and herat , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent hamid karzai 's team says most afghans voted for him barakzai described voter turnout as " satisfactory , " estimating that between 40 to 50 percent of the roughly 17 million afghans eligible to vote went to the polls .
despite the lack of official results , the two main candidates ' campaigns both claimed victories on friday .
karzai and abdullah both confident " initial results show that the president has got a majority , " incumbent president hamid karzai 's campaign manager told reuters news agency .
" we will not go to a second round .
we have got a majority , " said deen mohammad , adding that it was up to the election commission to release official results .

however , karzai 's chief rival - former foreign minister abdullah abdullah - contested this claim .
" it is n't true , " said spokesman fazl sangcharaki .
" we also say , maybe we do n't need a second round , because abdullah has won . "
elections in afghanistan were relatively peaceful , despite taliban threats to disrupt the vote .
there were reports of sporadic violence throughout the country , with over 20 deaths on thursday .
still , the attacks were less serious than many experts had feared .
the taliban had also discouraged people from going to the polls in a bid to lower turnout and tarnish the vote 's legitimacy .
based on election commission estimates , turnout was lower than in the previous poll , in 2005. msh / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

soothsayers of the business also tried to predict the future of gaming technology . cologne is hosting the games developers conference , an industry-insider conference which ended on wednesday , and gamescom , a massive public celebration of electronic entertainment , through sunday .
one of germany 's biggest game developers , frankfurt-based crytek was there hawking its new cryengine3 software development toolset .
crytek is best known for its non-linear game-play and graphically intense action games such as " farcry " and " crysis . "
even as console gaming platforms like the xbox 360 and playstation3 have proven themselves software-selling juggernauts , the gaming industry will have to stop focusing purely on graphics to be successful , according to crytek founder cevat yerli .
building a better game video gaming graphics advances are effectively stalled for the next three years , yerli said , as maximum screen resolution is tied to the gaming console development cycle .
that means developers will have to find other ways to grab gamers ' interest .
until 2012 , crytek will rely on improving artificial intelligence , physics and special effects in order to differentiate itself from other games developers , he said .
" the online gaming market is growing fast , " said patrick lehrmann , a project manager for games academy , a school for game developers .
" and this market is not about graphics .
it 's going to be absolutely about game design . " "
instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 . " this will be a first person shooter , somewhat akin to the games that crytek has made such a name for itself in producing . but ccp is taking this model a step further . dust 514 will be a console multiplayer game , which will take place within the well-established universe of eve online . " we 're creating an fps with consequences and benefits for gamers ' actions , " richardsson said .
first person shooters tend to boast impressive graphics , and from the video ccp showed at the game 's announcement , dust will be no exception , but behind the surface of the game they plan to implement further layers of robust design .
the battles won or lost in dust will impact the eve universe and vice versa , and ccp hopes that cooperative alliances will emerge between players in the two linked games . good looks are hard to believe while games developers will always strive to look good , there are some who are re-thinking the often superficial approach to game development , such as crytek 's yerli .
" it 's better to create a believable world than a realistic world , " yerli said in an interview with deutsche welle , saying that it 's best to back away from attempting photo-realism and to create worlds that capture gamers ' attention .
most people ca n't tell the difference between the graphics in a game from seven years ago and a game from last year , lehrmann said , but they know when a game they play is well designed .
" they can recognize how beautiful the work is that went into it , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.08.2009 graphics will take a backseat to game design , story großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the games developers conference and gamescom gave players a chance to see upcoming titles the electronic entertainment industry 's heavyweights showed off their shiniest toys at the games developers conference in cologne .
soothsayers of the business also tried to predict the future of gaming technology . cologne is hosting the games developers conference , an industry-insider conference which ended on wednesday , and gamescom , a massive public celebration of electronic entertainment , through sunday .
one of germany 's biggest game developers , frankfurt-based crytek was there hawking its new cryengine3 software development toolset .
crytek is best known for its non-linear game-play and graphically intense action games such as " farcry " and " crysis . "
even as console gaming platforms like the xbox 360 and playstation3 have proven themselves software-selling juggernauts , the gaming industry will have to stop focusing purely on graphics to be successful , according to crytek founder cevat yerli .
building a better game video gaming graphics advances are effectively stalled for the next three years , yerli said , as maximum screen resolution is tied to the gaming console development cycle .
that means developers will have to find other ways to grab gamers ' interest .
until 2012 , crytek will rely on improving artificial intelligence , physics and special effects in order to differentiate itself from other games developers , he said .
" the online gaming market is growing fast , " said patrick lehrmann , a project manager for games academy , a school for game developers .
" and this market is not about graphics .
it 's going to be absolutely about game design . " "
instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 . " this will be a first person shooter , somewhat akin to the games that crytek has made such a name for itself in producing . but ccp is taking this model a step further . dust 514 will be a console multiplayer game , which will take place within the well-established universe of eve online . " we 're creating an fps with consequences and benefits for gamers ' actions , " richardsson said .
first person shooters tend to boast impressive graphics , and from the video ccp showed at the game 's announcement , dust will be no exception , but behind the surface of the game they plan to implement further layers of robust design .
the battles won or lost in dust will impact the eve universe and vice versa , and ccp hopes that cooperative alliances will emerge between players in the two linked games . good looks are hard to believe while games developers will always strive to look good , there are some who are re-thinking the often superficial approach to game development , such as crytek 's yerli .
" it 's better to create a believable world than a realistic world , " yerli said in an interview with deutsche welle , saying that it 's best to back away from attempting photo-realism and to create worlds that capture gamers ' attention .
most people ca n't tell the difference between the graphics in a game from seven years ago and a game from last year , lehrmann said , but they know when a game they play is well designed .
" they can recognize how beautiful the work is that went into it , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.08.2009 graphics will take a backseat to game design , story großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the games developers conference and gamescom gave players a chance to see upcoming titles the electronic entertainment industry 's heavyweights showed off their shiniest toys at the games developers conference in cologne .
soothsayers of the business also tried to predict the future of gaming technology . cologne is hosting the games developers conference , an industry-insider conference which ended on wednesday , and gamescom , a massive public celebration of electronic entertainment , through sunday .
one of germany 's biggest game developers , frankfurt-based crytek was there hawking its new cryengine3 software development toolset .
crytek is best known for its non-linear game-play and graphically intense action games such as " farcry " and " crysis . "
even as console gaming platforms like the xbox 360 and playstation3 have proven themselves software-selling juggernauts , the gaming industry will have to stop focusing purely on graphics to be successful , according to crytek founder cevat yerli .
building a better game video gaming graphics advances are effectively stalled for the next three years , yerli said , as maximum screen resolution is tied to the gaming console development cycle .
that means developers will have to find other ways to grab gamers ' interest .
until 2012 , crytek will rely on improving artificial intelligence , physics and special effects in order to differentiate itself from other games developers , he said .
" the online gaming market is growing fast , " said patrick lehrmann , a project manager for games academy , a school for game developers .
" and this market is not about graphics .
it 's going to be absolutely about game design . " "
instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 . " this will be a first person shooter , somewhat akin to the games that crytek has made such a name for itself in producing . but ccp is taking this model a step further . dust 514 will be a console multiplayer game , which will take place within the well-established universe of eve online . " we 're creating an fps with consequences and benefits for gamers ' actions , " richardsson said .
first person shooters tend to boast impressive graphics , and from the video ccp showed at the game 's announcement , dust will be no exception , but behind the surface of the game they plan to implement further layers of robust design .
the battles won or lost in dust will impact the eve universe and vice versa , and ccp hopes that cooperative alliances will emerge between players in the two linked games . good looks are hard to believe while games developers will always strive to look good , there are some who are re-thinking the often superficial approach to game development , such as crytek 's yerli .
" it 's better to create a believable world than a realistic world , " yerli said in an interview with deutsche welle , saying that it 's best to back away from attempting photo-realism and to create worlds that capture gamers ' attention .
most people ca n't tell the difference between the graphics in a game from seven years ago and a game from last year , lehrmann said , but they know when a game they play is well designed .
" they can recognize how beautiful the work is that went into it , " he said .

the ruling allows frankfurt airport to add a new runway and terminal as well as cargo and maintenance facilities .
the decision is a setback for environmentalists opposed to the destruction of forest land . europe 's third busiest airport is set to become much bigger , after a regional court 's decision on friday to allow frankfurt international airport to proceed with a 4 billion euro -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- expansion plan .
the regional administrative court for the state of hesse in the western city of kassel said it had received more than 200 complaints against the airport 's plans , but ruled that the potential economic benefit outweighed residents ' concerns about noise and destruction of a nearby forest .
several of the opposing parties said they planned to appeal to a federal court .
the airport will now begin construction of a fourth runway , a third terminal , and a cargo and maintenance base .
a press release on the fraport website indicated that the new runway would be scheduled to open in 2011 .
the court upheld existing restrictions on night flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m.
traffic at frankfurt 's airport is expected to rise to 88.6 million passengers by 2020 , up from 53.5 million in 2008. svs / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the assassination of siegfried buback , a strong opponent of the left-wing extremist terrorist group , marked the beginning of a wave of terrorist acts by the raf in their radical opposition to the west german government .
it remained one of the highest-profile political killings carried out by the raf throughout the militant group 's campaign .
buback , his driver wolfgang goebel , and georg wurster , a court officer , were all shot dead on the way to the court house in karlsruhe .
a motorcycle pulled up to buback 's mercedes when it stopped at a traffic light , and a passenger on the back opened fire with an automatic weapon .
eyewitnesses claimed the shooter had a slight build , suggesting a female assailant .
investigators , however , focused on raf member stefan wisniewski , who ex-terrorist peter-juergen boock had implicated as the possible shooter .
the federal prosecutor 's office said thursday that while the discovery of becker 's dna on the envelopes meant that she could not be ruled out as the assassin , it was not conclusive evidence in itself .
further investigations would follow .
new twist in on-going investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verena becker in an undated police the new revelations come only a year after dna testing on a motorcycle glove , helmet and jacket found after buback 's death had ruled out any connection to becker , who was released from jail some 20 years ago after serving several years for raf-related crimes .
former raf members christian klar , knut folkerts , guenter sonnenberg and brigitte mohnhaupt were convicted collectively of the buback murder , but authorities remain unsure of who fired the deadly shots .
michael buback , the son of the murdered prosecutor , had repeatedly named verena becker as a possible suspect .
" i am relieved that the efforts to clarify the details of the karlsruhe assassination have been resumed , " michael buback told reporters. nda / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 21.08.2009 schalke tops bundesliga for now after draw at hoffenheim großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim 's sejad salihovic , left , duels with schalke 's kevin kuranyi for the ball in the first game of the weekend , schalke was held to a draw by hoffenheim , while on saturday champions wolfsburg face their toughest challenge of the season when hamburg visits . felix magath 's schalke lost their 100 percent record on friday night when it tied 0-0 with host hoffenheim .
the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .
" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .
the nigerian missed training on wednesday with a cold , but is expected to recover by sunday , probably to take a place on the bench .
bayern looking for first win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is frustrated by his team 's sluggish start bayern munich , meanwhile , will be looking for a first victory after two draws under dutch coach louis van gaal when they travel to promoted mainz on saturday .
van gaal will be without the injured martin demichelis in defense and captain mark van bommel in midfield , but is hoping french international franck ribery will be available .
ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .
the arrival of gomez and olic seems to have relegated toni to the bench but chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has warned against writing off the 32-year-old .

the assassination of siegfried buback , a strong opponent of the left-wing extremist terrorist group , marked the beginning of a wave of terrorist acts by the raf in their radical opposition to the west german government .
it remained one of the highest-profile political killings carried out by the raf throughout the militant group 's campaign .
buback , his driver wolfgang goebel , and georg wurster , a court officer , were all shot dead on the way to the court house in karlsruhe .
a motorcycle pulled up to buback 's mercedes when it stopped at a traffic light , and a passenger on the back opened fire with an automatic weapon .
eyewitnesses claimed the shooter had a slight build , suggesting a female assailant .
investigators , however , focused on raf member stefan wisniewski , who ex-terrorist peter-juergen boock had implicated as the possible shooter .
the federal prosecutor 's office said thursday that while the discovery of becker 's dna on the envelopes meant that she could not be ruled out as the assassin , it was not conclusive evidence in itself .
further investigations would follow .
new twist in on-going investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verena becker in an undated police the new revelations come only a year after dna testing on a motorcycle glove , helmet and jacket found after buback 's death had ruled out any connection to becker , who was released from jail some 20 years ago after serving several years for raf-related crimes .
former raf members christian klar , knut folkerts , guenter sonnenberg and brigitte mohnhaupt were convicted collectively of the buback murder , but authorities remain unsure of who fired the deadly shots .
michael buback , the son of the murdered prosecutor , had repeatedly named verena becker as a possible suspect .
" i am relieved that the efforts to clarify the details of the karlsruhe assassination have been resumed , " michael buback told reporters. nda / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .
" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .
the nigerian missed training on wednesday with a cold , but is expected to recover by sunday , probably to take a place on the bench .
bayern looking for first win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is frustrated by his team 's sluggish start bayern munich , meanwhile , will be looking for a first victory after two draws under dutch coach louis van gaal when they travel to promoted mainz on saturday .
van gaal will be without the injured martin demichelis in defense and captain mark van bommel in midfield , but is hoping french international franck ribery will be available .
ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .
the arrival of gomez and olic seems to have relegated toni to the bench but chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has warned against writing off the 32-year-old .
" he is mentally strong and i am convinced that after returning from italy he will be training hard and working on his comeback .
i think we 'll still have a lot of fun with him in munich , " he said .
basement battlers looking for first points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince poldi 's return to cologne has not been a happy one at the other end of the table the arrival of striker lukas podolski from bayern has not translated to points for cologne who are bottom following two defeats ahead of saturday 's visit by eintracht frankfurt .
cologne will feel it 's a must-win game as tough matches follow against hamburg , schalke , stuttgart , bayer leverkusen and bayern munich .
" we have to stay calm and not get hectic .
we have shown that we can match opponents like wolfsburg -lrb- a 3-1 home defeat -rrb- .
but the two first games have shown that it 's going to be a tough season , " podolski told kicker sports magazine .
hanover , who visit nuremberg on saturday , are also looking for a first win as well as a new coach after dieter hecking threw in the towel late wednesday .
werder bremen - boosted by the signing of last season 's on-loan striker claudio pizarro - are another side seeking a first win , with borussia moenchengladbach the visitors on sunday .
borussia dortmund and stuttgart - both fancied to do well this season - meet on saturday , while leverkusen are at promoted freiburg in the day 's other game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.08.2009 graphics will take a backseat to game design , story großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the games developers conference and gamescom gave players a chance to see upcoming titles the electronic entertainment industry 's heavyweights showed off their shiniest toys at the games developers conference in cologne .
soothsayers of the business also tried to predict the future of gaming technology . cologne is hosting the games developers conference , an industry-insider conference which ended on wednesday , and gamescom , a massive public celebration of electronic entertainment , through sunday .
one of germany 's biggest game developers , frankfurt-based crytek was there hawking its new cryengine3 software development toolset .
crytek is best known for its non-linear game-play and graphically intense action games such as " farcry " and " crysis . "
even as console gaming platforms like the xbox 360 and playstation3 have proven themselves software-selling juggernauts , the gaming industry will have to stop focusing purely on graphics to be successful , according to crytek founder cevat yerli .
building a better game video gaming graphics advances are effectively stalled for the next three years , yerli said , as maximum screen resolution is tied to the gaming console development cycle .
that means developers will have to find other ways to grab gamers ' interest .
until 2012 , crytek will rely on improving artificial intelligence , physics and special effects in order to differentiate itself from other games developers , he said .
" the online gaming market is growing fast , " said patrick lehrmann , a project manager for games academy , a school for game developers .
" and this market is not about graphics .
it 's going to be absolutely about game design . " "
instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 . " this will be a first person shooter , somewhat akin to the games that crytek has made such a name for itself in producing . but ccp is taking this model a step further . dust 514 will be a console multiplayer game , which will take place within the well-established universe of eve online . " we 're creating an fps with consequences and benefits for gamers ' actions , " richardsson said .
first person shooters tend to boast impressive graphics , and from the video ccp showed at the game 's announcement , dust will be no exception , but behind the surface of the game they plan to implement further layers of robust design .
the battles won or lost in dust will impact the eve universe and vice versa , and ccp hopes that cooperative alliances will emerge between players in the two linked games . good looks are hard to believe while games developers will always strive to look good , there are some who are re-thinking the often superficial approach to game development , such as crytek 's yerli .
" it 's better to create a believable world than a realistic world , " yerli said in an interview with deutsche welle , saying that it 's best to back away from attempting photo-realism and to create worlds that capture gamers ' attention .
most people ca n't tell the difference between the graphics in a game from seven years ago and a game from last year , lehrmann said , but they know when a game they play is well designed .
" they can recognize how beautiful the work is that went into it , " he said .

the assassination of siegfried buback , a strong opponent of the left-wing extremist terrorist group , marked the beginning of a wave of terrorist acts by the raf in their radical opposition to the west german government .
it remained one of the highest-profile political killings carried out by the raf throughout the militant group 's campaign .
buback , his driver wolfgang goebel , and georg wurster , a court officer , were all shot dead on the way to the court house in karlsruhe .
a motorcycle pulled up to buback 's mercedes when it stopped at a traffic light , and a passenger on the back opened fire with an automatic weapon .
eyewitnesses claimed the shooter had a slight build , suggesting a female assailant .
investigators , however , focused on raf member stefan wisniewski , who ex-terrorist peter-juergen boock had implicated as the possible shooter .
the federal prosecutor 's office said thursday that while the discovery of becker 's dna on the envelopes meant that she could not be ruled out as the assassin , it was not conclusive evidence in itself .
further investigations would follow .
new twist in on-going investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verena becker in an undated police the new revelations come only a year after dna testing on a motorcycle glove , helmet and jacket found after buback 's death had ruled out any connection to becker , who was released from jail some 20 years ago after serving several years for raf-related crimes .
former raf members christian klar , knut folkerts , guenter sonnenberg and brigitte mohnhaupt were convicted collectively of the buback murder , but authorities remain unsure of who fired the deadly shots .
michael buback , the son of the murdered prosecutor , had repeatedly named verena becker as a possible suspect .
" i am relieved that the efforts to clarify the details of the karlsruhe assassination have been resumed , " michael buback told reporters. nda / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .
" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .
the nigerian missed training on wednesday with a cold , but is expected to recover by sunday , probably to take a place on the bench .
bayern looking for first win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is frustrated by his team 's sluggish start bayern munich , meanwhile , will be looking for a first victory after two draws under dutch coach louis van gaal when they travel to promoted mainz on saturday .
van gaal will be without the injured martin demichelis in defense and captain mark van bommel in midfield , but is hoping french international franck ribery will be available .
ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .
the arrival of gomez and olic seems to have relegated toni to the bench but chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has warned against writing off the 32-year-old .

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .
" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .
the nigerian missed training on wednesday with a cold , but is expected to recover by sunday , probably to take a place on the bench .
bayern looking for first win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is frustrated by his team 's sluggish start bayern munich , meanwhile , will be looking for a first victory after two draws under dutch coach louis van gaal when they travel to promoted mainz on saturday .
van gaal will be without the injured martin demichelis in defense and captain mark van bommel in midfield , but is hoping french international franck ribery will be available .
ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .
the arrival of gomez and olic seems to have relegated toni to the bench but chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has warned against writing off the 32-year-old .
" he is mentally strong and i am convinced that after returning from italy he will be training hard and working on his comeback .
i think we 'll still have a lot of fun with him in munich , " he said .

access is granted via application . wwii restitution an issue art theft is a worldwide problem ; in germany , stories of art theft often center around art that was looted from its owners amid the oppression and chaos of world war ii . during that time , " a relocation of cultural items took place whose full scope has still not been completely explored and investigated , " according to the coordination office for lost cultural assets , located in magdeburg . the nazis , the soviet trophy commissions , and individual allied military personnel all perpetrated art theft .
artworks and artifacts were also removed or relocated to protect them during wartime and are now located on foreign territory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a public database , art buyers ca n't claim ignorance in june , 46 countries signed the terezin declaration , vowing to increase their efforts to return more of the estimated 650,000 works of art stolen from european jews during the holocaust . the new interpol database could be of help in the search for these and other objects stolen in any of the agency 's 187 member countries . the information in the database will consist of descriptions and photographs of stolen cultural goods , according to karl hein kind , who coordinates the works of art department of interpol based in lyon , france . ' a barrier for traffickers ' contribution and access to the database represents " an important tool to counter the traffic in cultural property effectively , " kind said . all of interpol 's member countries will contribute information , he added . the agency hopes that by opening up access to the database to the public and to concerned cultural and professional bodies such as ministries of culture , museums , auction houses , art galleries , foundations , and collectors , it will be that much more difficult for a seller or purchaser to claim not having had the opportunity to check whether an item was recorded as stolen . " extensive online access to the database -lrb- … -rrb- represents an important barrier to the illicit trafficking of a stolen cultural object by making its sale more difficult , " kind said . victorine stille works for the art loss register , an international company that also keeps an online database of stolen art .
their company also keeps a database of stolen goods , and takes a fee for checking on the provenance of artworks - for buyers who want to be sure about their art investments , for example . she agrees on the importance of transparency when it comes to stolen art , and welcomes the presence of another international art register . " the art loss register has always worked very closely with interpol and other police agencies , " stille said . " both of our aims is to solve art crimes ... interpol is helping to create public awareness of the problem .
its good that they 've made the database available to everyone because now people ca n't hide anymore by saying ' oh , we did n't know .

that leaves germany as a lone voice against the " monopolization " and " americanization " of european culture . paris ' bibliotheque nationale de france -lrb- bnf -rrb- said thursday that it is in talks with google over the possibility of allowing the california-based internet giant to scan a portion of its 30 million books and documents , making them available free of charge on the internet . thirty libraries , including renowned university institutions at harvard , princeton and oxford , are already involved in the project , which aims to digitalize both out-of-print books as well as publications that are currently on the market . germany rejects google plan if the influential bnf reaches an agreement with google , it would mean a significant blow to the german government 's adamant stance against the book search project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has said it intends to scan only excerpts of books currently on the market " i have protested against google and will continue to do so , as long as copyrighted works are scanned without the prior approval of the author , " bernd neumann , germany 's minister of culture , said thursday . in the us , google has reached a legal agreement with publishing houses , according to which they receive a lump sum for the books offered up for scanning .
the authors themselves are not consulted . also on thursday , the german publishers and booksellers association issued a statement welcoming the digitalization of copyright-free material .
however , it criticized the european commission and the major participating eu states for supporting the google project . " states are being negligent with their cultural heritage when they turn it over to a monopolist and thereby run tax-funded projects like the european digital library europeana into the ground , " said alexander skipis , the association 's director . brussels gives its blessing launched in november 2008 , the europeana digital library offers users access to some two million digital objects including film material , photos , maps , books , newspapers and other documents . eu commissioner for information , society and media , vivane reding , told german daily handelsblatt that 90 percent of all archived books worldwide were no longer in print and therefore not accessible to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bavarian state library is the only one in germany to make a deal with google " it 's good that new business models are developed to bring this content to the consumers , " said reding , adding that digitalization was an expensive undertaking that could n't be borne by governments alone . french library reconsiders the bnf has a digitalization project of its own , with 100,000 books and rare documents being scanned each year over a course of three years .
these are available on the french web site gallica . in 2005 , bnf 's director at the time , jean-noel jeanneney , was adamantly opposed to the budding google project , which he viewed as the americanization of european culture . though the german government is unyielding in its opposition to the mass digitalization endeavor , one library in germany - the bavarian state library in munich - has signed a contract with google . france 's change of heart on the matter is another thorn in the side of germany 's ministry of culture . kjb / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ruling allows frankfurt airport to add a new runway and terminal as well as cargo and maintenance facilities .
the decision is a setback for environmentalists opposed to the destruction of forest land . europe 's third busiest airport is set to become much bigger , after a regional court 's decision on friday to allow frankfurt international airport to proceed with a 4 billion euro -lrb- $ 5.7 billion -rrb- expansion plan .
the regional administrative court for the state of hesse in the western city of kassel said it had received more than 200 complaints against the airport 's plans , but ruled that the potential economic benefit outweighed residents ' concerns about noise and destruction of a nearby forest .
several of the opposing parties said they planned to appeal to a federal court .
the airport will now begin construction of a fourth runway , a third terminal , and a cargo and maintenance base .
a press release on the fraport website indicated that the new runway would be scheduled to open in 2011 .
the court upheld existing restrictions on night flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m.
traffic at frankfurt 's airport is expected to rise to 88.6 million passengers by 2020 , up from 53.5 million in 2008. svs / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.08.2009 graphics will take a backseat to game design , story großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the games developers conference and gamescom gave players a chance to see upcoming titles the electronic entertainment industry 's heavyweights showed off their shiniest toys at the games developers conference in cologne .
soothsayers of the business also tried to predict the future of gaming technology . cologne is hosting the games developers conference , an industry-insider conference which ended on wednesday , and gamescom , a massive public celebration of electronic entertainment , through sunday .
one of germany 's biggest game developers , frankfurt-based crytek was there hawking its new cryengine3 software development toolset .
crytek is best known for its non-linear game-play and graphically intense action games such as " farcry " and " crysis . "
even as console gaming platforms like the xbox 360 and playstation3 have proven themselves software-selling juggernauts , the gaming industry will have to stop focusing purely on graphics to be successful , according to crytek founder cevat yerli .
building a better game video gaming graphics advances are effectively stalled for the next three years , yerli said , as maximum screen resolution is tied to the gaming console development cycle .
that means developers will have to find other ways to grab gamers ' interest .
until 2012 , crytek will rely on improving artificial intelligence , physics and special effects in order to differentiate itself from other games developers , he said .
" the online gaming market is growing fast , " said patrick lehrmann , a project manager for games academy , a school for game developers .
" and this market is not about graphics .
it 's going to be absolutely about game design . " "
instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 . " this will be a first person shooter , somewhat akin to the games that crytek has made such a name for itself in producing . but ccp is taking this model a step further . dust 514 will be a console multiplayer game , which will take place within the well-established universe of eve online . " we 're creating an fps with consequences and benefits for gamers ' actions , " richardsson said .
first person shooters tend to boast impressive graphics , and from the video ccp showed at the game 's announcement , dust will be no exception , but behind the surface of the game they plan to implement further layers of robust design .
the battles won or lost in dust will impact the eve universe and vice versa , and ccp hopes that cooperative alliances will emerge between players in the two linked games . good looks are hard to believe while games developers will always strive to look good , there are some who are re-thinking the often superficial approach to game development , such as crytek 's yerli .
" it 's better to create a believable world than a realistic world , " yerli said in an interview with deutsche welle , saying that it 's best to back away from attempting photo-realism and to create worlds that capture gamers ' attention .
most people ca n't tell the difference between the graphics in a game from seven years ago and a game from last year , lehrmann said , but they know when a game they play is well designed .
" they can recognize how beautiful the work is that went into it , " he said .

the system works by reflecting the light from 2,153 mirrors to a 22-square-meter -lrb- 239-square-foot -rrb- ceramic receptor atop a 60-meter tower .
the steam produced as gas in the receptor heats up to over 700 degrees celsius -lrb- 1,292 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and powers a turbine that is used to generate power .

" despite receiving some 10.6 million euros of funding from the federal and two state governments , the array 's potential will likely not be realized in germany , but in sunnier regions closer to the equator , thoben said . german environment minister sigmar gabriel added that the new solar project would help solidify germany 's expertise in the renewable energy market . " we are creating the technical requirements for solar power to be delivered from the desert , " he said .
" thanks to these kinds of technical investments we are prepared to be a leader in a driving market of the future .

dw 's sabina matthay examines how free and fair the elections actually were . almost defiantly , the afghan foreign ministry declared that election day was a success .
indeed , there are some who say the events could pass as a trial run for democracy , as a step toward real democratic change , peace and prosperity .
on the surface it may have been a day to remember : in many provinces and towns voters lined up to elect a new president , defying the taliban and others who are so intent on destabilizing the country .
a wonderful image that was pounced on by the government , which had even attempted to impose a blackout on media coverage of violence and intimidation .
however , it was a different story in many other areas , the city of kunduz in particular was targeted relentlessly by taliban rocket attacks and at least five people were hurt there on election day .
then there are the figures : 200,000 afghan and 100,000 international security forces were dispatched to protect the polling stations - hardly the sign of a normal election day , and if those numbers ultimately fail to provide adequate security , the situation becomes even more farcical .
the violence has also overshadowed another danger overshadowing these polls , namely fraud and vote rigging .
many polling stations were forced to stay shut , not only those in the taliban-dominated south .
others may have opened , however election observers were not granted access - thus it 's almost impossible to know what happened at those polling stations .

dw 's sabina matthay examines how free and fair the elections actually were . almost defiantly , the afghan foreign ministry declared that election day was a success .
indeed , there are some who say the events could pass as a trial run for democracy , as a step toward real democratic change , peace and prosperity .
on the surface it may have been a day to remember : in many provinces and towns voters lined up to elect a new president , defying the taliban and others who are so intent on destabilizing the country .
a wonderful image that was pounced on by the government , which had even attempted to impose a blackout on media coverage of violence and intimidation .
however , it was a different story in many other areas , the city of kunduz in particular was targeted relentlessly by taliban rocket attacks and at least five people were hurt there on election day .
then there are the figures : 200,000 afghan and 100,000 international security forces were dispatched to protect the polling stations - hardly the sign of a normal election day , and if those numbers ultimately fail to provide adequate security , the situation becomes even more farcical .
the violence has also overshadowed another danger overshadowing these polls , namely fraud and vote rigging .
many polling stations were forced to stay shut , not only those in the taliban-dominated south .
others may have opened , however election observers were not granted access - thus it 's almost impossible to know what happened at those polling stations .

access is granted via application . wwii restitution an issue art theft is a worldwide problem ; in germany , stories of art theft often center around art that was looted from its owners amid the oppression and chaos of world war ii . during that time , " a relocation of cultural items took place whose full scope has still not been completely explored and investigated , " according to the coordination office for lost cultural assets , located in magdeburg . the nazis , the soviet trophy commissions , and individual allied military personnel all perpetrated art theft .
artworks and artifacts were also removed or relocated to protect them during wartime and are now located on foreign territory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a public database , art buyers ca n't claim ignorance in june , 46 countries signed the terezin declaration , vowing to increase their efforts to return more of the estimated 650,000 works of art stolen from european jews during the holocaust . the new interpol database could be of help in the search for these and other objects stolen in any of the agency 's 187 member countries . the information in the database will consist of descriptions and photographs of stolen cultural goods , according to karl hein kind , who coordinates the works of art department of interpol based in lyon , france . ' a barrier for traffickers ' contribution and access to the database represents " an important tool to counter the traffic in cultural property effectively , " kind said . all of interpol 's member countries will contribute information , he added . the agency hopes that by opening up access to the database to the public and to concerned cultural and professional bodies such as ministries of culture , museums , auction houses , art galleries , foundations , and collectors , it will be that much more difficult for a seller or purchaser to claim not having had the opportunity to check whether an item was recorded as stolen . " extensive online access to the database -lrb- … -rrb- represents an important barrier to the illicit trafficking of a stolen cultural object by making its sale more difficult , " kind said . victorine stille works for the art loss register , an international company that also keeps an online database of stolen art .
their company also keeps a database of stolen goods , and takes a fee for checking on the provenance of artworks - for buyers who want to be sure about their art investments , for example . she agrees on the importance of transparency when it comes to stolen art , and welcomes the presence of another international art register . " the art loss register has always worked very closely with interpol and other police agencies , " stille said . " both of our aims is to solve art crimes ... interpol is helping to create public awareness of the problem .
its good that they 've made the database available to everyone because now people ca n't hide anymore by saying ' oh , we did n't know .

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .
" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .
the nigerian missed training on wednesday with a cold , but is expected to recover by sunday , probably to take a place on the bench .
bayern looking for first win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is frustrated by his team 's sluggish start bayern munich , meanwhile , will be looking for a first victory after two draws under dutch coach louis van gaal when they travel to promoted mainz on saturday .
van gaal will be without the injured martin demichelis in defense and captain mark van bommel in midfield , but is hoping french international franck ribery will be available .
ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .
the arrival of gomez and olic seems to have relegated toni to the bench but chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has warned against writing off the 32-year-old .
" he is mentally strong and i am convinced that after returning from italy he will be training hard and working on his comeback .
i think we 'll still have a lot of fun with him in munich , " he said .
basement battlers looking for first points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince poldi 's return to cologne has not been a happy one at the other end of the table the arrival of striker lukas podolski from bayern has not translated to points for cologne who are bottom following two defeats ahead of saturday 's visit by eintracht frankfurt .
cologne will feel it 's a must-win game as tough matches follow against hamburg , schalke , stuttgart , bayer leverkusen and bayern munich .
" we have to stay calm and not get hectic .
we have shown that we can match opponents like wolfsburg -lrb- a 3-1 home defeat -rrb- .
but the two first games have shown that it 's going to be a tough season , " podolski told kicker sports magazine .
hanover , who visit nuremberg on saturday , are also looking for a first win as well as a new coach after dieter hecking threw in the towel late wednesday .
werder bremen - boosted by the signing of last season 's on-loan striker claudio pizarro - are another side seeking a first win , with borussia moenchengladbach the visitors on sunday .
borussia dortmund and stuttgart - both fancied to do well this season - meet on saturday , while leverkusen are at promoted freiburg in the day 's other game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 21.08.2009 asia needs water reforms : expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water scarcity affects agriculture and can subsequently cause food crisis the annual international conference on water issues , the " world water week " has ended in stockholm .
india 's sanitation pioneer bindeshwar pathak is this year 's winner of the prestigious stockholm water prize for his simple toilet system which is used in india and other countries .
during the conference , experts highlighted asia 's need to improve irrigation to feed its growing population . asia must improve its irrigation and farming processes to ward off food scarcity and social disorder , a joint study by the international water management institute and the un food and agriculture organisation fao says .
colin charters , the director general of the international water management institute explains : “ the critical issue is that if we get more frequent food crises , these food crises mean that people 's livelihoods are affected on farms , people 's nourishment is affected .
these things can lead to social unrest within countries .
that social unrest can be capitalised on by disruptive elements .
and where we see this kind of hardship , we tend to see people wanting to migrate out of the region . ”
meeting food needs the best way to avoid this scenario is of course to make sure people are well fed and happy in their own country .
the report describes three options for meeting the food needs of asia .
the first is to import huge quantities of cereals from other regions - but the report foretells that this is politically too risky .
the second option would be to improve and expand rain-fed agriculture - largely impractical , as suitable land is already in use in many areas .
the only remaining solution therefore is to focus on irrigated farmlands .
the report says that for this , the irrigation systems in asia need to be revitalised .
water reforms charters calls for major water reforms to increase food supply in asia .
“ the steps needed are : one , recognition of the problem by the powers-that-be like the politicians ; two , reform of the institutions that manage water and the way water is governed particularly making sure that people ’ s rights to water are recognised in law and legislation , making sure that those rights protect the water for the farmers .
on farms and in irrigation systems technical reforms are needed which will increase productivity - meaning that farmers will benefit , not only by growing more , they 'll also get more profit . ”
charters urges that asian governments must help the farmers implement these reforms : “ one of the things they can do is to encourage capacity building in farmers , teaching them new techniques , helping them through investments and availability of micro-finance in higher-tech types of irrigation technology such as drippers and sometimes sprinklers .
all these things use less water and increase productivity . ”
besides , charters thinks harvesting rain water and making it available for irrigation will be a good idea for developing countries to adopt so as to save precious ground water .
experts warn that water shortages in asia will probably be further aggravated by climate change , which is likely to make rainfall more irregular .

despite measures to abolish slavery worldwide , human trafficking and forced labour remain very evident across the globe .
poor people , who come to foreign countries in search of a better life , are the most vulnerable .
christina from myanmar is one of the many who have been subjected to human rights violations . in the fall of 2003 , christina came to the us with new dreams in her eyes .
in her country myanmar , she saw little hope .
as a member of the indian minority community and as a christian in a predominantly buddhist country , she often felt like an outsider .
her success at school was the only respite to compensate for the discrimination she was experiencing almost everyday .
then she got admission into an american university .
a future full of hopes for her .
“ i knew that i was going to do well in the school , ” she says .
“ i was 19 and i had plans to finish school in four years , go on peace corps , help out people , and come back , do my graduate school .
so i had my life planned out already ahead of time . ”
turn of events but her life changed soon .
from a confident student , she became a victim of economic exploitation .
she had to work at her aunt ’ s restaurant in the us .
“ for about a month , life was good .
and then it started changing gradually , " says christina .
“ i was pressured into doing a lot of things that i didn ’ t want to do .
first of all , i worked for her business , so i was i already spending time outside the house with her , for her and then i would come home and put up with the family , having to take care of all the chores and things around .
it was like 24/7 .
i was a slave . ”
christina did not resist .
her cultural background demanded an unconditional obedience to elders .
forced labour for the university , she had less and less time .
and because her aunt ’ s restaurant was not running well , she had no money for her tuition fees either .
as a result , christina had to stop her studies .
with this , she automatically lost her residence permit and was forced into staying illegally in the united states .
she was now completely dependent on her aunt : “ i would get up around 6 , sometimes 7 , if i was very tired .
i 'd spend an hour on the road just to get to the restaurant , just to make sure that everything was ok before we opened and then go back in the kitchen and then start cooking and cleaning without a break .
i mean i would stop to eat but that ’ s pretty much all i had . ”
verbal and physical abuse the other employees at the restaurant were given a proper wage .
but christina didn ’ t even get a cent .
instead , she was assaulted verbally and at times physically .
amid fear of deportation , she did not know whom she could turn to for help .
she might have continued to work for her aunt , until one night , when her drunken uncle became too intrusive .
in panic and fear christina grabbed her belongings and left the house .
help from an organisation she was fortunate .
her immediate neighbour helped her and brought her into contact with the relief organization , " break the chain campaign " , where she got legal advice and help .
qimmah najeeullah , the director of the organization , explains : “ i think we all underestimate the power of the psychological version .
often times the trafficker or the employers explain the world to be really different than what it really is .
they will say : you see all the violence in the news .
oh !
that could be you . and it is natural for you to want to be in an environment that is safe .
and if you know it is an abuse and it is a limitation , it is still more comfortable than what you don ’ t know . ”
as a victim of trafficking christina was actually entitled to a so-called t-visa which could have legalised her stay in the u.s. but she refused to take it , as this could have meant that she stood as a witness against her aunt .
she is now married to a us citizen and is a green card holder .
she is also looking forward to her return to university .

india 's sanitation pioneer bindeshwar pathak is this year 's winner of the prestigious stockholm water prize for his simple toilet system which is used in india and other countries .
during the conference , experts highlighted asia 's need to improve irrigation to feed its growing population . asia must improve its irrigation and farming processes to ward off food scarcity and social disorder , a joint study by the international water management institute and the un food and agriculture organisation fao says .
colin charters , the director general of the international water management institute explains : “ the critical issue is that if we get more frequent food crises , these food crises mean that people 's livelihoods are affected on farms , people 's nourishment is affected .
these things can lead to social unrest within countries .
that social unrest can be capitalised on by disruptive elements .
and where we see this kind of hardship , we tend to see people wanting to migrate out of the region . ”
meeting food needs the best way to avoid this scenario is of course to make sure people are well fed and happy in their own country .
the report describes three options for meeting the food needs of asia .
the first is to import huge quantities of cereals from other regions - but the report foretells that this is politically too risky .
the second option would be to improve and expand rain-fed agriculture - largely impractical , as suitable land is already in use in many areas .
the only remaining solution therefore is to focus on irrigated farmlands .
the report says that for this , the irrigation systems in asia need to be revitalised .
water reforms charters calls for major water reforms to increase food supply in asia .
“ the steps needed are : one , recognition of the problem by the powers-that-be like the politicians ; two , reform of the institutions that manage water and the way water is governed particularly making sure that people ’ s rights to water are recognised in law and legislation , making sure that those rights protect the water for the farmers .
on farms and in irrigation systems technical reforms are needed which will increase productivity - meaning that farmers will benefit , not only by growing more , they 'll also get more profit . ”
charters urges that asian governments must help the farmers implement these reforms : “ one of the things they can do is to encourage capacity building in farmers , teaching them new techniques , helping them through investments and availability of micro-finance in higher-tech types of irrigation technology such as drippers and sometimes sprinklers .
all these things use less water and increase productivity . ”
besides , charters thinks harvesting rain water and making it available for irrigation will be a good idea for developing countries to adopt so as to save precious ground water .
experts warn that water shortages in asia will probably be further aggravated by climate change , which is likely to make rainfall more irregular .

india 's sanitation pioneer bindeshwar pathak is this year 's winner of the prestigious stockholm water prize for his simple toilet system which is used in india and other countries .
during the conference , experts highlighted asia 's need to improve irrigation to feed its growing population . asia must improve its irrigation and farming processes to ward off food scarcity and social disorder , a joint study by the international water management institute and the un food and agriculture organisation fao says .
colin charters , the director general of the international water management institute explains : “ the critical issue is that if we get more frequent food crises , these food crises mean that people 's livelihoods are affected on farms , people 's nourishment is affected .
these things can lead to social unrest within countries .
that social unrest can be capitalised on by disruptive elements .
and where we see this kind of hardship , we tend to see people wanting to migrate out of the region . ”
meeting food needs the best way to avoid this scenario is of course to make sure people are well fed and happy in their own country .
the report describes three options for meeting the food needs of asia .
the first is to import huge quantities of cereals from other regions - but the report foretells that this is politically too risky .
the second option would be to improve and expand rain-fed agriculture - largely impractical , as suitable land is already in use in many areas .
the only remaining solution therefore is to focus on irrigated farmlands .
the report says that for this , the irrigation systems in asia need to be revitalised .
water reforms charters calls for major water reforms to increase food supply in asia .
“ the steps needed are : one , recognition of the problem by the powers-that-be like the politicians ; two , reform of the institutions that manage water and the way water is governed particularly making sure that people ’ s rights to water are recognised in law and legislation , making sure that those rights protect the water for the farmers .
on farms and in irrigation systems technical reforms are needed which will increase productivity - meaning that farmers will benefit , not only by growing more , they 'll also get more profit . ”
charters urges that asian governments must help the farmers implement these reforms : “ one of the things they can do is to encourage capacity building in farmers , teaching them new techniques , helping them through investments and availability of micro-finance in higher-tech types of irrigation technology such as drippers and sometimes sprinklers .
all these things use less water and increase productivity . ”
besides , charters thinks harvesting rain water and making it available for irrigation will be a good idea for developing countries to adopt so as to save precious ground water .
experts warn that water shortages in asia will probably be further aggravated by climate change , which is likely to make rainfall more irregular .

despite measures to abolish slavery worldwide , human trafficking and forced labour remain very evident across the globe .
poor people , who come to foreign countries in search of a better life , are the most vulnerable .
christina from myanmar is one of the many who have been subjected to human rights violations . in the fall of 2003 , christina came to the us with new dreams in her eyes .
in her country myanmar , she saw little hope .
as a member of the indian minority community and as a christian in a predominantly buddhist country , she often felt like an outsider .
her success at school was the only respite to compensate for the discrimination she was experiencing almost everyday .
then she got admission into an american university .
a future full of hopes for her .
“ i knew that i was going to do well in the school , ” she says .
“ i was 19 and i had plans to finish school in four years , go on peace corps , help out people , and come back , do my graduate school .
so i had my life planned out already ahead of time . ”
turn of events but her life changed soon .
from a confident student , she became a victim of economic exploitation .
she had to work at her aunt ’ s restaurant in the us .
“ for about a month , life was good .
and then it started changing gradually , " says christina .
“ i was pressured into doing a lot of things that i didn ’ t want to do .
first of all , i worked for her business , so i was i already spending time outside the house with her , for her and then i would come home and put up with the family , having to take care of all the chores and things around .
it was like 24/7 .
i was a slave . ”
christina did not resist .
her cultural background demanded an unconditional obedience to elders .
forced labour for the university , she had less and less time .
and because her aunt ’ s restaurant was not running well , she had no money for her tuition fees either .
as a result , christina had to stop her studies .
with this , she automatically lost her residence permit and was forced into staying illegally in the united states .
she was now completely dependent on her aunt : “ i would get up around 6 , sometimes 7 , if i was very tired .
i 'd spend an hour on the road just to get to the restaurant , just to make sure that everything was ok before we opened and then go back in the kitchen and then start cooking and cleaning without a break .
i mean i would stop to eat but that ’ s pretty much all i had . ”
verbal and physical abuse the other employees at the restaurant were given a proper wage .
but christina didn ’ t even get a cent .
instead , she was assaulted verbally and at times physically .
amid fear of deportation , she did not know whom she could turn to for help .
she might have continued to work for her aunt , until one night , when her drunken uncle became too intrusive .
in panic and fear christina grabbed her belongings and left the house .
help from an organisation she was fortunate .
her immediate neighbour helped her and brought her into contact with the relief organization , " break the chain campaign " , where she got legal advice and help .
qimmah najeeullah , the director of the organization , explains : “ i think we all underestimate the power of the psychological version .
often times the trafficker or the employers explain the world to be really different than what it really is .
they will say : you see all the violence in the news .
oh !
that could be you . and it is natural for you to want to be in an environment that is safe .
and if you know it is an abuse and it is a limitation , it is still more comfortable than what you don ’ t know . ”
as a victim of trafficking christina was actually entitled to a so-called t-visa which could have legalised her stay in the u.s. but she refused to take it , as this could have meant that she stood as a witness against her aunt .
she is now married to a us citizen and is a green card holder .
she is also looking forward to her return to university .

on farms and in irrigation systems technical reforms are needed which will increase productivity - meaning that farmers will benefit , not only by growing more , they 'll also get more profit . ”
charters urges that asian governments must help the farmers implement these reforms : “ one of the things they can do is to encourage capacity building in farmers , teaching them new techniques , helping them through investments and availability of micro-finance in higher-tech types of irrigation technology such as drippers and sometimes sprinklers .
all these things use less water and increase productivity . ”
besides , charters thinks harvesting rain water and making it available for irrigation will be a good idea for developing countries to adopt so as to save precious ground water .
experts warn that water shortages in asia will probably be further aggravated by climate change , which is likely to make rainfall more irregular .

india 's sanitation pioneer bindeshwar pathak is this year 's winner of the prestigious stockholm water prize for his simple toilet system which is used in india and other countries .
during the conference , experts highlighted asia 's need to improve irrigation to feed its growing population . asia must improve its irrigation and farming processes to ward off food scarcity and social disorder , a joint study by the international water management institute and the un food and agriculture organisation fao says .
colin charters , the director general of the international water management institute explains : “ the critical issue is that if we get more frequent food crises , these food crises mean that people 's livelihoods are affected on farms , people 's nourishment is affected .
these things can lead to social unrest within countries .
that social unrest can be capitalised on by disruptive elements .
and where we see this kind of hardship , we tend to see people wanting to migrate out of the region . ”
meeting food needs the best way to avoid this scenario is of course to make sure people are well fed and happy in their own country .
the report describes three options for meeting the food needs of asia .
the first is to import huge quantities of cereals from other regions - but the report foretells that this is politically too risky .
the second option would be to improve and expand rain-fed agriculture - largely impractical , as suitable land is already in use in many areas .
the only remaining solution therefore is to focus on irrigated farmlands .
the report says that for this , the irrigation systems in asia need to be revitalised .

soothsayers of the business also tried to predict the future of gaming technology . cologne is hosting the games developers conference , an industry-insider conference which ended on wednesday , and gamescom , a massive public celebration of electronic entertainment , through sunday .
one of germany 's biggest game developers , frankfurt-based crytek was there hawking its new cryengine3 software development toolset .
crytek is best known for its non-linear game-play and graphically intense action games such as " farcry " and " crysis . "
even as console gaming platforms like the xbox 360 and playstation3 have proven themselves software-selling juggernauts , the gaming industry will have to stop focusing purely on graphics to be successful , according to crytek founder cevat yerli .
building a better game video gaming graphics advances are effectively stalled for the next three years , yerli said , as maximum screen resolution is tied to the gaming console development cycle .
that means developers will have to find other ways to grab gamers ' interest .
until 2012 , crytek will rely on improving artificial intelligence , physics and special effects in order to differentiate itself from other games developers , he said .
" the online gaming market is growing fast , " said patrick lehrmann , a project manager for games academy , a school for game developers .
" and this market is not about graphics .
it 's going to be absolutely about game design . " "
instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 . " this will be a first person shooter , somewhat akin to the games that crytek has made such a name for itself in producing . but ccp is taking this model a step further . dust 514 will be a console multiplayer game , which will take place within the well-established universe of eve online . " we 're creating an fps with consequences and benefits for gamers ' actions , " richardsson said .
first person shooters tend to boast impressive graphics , and from the video ccp showed at the game 's announcement , dust will be no exception , but behind the surface of the game they plan to implement further layers of robust design .
the battles won or lost in dust will impact the eve universe and vice versa , and ccp hopes that cooperative alliances will emerge between players in the two linked games . good looks are hard to believe while games developers will always strive to look good , there are some who are re-thinking the often superficial approach to game development , such as crytek 's yerli .
" it 's better to create a believable world than a realistic world , " yerli said in an interview with deutsche welle , saying that it 's best to back away from attempting photo-realism and to create worlds that capture gamers ' attention .
most people ca n't tell the difference between the graphics in a game from seven years ago and a game from last year , lehrmann said , but they know when a game they play is well designed .
" they can recognize how beautiful the work is that went into it , " he said .

instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 . " this will be a first person shooter , somewhat akin to the games that crytek has made such a name for itself in producing . but ccp is taking this model a step further . dust 514 will be a console multiplayer game , which will take place within the well-established universe of eve online . " we 're creating an fps with consequences and benefits for gamers ' actions , " richardsson said .
first person shooters tend to boast impressive graphics , and from the video ccp showed at the game 's announcement , dust will be no exception , but behind the surface of the game they plan to implement further layers of robust design .
the battles won or lost in dust will impact the eve universe and vice versa , and ccp hopes that cooperative alliances will emerge between players in the two linked games . good looks are hard to believe while games developers will always strive to look good , there are some who are re-thinking the often superficial approach to game development , such as crytek 's yerli .
" it 's better to create a believable world than a realistic world , " yerli said in an interview with deutsche welle , saying that it 's best to back away from attempting photo-realism and to create worlds that capture gamers ' attention .
most people ca n't tell the difference between the graphics in a game from seven years ago and a game from last year , lehrmann said , but they know when a game they play is well designed .
" they can recognize how beautiful the work is that went into it , " he said .

the assassination of siegfried buback , a strong opponent of the left-wing extremist terrorist group , marked the beginning of a wave of terrorist acts by the raf in their radical opposition to the west german government .
it remained one of the highest-profile political killings carried out by the raf throughout the militant group 's campaign .
buback , his driver wolfgang goebel , and georg wurster , a court officer , were all shot dead on the way to the court house in karlsruhe .
a motorcycle pulled up to buback 's mercedes when it stopped at a traffic light , and a passenger on the back opened fire with an automatic weapon .
eyewitnesses claimed the shooter had a slight build , suggesting a female assailant .
investigators , however , focused on raf member stefan wisniewski , who ex-terrorist peter-juergen boock had implicated as the possible shooter .
the federal prosecutor 's office said thursday that while the discovery of becker 's dna on the envelopes meant that she could not be ruled out as the assassin , it was not conclusive evidence in itself .
further investigations would follow .
new twist in on-going investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verena becker in an undated police the new revelations come only a year after dna testing on a motorcycle glove , helmet and jacket found after buback 's death had ruled out any connection to becker , who was released from jail some 20 years ago after serving several years for raf-related crimes .
former raf members christian klar , knut folkerts , guenter sonnenberg and brigitte mohnhaupt were convicted collectively of the buback murder , but authorities remain unsure of who fired the deadly shots .
michael buback , the son of the murdered prosecutor , had repeatedly named verena becker as a possible suspect .
" i am relieved that the efforts to clarify the details of the karlsruhe assassination have been resumed , " michael buback told reporters. nda / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that leaves germany as a lone voice against the " monopolization " and " americanization " of european culture . paris ' bibliotheque nationale de france -lrb- bnf -rrb- said thursday that it is in talks with google over the possibility of allowing the california-based internet giant to scan a portion of its 30 million books and documents , making them available free of charge on the internet . thirty libraries , including renowned university institutions at harvard , princeton and oxford , are already involved in the project , which aims to digitalize both out-of-print books as well as publications that are currently on the market . germany rejects google plan if the influential bnf reaches an agreement with google , it would mean a significant blow to the german government 's adamant stance against the book search project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has said it intends to scan only excerpts of books currently on the market " i have protested against google and will continue to do so , as long as copyrighted works are scanned without the prior approval of the author , " bernd neumann , germany 's minister of culture , said thursday . in the us , google has reached a legal agreement with publishing houses , according to which they receive a lump sum for the books offered up for scanning .
the authors themselves are not consulted . also on thursday , the german publishers and booksellers association issued a statement welcoming the digitalization of copyright-free material .
however , it criticized the european commission and the major participating eu states for supporting the google project . " states are being negligent with their cultural heritage when they turn it over to a monopolist and thereby run tax-funded projects like the european digital library europeana into the ground , " said alexander skipis , the association 's director . brussels gives its blessing launched in november 2008 , the europeana digital library offers users access to some two million digital objects including film material , photos , maps , books , newspapers and other documents . eu commissioner for information , society and media , vivane reding , told german daily handelsblatt that 90 percent of all archived books worldwide were no longer in print and therefore not accessible to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bavarian state library is the only one in germany to make a deal with google " it 's good that new business models are developed to bring this content to the consumers , " said reding , adding that digitalization was an expensive undertaking that could n't be borne by governments alone . french library reconsiders the bnf has a digitalization project of its own , with 100,000 books and rare documents being scanned each year over a course of three years .
these are available on the french web site gallica . in 2005 , bnf 's director at the time , jean-noel jeanneney , was adamantly opposed to the budding google project , which he viewed as the americanization of european culture . though the german government is unyielding in its opposition to the mass digitalization endeavor , one library in germany - the bavarian state library in munich - has signed a contract with google . france 's change of heart on the matter is another thorn in the side of germany 's ministry of culture . kjb / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .

" he is mentally strong and i am convinced that after returning from italy he will be training hard and working on his comeback .
i think we 'll still have a lot of fun with him in munich , " he said .

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .
" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .

the system works by reflecting the light from 2,153 mirrors to a 22-square-meter -lrb- 239-square-foot -rrb- ceramic receptor atop a 60-meter tower .
the steam produced as gas in the receptor heats up to over 700 degrees celsius -lrb- 1,292 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and powers a turbine that is used to generate power .

" the solar thermal power station in juelich is showing how it 's done . " despite receiving some 10.6 million euros of funding from the federal and two state governments , the array 's potential will likely not be realized in germany , but in sunnier regions closer to the equator , thoben said . german environment minister sigmar gabriel added that the new solar project would help solidify germany 's expertise in the renewable energy market . " we are creating the technical requirements for solar power to be delivered from the desert , " he said .
" thanks to these kinds of technical investments we are prepared to be a leader in a driving market of the future .

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .

" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .

ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .

access is granted via application . wwii restitution an issue art theft is a worldwide problem ; in germany , stories of art theft often center around art that was looted from its owners amid the oppression and chaos of world war ii . during that time , " a relocation of cultural items took place whose full scope has still not been completely explored and investigated , " according to the coordination office for lost cultural assets , located in magdeburg . the nazis , the soviet trophy commissions , and individual allied military personnel all perpetrated art theft .
artworks and artifacts were also removed or relocated to protect them during wartime and are now located on foreign territory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a public database , art buyers ca n't claim ignorance in june , 46 countries signed the terezin declaration , vowing to increase their efforts to return more of the estimated 650,000 works of art stolen from european jews during the holocaust . the new interpol database could be of help in the search for these and other objects stolen in any of the agency 's 187 member countries . the information in the database will consist of descriptions and photographs of stolen cultural goods , according to karl hein kind , who coordinates the works of art department of interpol based in lyon , france . ' a barrier for traffickers ' contribution and access to the database represents " an important tool to counter the traffic in cultural property effectively , " kind said . all of interpol 's member countries will contribute information , he added . the agency hopes that by opening up access to the database to the public and to concerned cultural and professional bodies such as ministries of culture , museums , auction houses , art galleries , foundations , and collectors , it will be that much more difficult for a seller or purchaser to claim not having had the opportunity to check whether an item was recorded as stolen . " extensive online access to the database -lrb- … -rrb- represents an important barrier to the illicit trafficking of a stolen cultural object by making its sale more difficult , " kind said . victorine stille works for the art loss register , an international company that also keeps an online database of stolen art .
their company also keeps a database of stolen goods , and takes a fee for checking on the provenance of artworks - for buyers who want to be sure about their art investments , for example . she agrees on the importance of transparency when it comes to stolen art , and welcomes the presence of another international art register . " the art loss register has always worked very closely with interpol and other police agencies , " stille said . " both of our aims is to solve art crimes ... interpol is helping to create public awareness of the problem .

dw 's sabina matthay examines how free and fair the elections actually were . almost defiantly , the afghan foreign ministry declared that election day was a success .
indeed , there are some who say the events could pass as a trial run for democracy , as a step toward real democratic change , peace and prosperity .
on the surface it may have been a day to remember : in many provinces and towns voters lined up to elect a new president , defying the taliban and others who are so intent on destabilizing the country .
a wonderful image that was pounced on by the government , which had even attempted to impose a blackout on media coverage of violence and intimidation .
however , it was a different story in many other areas , the city of kunduz in particular was targeted relentlessly by taliban rocket attacks and at least five people were hurt there on election day .
then there are the figures : 200,000 afghan and 100,000 international security forces were dispatched to protect the polling stations - hardly the sign of a normal election day , and if those numbers ultimately fail to provide adequate security , the situation becomes even more farcical .
the violence has also overshadowed another danger overshadowing these polls , namely fraud and vote rigging .
many polling stations were forced to stay shut , not only those in the taliban-dominated south .
others may have opened , however election observers were not granted access - thus it 's almost impossible to know what happened at those polling stations .

it has been widely reported that incumbent - and unpopular - leader hamid karzai has absolutely no interest in being forced into a run-off poll , which could see him defeated .
as always these allegations are based on rumors and counter-rumors , however the very fact that the electoral commission , tasked with guaranteeing a free and fair poll , sent out thousands of election documents to children ineligible to vote highlights the lack of transparency and fairness , and further undermines any confidence in the government .
should these allegations be confirmed , it could spell the beginning of the end for a democratically-rooted afghanistan .

then there are the figures : 200,000 afghan and 100,000 international security forces were dispatched to protect the polling stations - hardly the sign of a normal election day , and if those numbers ultimately fail to provide adequate security , the situation becomes even more farcical .
the violence has also overshadowed another danger overshadowing these polls , namely fraud and vote rigging .
many polling stations were forced to stay shut , not only those in the taliban-dominated south .
others may have opened , however election observers were not granted access - thus it 's almost impossible to know what happened at those polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been wide-spread allegations of vote rigging there was evidence of fraud at the last presidential election in 2004 , this time observers say the vote rigging was systematic .
it has been widely reported that incumbent - and unpopular - leader hamid karzai has absolutely no interest in being forced into a run-off poll , which could see him defeated .
as always these allegations are based on rumors and counter-rumors , however the very fact that the electoral commission , tasked with guaranteeing a free and fair poll , sent out thousands of election documents to children ineligible to vote highlights the lack of transparency and fairness , and further undermines any confidence in the government .
should these allegations be confirmed , it could spell the beginning of the end for a democratically-rooted afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.08.2009 graphics will take a backseat to game design , story großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the games developers conference and gamescom gave players a chance to see upcoming titles the electronic entertainment industry 's heavyweights showed off their shiniest toys at the games developers conference in cologne .
soothsayers of the business also tried to predict the future of gaming technology . cologne is hosting the games developers conference , an industry-insider conference which ended on wednesday , and gamescom , a massive public celebration of electronic entertainment , through sunday .
one of germany 's biggest game developers , frankfurt-based crytek was there hawking its new cryengine3 software development toolset .
crytek is best known for its non-linear game-play and graphically intense action games such as " farcry " and " crysis . "
even as console gaming platforms like the xbox 360 and playstation3 have proven themselves software-selling juggernauts , the gaming industry will have to stop focusing purely on graphics to be successful , according to crytek founder cevat yerli .
building a better game video gaming graphics advances are effectively stalled for the next three years , yerli said , as maximum screen resolution is tied to the gaming console development cycle .
that means developers will have to find other ways to grab gamers ' interest .
until 2012 , crytek will rely on improving artificial intelligence , physics and special effects in order to differentiate itself from other games developers , he said .
" the online gaming market is growing fast , " said patrick lehrmann , a project manager for games academy , a school for game developers .
" and this market is not about graphics .
it 's going to be absolutely about game design . " "
instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 . " this will be a first person shooter , somewhat akin to the games that crytek has made such a name for itself in producing . but ccp is taking this model a step further . dust 514 will be a console multiplayer game , which will take place within the well-established universe of eve online . " we 're creating an fps with consequences and benefits for gamers ' actions , " richardsson said .
first person shooters tend to boast impressive graphics , and from the video ccp showed at the game 's announcement , dust will be no exception , but behind the surface of the game they plan to implement further layers of robust design .
the battles won or lost in dust will impact the eve universe and vice versa , and ccp hopes that cooperative alliances will emerge between players in the two linked games . good looks are hard to believe while games developers will always strive to look good , there are some who are re-thinking the often superficial approach to game development , such as crytek 's yerli .
" it 's better to create a believable world than a realistic world , " yerli said in an interview with deutsche welle , saying that it 's best to back away from attempting photo-realism and to create worlds that capture gamers ' attention .
most people ca n't tell the difference between the graphics in a game from seven years ago and a game from last year , lehrmann said , but they know when a game they play is well designed .
" they can recognize how beautiful the work is that went into it , " he said .

access is granted via application . wwii restitution an issue art theft is a worldwide problem ; in germany , stories of art theft often center around art that was looted from its owners amid the oppression and chaos of world war ii . during that time , " a relocation of cultural items took place whose full scope has still not been completely explored and investigated , " according to the coordination office for lost cultural assets , located in magdeburg . the nazis , the soviet trophy commissions , and individual allied military personnel all perpetrated art theft .
artworks and artifacts were also removed or relocated to protect them during wartime and are now located on foreign territory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a public database , art buyers ca n't claim ignorance in june , 46 countries signed the terezin declaration , vowing to increase their efforts to return more of the estimated 650,000 works of art stolen from european jews during the holocaust . the new interpol database could be of help in the search for these and other objects stolen in any of the agency 's 187 member countries . the information in the database will consist of descriptions and photographs of stolen cultural goods , according to karl hein kind , who coordinates the works of art department of interpol based in lyon , france . ' a barrier for traffickers ' contribution and access to the database represents " an important tool to counter the traffic in cultural property effectively , " kind said . all of interpol 's member countries will contribute information , he added . the agency hopes that by opening up access to the database to the public and to concerned cultural and professional bodies such as ministries of culture , museums , auction houses , art galleries , foundations , and collectors , it will be that much more difficult for a seller or purchaser to claim not having had the opportunity to check whether an item was recorded as stolen . " extensive online access to the database -lrb- … -rrb- represents an important barrier to the illicit trafficking of a stolen cultural object by making its sale more difficult , " kind said . victorine stille works for the art loss register , an international company that also keeps an online database of stolen art .
their company also keeps a database of stolen goods , and takes a fee for checking on the provenance of artworks - for buyers who want to be sure about their art investments , for example . she agrees on the importance of transparency when it comes to stolen art , and welcomes the presence of another international art register . " the art loss register has always worked very closely with interpol and other police agencies , " stille said . " both of our aims is to solve art crimes ... interpol is helping to create public awareness of the problem .
its good that they 've made the database available to everyone because now people ca n't hide anymore by saying ' oh , we did n't know .

“ i knew that i was going to do well in the school , ” she says .

access is granted via application . wwii restitution an issue art theft is a worldwide problem ; in germany , stories of art theft often center around art that was looted from its owners amid the oppression and chaos of world war ii . during that time , " a relocation of cultural items took place whose full scope has still not been completely explored and investigated , " according to the coordination office for lost cultural assets , located in magdeburg . the nazis , the soviet trophy commissions , and individual allied military personnel all perpetrated art theft .
artworks and artifacts were also removed or relocated to protect them during wartime and are now located on foreign territory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a public database , art buyers ca n't claim ignorance in june , 46 countries signed the terezin declaration , vowing to increase their efforts to return more of the estimated 650,000 works of art stolen from european jews during the holocaust . the new interpol database could be of help in the search for these and other objects stolen in any of the agency 's 187 member countries . the information in the database will consist of descriptions and photographs of stolen cultural goods , according to karl hein kind , who coordinates the works of art department of interpol based in lyon , france . ' a barrier for traffickers ' contribution and access to the database represents " an important tool to counter the traffic in cultural property effectively , " kind said . all of interpol 's member countries will contribute information , he added . the agency hopes that by opening up access to the database to the public and to concerned cultural and professional bodies such as ministries of culture , museums , auction houses , art galleries , foundations , and collectors , it will be that much more difficult for a seller or purchaser to claim not having had the opportunity to check whether an item was recorded as stolen . " extensive online access to the database -lrb- … -rrb- represents an important barrier to the illicit trafficking of a stolen cultural object by making its sale more difficult , " kind said . victorine stille works for the art loss register , an international company that also keeps an online database of stolen art .
their company also keeps a database of stolen goods , and takes a fee for checking on the provenance of artworks - for buyers who want to be sure about their art investments , for example . she agrees on the importance of transparency when it comes to stolen art , and welcomes the presence of another international art register . " the art loss register has always worked very closely with interpol and other police agencies , " stille said . " both of our aims is to solve art crimes ... interpol is helping to create public awareness of the problem .
its good that they 've made the database available to everyone because now people ca n't hide anymore by saying ' oh , we did n't know .

india 's sanitation pioneer bindeshwar pathak is this year 's winner of the prestigious stockholm water prize for his simple toilet system which is used in india and other countries .
during the conference , experts highlighted asia 's need to improve irrigation to feed its growing population . asia must improve its irrigation and farming processes to ward off food scarcity and social disorder , a joint study by the international water management institute and the un food and agriculture organisation fao says .
colin charters , the director general of the international water management institute explains : “ the critical issue is that if we get more frequent food crises , these food crises mean that people 's livelihoods are affected on farms , people 's nourishment is affected .
these things can lead to social unrest within countries .
that social unrest can be capitalised on by disruptive elements .
and where we see this kind of hardship , we tend to see people wanting to migrate out of the region . ”
meeting food needs the best way to avoid this scenario is of course to make sure people are well fed and happy in their own country .
the report describes three options for meeting the food needs of asia .
the first is to import huge quantities of cereals from other regions - but the report foretells that this is politically too risky .
the second option would be to improve and expand rain-fed agriculture - largely impractical , as suitable land is already in use in many areas .
the only remaining solution therefore is to focus on irrigated farmlands .
the report says that for this , the irrigation systems in asia need to be revitalised .
water reforms charters calls for major water reforms to increase food supply in asia .
“ the steps needed are : one , recognition of the problem by the powers-that-be like the politicians ; two , reform of the institutions that manage water and the way water is governed particularly making sure that people ’ s rights to water are recognised in law and legislation , making sure that those rights protect the water for the farmers .
on farms and in irrigation systems technical reforms are needed which will increase productivity - meaning that farmers will benefit , not only by growing more , they 'll also get more profit . ”
charters urges that asian governments must help the farmers implement these reforms : “ one of the things they can do is to encourage capacity building in farmers , teaching them new techniques , helping them through investments and availability of micro-finance in higher-tech types of irrigation technology such as drippers and sometimes sprinklers .
all these things use less water and increase productivity . ”
besides , charters thinks harvesting rain water and making it available for irrigation will be a good idea for developing countries to adopt so as to save precious ground water .
experts warn that water shortages in asia will probably be further aggravated by climate change , which is likely to make rainfall more irregular .

colin charters , the director general of the international water management institute explains : “ the critical issue is that if we get more frequent food crises , these food crises mean that people 's livelihoods are affected on farms , people 's nourishment is affected .
these things can lead to social unrest within countries .
that social unrest can be capitalised on by disruptive elements .
and where we see this kind of hardship , we tend to see people wanting to migrate out of the region . ”
meeting food needs the best way to avoid this scenario is of course to make sure people are well fed and happy in their own country .
the report describes three options for meeting the food needs of asia .
the first is to import huge quantities of cereals from other regions - but the report foretells that this is politically too risky .
the second option would be to improve and expand rain-fed agriculture - largely impractical , as suitable land is already in use in many areas .
the only remaining solution therefore is to focus on irrigated farmlands .
the report says that for this , the irrigation systems in asia need to be revitalised .
water reforms charters calls for major water reforms to increase food supply in asia .
“ the steps needed are : one , recognition of the problem by the powers-that-be like the politicians ; two , reform of the institutions that manage water and the way water is governed particularly making sure that people ’ s rights to water are recognised in law and legislation , making sure that those rights protect the water for the farmers .
on farms and in irrigation systems technical reforms are needed which will increase productivity - meaning that farmers will benefit , not only by growing more , they 'll also get more profit . ”
charters urges that asian governments must help the farmers implement these reforms : “ one of the things they can do is to encourage capacity building in farmers , teaching them new techniques , helping them through investments and availability of micro-finance in higher-tech types of irrigation technology such as drippers and sometimes sprinklers .
all these things use less water and increase productivity . ”
besides , charters thinks harvesting rain water and making it available for irrigation will be a good idea for developing countries to adopt so as to save precious ground water .
experts warn that water shortages in asia will probably be further aggravated by climate change , which is likely to make rainfall more irregular .

despite measures to abolish slavery worldwide , human trafficking and forced labour remain very evident across the globe .
poor people , who come to foreign countries in search of a better life , are the most vulnerable .
christina from myanmar is one of the many who have been subjected to human rights violations . in the fall of 2003 , christina came to the us with new dreams in her eyes .
in her country myanmar , she saw little hope .
as a member of the indian minority community and as a christian in a predominantly buddhist country , she often felt like an outsider .
her success at school was the only respite to compensate for the discrimination she was experiencing almost everyday .
then she got admission into an american university .
a future full of hopes for her .
“ i knew that i was going to do well in the school , ” she says .
“ i was 19 and i had plans to finish school in four years , go on peace corps , help out people , and come back , do my graduate school .
so i had my life planned out already ahead of time . ”
turn of events but her life changed soon .
from a confident student , she became a victim of economic exploitation .
she had to work at her aunt ’ s restaurant in the us .
“ for about a month , life was good .
and then it started changing gradually , " says christina .
“ i was pressured into doing a lot of things that i didn ’ t want to do .
first of all , i worked for her business , so i was i already spending time outside the house with her , for her and then i would come home and put up with the family , having to take care of all the chores and things around .
it was like 24/7 .
i was a slave . ”
christina did not resist .
her cultural background demanded an unconditional obedience to elders .
forced labour for the university , she had less and less time .
and because her aunt ’ s restaurant was not running well , she had no money for her tuition fees either .
as a result , christina had to stop her studies .
with this , she automatically lost her residence permit and was forced into staying illegally in the united states .
she was now completely dependent on her aunt : “ i would get up around 6 , sometimes 7 , if i was very tired .
i 'd spend an hour on the road just to get to the restaurant , just to make sure that everything was ok before we opened and then go back in the kitchen and then start cooking and cleaning without a break .
i mean i would stop to eat but that ’ s pretty much all i had . ”
verbal and physical abuse the other employees at the restaurant were given a proper wage .
but christina didn ’ t even get a cent .
instead , she was assaulted verbally and at times physically .
amid fear of deportation , she did not know whom she could turn to for help .
she might have continued to work for her aunt , until one night , when her drunken uncle became too intrusive .
in panic and fear christina grabbed her belongings and left the house .
help from an organisation she was fortunate .
her immediate neighbour helped her and brought her into contact with the relief organization , " break the chain campaign " , where she got legal advice and help .
qimmah najeeullah , the director of the organization , explains : “ i think we all underestimate the power of the psychological version .
often times the trafficker or the employers explain the world to be really different than what it really is .
they will say : you see all the violence in the news .
oh !
that could be you . and it is natural for you to want to be in an environment that is safe .
and if you know it is an abuse and it is a limitation , it is still more comfortable than what you don ’ t know . ”
as a victim of trafficking christina was actually entitled to a so-called t-visa which could have legalised her stay in the u.s. but she refused to take it , as this could have meant that she stood as a witness against her aunt .
she is now married to a us citizen and is a green card holder .
she is also looking forward to her return to university .

elections in afghanistan were relatively peaceful , despite taliban threats to disrupt the vote .
there were reports of sporadic violence throughout the country , with over 20 deaths on thursday .
still , the attacks were less serious than many experts had feared .
the taliban had also discouraged people from going to the polls in a bid to lower turnout and tarnish the vote 's legitimacy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.08.2009 graphics will take a backseat to game design , story großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the games developers conference and gamescom gave players a chance to see upcoming titles the electronic entertainment industry 's heavyweights showed off their shiniest toys at the games developers conference in cologne .
soothsayers of the business also tried to predict the future of gaming technology . cologne is hosting the games developers conference , an industry-insider conference which ended on wednesday , and gamescom , a massive public celebration of electronic entertainment , through sunday .
one of germany 's biggest game developers , frankfurt-based crytek was there hawking its new cryengine3 software development toolset .
crytek is best known for its non-linear game-play and graphically intense action games such as " farcry " and " crysis . "
even as console gaming platforms like the xbox 360 and playstation3 have proven themselves software-selling juggernauts , the gaming industry will have to stop focusing purely on graphics to be successful , according to crytek founder cevat yerli .
building a better game video gaming graphics advances are effectively stalled for the next three years , yerli said , as maximum screen resolution is tied to the gaming console development cycle .
that means developers will have to find other ways to grab gamers ' interest .
until 2012 , crytek will rely on improving artificial intelligence , physics and special effects in order to differentiate itself from other games developers , he said .
" the online gaming market is growing fast , " said patrick lehrmann , a project manager for games academy , a school for game developers .
" and this market is not about graphics .
it 's going to be absolutely about game design . " "
instead , game design and game-play elements , which transcend the requirement for constantly advancing graphics , will become more important , said lehrmann , who worked for several years on the graphics side of game development before joining the berlin-based school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crysis seriously pushed the boundaries of graphics in video gaming " i think there will come a time , very soon , when it 's not about graphics anymore . " he said , adding that graphics wo n't get worse but simply wo n't advance at the same speed as in recent years .
graphics are just one part of the recipe that 's a development some european developers , including hilmar petursson , head of reykjavik-based ccp , are likely to welcome .
ccp makes most of its money with the massively multiplayer online game " eve online . " a very different game from any of crytek 's projects , eve online focuses less on graphics than the system needed to maintain a population of 300,000 people playing together on one server .
" we 're constantly reinvesting in technology , " ccp executive producer nathan richardsson said .
" and getting to a point where we have a strong architectural runway to really keep on innovating . "
to prove their dedication to pushing the technological envelope , ccp announced a new project at the games developers conference called " dust 514 . " this will be a first person shooter , somewhat akin to the games that crytek has made such a name for itself in producing . but ccp is taking this model a step further . dust 514 will be a console multiplayer game , which will take place within the well-established universe of eve online . " we 're creating an fps with consequences and benefits for gamers ' actions , " richardsson said .
first person shooters tend to boast impressive graphics , and from the video ccp showed at the game 's announcement , dust will be no exception , but behind the surface of the game they plan to implement further layers of robust design .
the battles won or lost in dust will impact the eve universe and vice versa , and ccp hopes that cooperative alliances will emerge between players in the two linked games . good looks are hard to believe while games developers will always strive to look good , there are some who are re-thinking the often superficial approach to game development , such as crytek 's yerli .
" it 's better to create a believable world than a realistic world , " yerli said in an interview with deutsche welle , saying that it 's best to back away from attempting photo-realism and to create worlds that capture gamers ' attention .
most people ca n't tell the difference between the graphics in a game from seven years ago and a game from last year , lehrmann said , but they know when a game they play is well designed .
" they can recognize how beautiful the work is that went into it , " he said .

that leaves germany as a lone voice against the " monopolization " and " americanization " of european culture . paris ' bibliotheque nationale de france -lrb- bnf -rrb- said thursday that it is in talks with google over the possibility of allowing the california-based internet giant to scan a portion of its 30 million books and documents , making them available free of charge on the internet . thirty libraries , including renowned university institutions at harvard , princeton and oxford , are already involved in the project , which aims to digitalize both out-of-print books as well as publications that are currently on the market . germany rejects google plan if the influential bnf reaches an agreement with google , it would mean a significant blow to the german government 's adamant stance against the book search project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has said it intends to scan only excerpts of books currently on the market " i have protested against google and will continue to do so , as long as copyrighted works are scanned without the prior approval of the author , " bernd neumann , germany 's minister of culture , said thursday . in the us , google has reached a legal agreement with publishing houses , according to which they receive a lump sum for the books offered up for scanning .
the authors themselves are not consulted . also on thursday , the german publishers and booksellers association issued a statement welcoming the digitalization of copyright-free material .
however , it criticized the european commission and the major participating eu states for supporting the google project . " states are being negligent with their cultural heritage when they turn it over to a monopolist and thereby run tax-funded projects like the european digital library europeana into the ground , " said alexander skipis , the association 's director . brussels gives its blessing launched in november 2008 , the europeana digital library offers users access to some two million digital objects including film material , photos , maps , books , newspapers and other documents . eu commissioner for information , society and media , vivane reding , told german daily handelsblatt that 90 percent of all archived books worldwide were no longer in print and therefore not accessible to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bavarian state library is the only one in germany to make a deal with google " it 's good that new business models are developed to bring this content to the consumers , " said reding , adding that digitalization was an expensive undertaking that could n't be borne by governments alone . french library reconsiders the bnf has a digitalization project of its own , with 100,000 books and rare documents being scanned each year over a course of three years .
these are available on the french web site gallica . in 2005 , bnf 's director at the time , jean-noel jeanneney , was adamantly opposed to the budding google project , which he viewed as the americanization of european culture . though the german government is unyielding in its opposition to the mass digitalization endeavor , one library in germany - the bavarian state library in munich - has signed a contract with google . france 's change of heart on the matter is another thorn in the side of germany 's ministry of culture . kjb / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mostly slow game was watched by 30,150 spectators .
both defenses were only tested occasionally and despite threats by sejad salihovic and vebad ibisevic for hoffenheim , schalke goalkeeper manuel neuer managed to keep the hosts out .
" we did n't have any clear goal chances and we have to to be satisfied with the point here , " said neuer , as his team provisionally rose to the top of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg have started where they left off last season by securing two impressive victories over cologne and vfb stuttgart .
but fellow northerners hamburg have also started solidly under new coach bruno labbadia and will relish the chance of leapfrogging wolfsburg on sunday - and gaining revenge for two painful defeats to the wolves last season .
" they really took us down a peg last season , " said hamburg captain david jarolim , recalling a 3-0 defeat in wolfsburg and a 3-1 loss at home in march when hamburg had briefly topped the league .
" i do n't want to talk about revenge as we only had ourselves to blame for the two defeats , but we want to make up for it . "
hamburg , who defeated borussia dortmund last weekend , will be hoping thursday 's europa league trip to french side ea guingamp will not prove overly taxing .
meanwhile wolfsburg coach armin veh will probably see no reason to change his strike duo of edin dzeko and the brazilian grafite - who scored 54 goals between them last season - despite a good start by 10-million-euro -lrb- $ 14.2 million -rrb- signing obafemi martins .
the nigerian missed training on wednesday with a cold , but is expected to recover by sunday , probably to take a place on the bench .
bayern looking for first win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is frustrated by his team 's sluggish start bayern munich , meanwhile , will be looking for a first victory after two draws under dutch coach louis van gaal when they travel to promoted mainz on saturday .
van gaal will be without the injured martin demichelis in defense and captain mark van bommel in midfield , but is hoping french international franck ribery will be available .
ribery has been suffering from a groin strain which has restricted his training but van gaal is anxious to see how he fits into a new central role behind the strikers .
italy striker luca toni has returned from italy to begin training following an achilles tendon injury but is not fit enough to challenge mario gomez and either miroslav klose or ivica olic .
the arrival of gomez and olic seems to have relegated toni to the bench but chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has warned against writing off the 32-year-old .
" he is mentally strong and i am convinced that after returning from italy he will be training hard and working on his comeback .
i think we 'll still have a lot of fun with him in munich , " he said .
basement battlers looking for first points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince poldi 's return to cologne has not been a happy one at the other end of the table the arrival of striker lukas podolski from bayern has not translated to points for cologne who are bottom following two defeats ahead of saturday 's visit by eintracht frankfurt .
cologne will feel it 's a must-win game as tough matches follow against hamburg , schalke , stuttgart , bayer leverkusen and bayern munich .
" we have to stay calm and not get hectic .
we have shown that we can match opponents like wolfsburg -lrb- a 3-1 home defeat -rrb- .
but the two first games have shown that it 's going to be a tough season , " podolski told kicker sports magazine .
hanover , who visit nuremberg on saturday , are also looking for a first win as well as a new coach after dieter hecking threw in the towel late wednesday .
werder bremen - boosted by the signing of last season 's on-loan striker claudio pizarro - are another side seeking a first win , with borussia moenchengladbach the visitors on sunday .
borussia dortmund and stuttgart - both fancied to do well this season - meet on saturday , while leverkusen are at promoted freiburg in the day 's other game .

dw 's sabina matthay examines how free and fair the elections actually were . almost defiantly , the afghan foreign ministry declared that election day was a success .
indeed , there are some who say the events could pass as a trial run for democracy , as a step toward real democratic change , peace and prosperity .
on the surface it may have been a day to remember : in many provinces and towns voters lined up to elect a new president , defying the taliban and others who are so intent on destabilizing the country .
a wonderful image that was pounced on by the government , which had even attempted to impose a blackout on media coverage of violence and intimidation .
however , it was a different story in many other areas , the city of kunduz in particular was targeted relentlessly by taliban rocket attacks and at least five people were hurt there on election day .
then there are the figures : 200,000 afghan and 100,000 international security forces were dispatched to protect the polling stations - hardly the sign of a normal election day , and if those numbers ultimately fail to provide adequate security , the situation becomes even more farcical .
the violence has also overshadowed another danger overshadowing these polls , namely fraud and vote rigging .
many polling stations were forced to stay shut , not only those in the taliban-dominated south .
others may have opened , however election observers were not granted access - thus it 's almost impossible to know what happened at those polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been wide-spread allegations of vote rigging there was evidence of fraud at the last presidential election in 2004 , this time observers say the vote rigging was systematic .
it has been widely reported that incumbent - and unpopular - leader hamid karzai has absolutely no interest in being forced into a run-off poll , which could see him defeated .
as always these allegations are based on rumors and counter-rumors , however the very fact that the electoral commission , tasked with guaranteeing a free and fair poll , sent out thousands of election documents to children ineligible to vote highlights the lack of transparency and fairness , and further undermines any confidence in the government .
should these allegations be confirmed , it could spell the beginning of the end for a democratically-rooted afghanistan .

now though , he 's upping sticks and heading to the us , but not before sending us a final postcard with memories of his time in spain .
madrid is a late night city , so it 's appropriate i 'm writing this final postcard at one o 'clock in the morning .
final , because after seven years in spain filing reports , i 'm leaving for good !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent danny wood is leaving spain and heading to the us on a much later morning in july 2002 , after arriving from london , the phone woke me up and i found myself in a live two-way , explaining a dramatic conflict over a tiny rock off the coast of morocco .
spain was retaking the quaintly named parsley island from moroccan soldiers and i managed to at least sound like i might know what i was talking about .
since then the big news stories have included , footballer david beckham 's arrival in 2003 , the train bomb attacks in 2004 by local islamic militants that killed nearly 200 people and now the economic crash that has sent spain from being europe 's top performing economy to a struggling one .
diverse reporting it is strange when one day you could be interviewing david beckham , the next day talking to a victim of a terrorist attack .
but those contrasts make freelance reporting very interesting , and spain has no shortage of contrasts .
on the one hand it 's europe 's top tourist destination with plenty of beaches , fiesta and fun , but it 's also the home of eta , the last active , european guerrilla movement that continues to murder with its bombs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car bombs have been a feature of eta 's campaign in the spanish capital there are also unusual feature stories to seek out – for example , europe 's largest colony of vultures just north of madrid who were starving under a law designed to stop mad cow disease .
or recurring favorites , like the controversy over how to deal with tens of thousands of unidentified bodies , still in mass graves all over the country , victims of the civil war and reprisals under the former dictator general francisco franco .
but during my seven spanish years , the most noticeable change – certainly here in madrid - has been the big rise in the number of immigrants .
when i arrived it was still unusual to see african people for example .
now , after experiencing europe 's most rapid rise in immigration , the city is as cosmopolitan as anywhere in europe .
political changes i also saw a conservative government establishing spain on the world stage by befriending us president george bush and helping his war on terror .
then under a socialist government , the opposite ; championing the cause of those who opposed the invasion of iraq .
both demonstrated spain 's growing confidence , in tune with its then growing economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain has witnessed dramatic changes in government over the last few years since then , the economic crash has been a big blow , perhaps more so , especially psychologically , than in other european countries .
with the millions of unemployed you get the impression that a certain confident spanish swagger has disappeared .
personal memories i 've already said goodbye to joaquin the waiter in my favorite restaurant , sanabresa , to carmen and jose at their fruit stall in the rundown old market on calle embajadores and to the chicken man , who 's name i never knew .
i expect i will have a farewell drink with my butcher mariano and his wife joanna .
they 've all kept me fed , entertained and featured in many reports as the voice of the people .
they exemplify one of those special things about spain - its friendly , inclusive atmosphere that you encounter in the local markets , in bars and restaurants .
it is true that the cafes and bars seem oblivious to the day of the week , lively with chatty , happy people , of all ages , including small children and grannies and grandpas .
so even though i 'm leaving , i 'll definitely come back to spain .
thanks for your attention and hasta luego .

more than 70 indigenous townships in australia 's northern territory have been taken over by federal authorities .
the move happened more than two years ago , amid reports of widespread abuse .
mr anaya travelled to the heart of australia to learn more about the unrelenting poverty that makes aborigines by far the country 's most disadvantaged people .
the united nation 's special rapporteur went to the central desert outpost of alice springs .
over a dinner of kangaroo 's tail , he heard how squalid living conditions were in many of the town camps that house aboriginal families .
' racist ' law mr anaya 's visit was requested by indigenous groups , church leaders and social justice organisations .
his task is to investigate the government 's radical intervention in dozens of troubled settlements in the northern territory .
two years ago troops , medical staff and social workers were deployed in an attempt to combat violence and the rampant abuse of children in aboriginal communities .
racial discrimination laws were suspended to allow the controversial policy to be implemented .
alcohol and pornography were banned and indigenous residents were forced to spend a portion of their welfare payments on essentials such as food .
some campaigners have argued the measures violate human rights because they only target aborigines .
mr anaya , an american professor of human rights law , plans to report on the major challenges faced by australia 's original inhabitants .
a recent study has found that the gap between non-indigenous australians and their aboriginal counterparts was growing in areas such as child abuse and domestic violence .
prime minister kevin rudd said it was " a devastating report " on an unacceptable situation .

more than 70 indigenous townships in australia 's northern territory have been taken over by federal authorities .
the move happened more than two years ago , amid reports of widespread abuse .
mr anaya travelled to the heart of australia to learn more about the unrelenting poverty that makes aborigines by far the country 's most disadvantaged people .
the united nation 's special rapporteur went to the central desert outpost of alice springs .
over a dinner of kangaroo 's tail , he heard how squalid living conditions were in many of the town camps that house aboriginal families .
' racist ' law mr anaya 's visit was requested by indigenous groups , church leaders and social justice organisations .
his task is to investigate the government 's radical intervention in dozens of troubled settlements in the northern territory .
two years ago troops , medical staff and social workers were deployed in an attempt to combat violence and the rampant abuse of children in aboriginal communities .
racial discrimination laws were suspended to allow the controversial policy to be implemented .
alcohol and pornography were banned and indigenous residents were forced to spend a portion of their welfare payments on essentials such as food .
some campaigners have argued the measures violate human rights because they only target aborigines .
mr anaya , an american professor of human rights law , plans to report on the major challenges faced by australia 's original inhabitants .
a recent study has found that the gap between non-indigenous australians and their aboriginal counterparts was growing in areas such as child abuse and domestic violence .
prime minister kevin rudd said it was " a devastating report " on an unacceptable situation .

the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- in wales said the vale of glamorgan council was " dragging its feet ... in the pursuit of profit " .
in may , a council committee recommended the local authority removed the five sunbeds it has at four leisure centres .
the council said it would make a decision next month .
the bma has also called on wrexham and flintshire councils to remove sunbeds from their leisure centres .
wrexham has been asked to comment .
head of leisure services at flintshire council , mike hornby , said sunbeds at three of its leisure centres would be reviewed in the near future .
' tanning salons ' the bma 's secretary in wales dr richard lewis said : " i am grateful that the dangers of using sunbeds have been recognised by the -lrb- vale of glamorgan council 's -rrb- scrutiny committee , but i can only put the delay in taking action down to the finance the sunbeds generate for the council .
" but , we believe that local authorities have a duty of care to the people they represent and a duty to promote public health . "
in june , assembly members called for evidence on whether more controls were needed on tanning salons in wales .
an inquiry is examining whether the industry needs tighter regulation following a number of high profile cases involving children being burned .
kelly thompson , 10 , from port talbot , had to be treated at a burns unit in swansea in april after spending 16 minutes on an unsupervised , coin-operated sunbed .
in another incident , a 14-year-old kirsty mcrae , from barry , suffered burns to 70 % of her body in february .
she spent 20 minutes under the lamps of a coin-operated sunbed while the salon was unstaffed .
in may , a vale of glamorgan council committee recommended the local authority removed the five sunbeds it has at four leisure centres .
councillors said the sunbeds were well-managed but they backed a report noting " well-documented concerns and dangers " about sunbed use .
but the bma said the council had met three times since then and had failed to consider the issue of take action .
' reckless failure ' it accused the council of a " reckless failure to uphold their duty of care to the local population " , and said the sunbeds were making a profit of around £ 15,000 a year for the local authority .
dr lewis added : " the vale is not the only council to have sunbeds in its leisure centres - wrexham and flintshire also do and we have called on them to take action too .
" local authorities should be leading on health protection , it 's absurd that sunbeds are even there . "
vale of glamorgan council 's head of economic development and leisure chris fray said : " the vale of glamorgan council 's cabinet will revisit the report at its meeting on 2 september where a decision will be made on whether to remove all sunbeds from its leisure centres .
" the cabinet needed to ensure that it had all the necessary details to make an informed decision . "
the council has two sunbeds at penarth leisure centre and one each at the barry , llantwit major and cowbridge centres .
