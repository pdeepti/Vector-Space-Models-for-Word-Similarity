government press officers also summoned a number of foreign journalists based in havana to complain that they had covered the event and allowed themselves to be " manipulated and used " by diplomats seeking publicity .
" the message was of criticism about the visit , meddling in cuban internal affairs and putting at risk the political dialog .
it was a pretty strong move , " a european diplomat was quoted as saying by news agency reuters .
" a question mark " on arrest on thursday , the diplomats from germany , sweden , hungary , poland and great britain visited the home of prominent cuban dissident and physician , darsi ferrer , to bring his his wife food , clothing and other donations .
ferer was arrested and jailed on july 21 .
he faces charges of illegal economic activity for buying two sacks of cement on the black market to repair his house . his wife told foreign media that the government was accusing him of alleged criminal acts to avoid having to admit that he is a political prisoner .
" there 's a question mark when it comes to this arrest , " swedish diplomat ingemar cederberg told reuters . " there are accusations that belong to the category of common crime , not really political , and -lrb- our visit -rrb- is a way of showing our interest that the case should advance and get clarified . "
eu concerns about human rights as a political activist , ferrer organizes a march in havana every year calling on the cuban government to respect human rights .
ferrer is an independent journalist and regularly publishes surveys and investigations about the social situation in cuba .
he is currently supporting a " people 's petition " to legalize the private ownership of property on the communist-ruled island .
last october , cuba and the eu began a diplomatic dialog and cautious process of easing tensions after a period of frosty relations following cuba 's mass incarceration of opposition leaders in 2003 .
despite improved relations with cuba , the european union remains concerned about the communist government 's treatment of political opponents .

mihai ghimpu is the first non-communist to hold the post since 2001 . members of the for european integration alliance unanimously elected mihai ghimpu to the post on friday .
the communists , the only party outside of the alliance with seats in parliament , had walked out of the session after the alliance refused to delay the election .
they have vowed to challenge the vote in court .
" this is proof of changes in the country that voters were waiting for , " gimpu told news agency dpa . " i am confident that -lrb- the ruling coalition -rrb- will move moldova dynamically on the path of integration into the family of european nations . "
the alliance also said friday that it had decided to nominate democratic party leader marian lupu , who defected from the communist party earlier in the year , for president .
they 'll have to sway at least eight communist deputies to get the 61 votes required to elect lupu as president . liberal democratic party head vlad filat was nominated for prime minister .
the coalition , which consists of the liberal democratic party , democratic party , liberal party and the our moldova party , won a majority in july elections , gaining 53 of the parliament 's 101 seats .
the communist party won the remaining 48 .
the government of moldova , europe 's poorest country , has been in disarray since april , when parliamentary elections resulted in a communist majority amid accusations of widespread vote fraud .
one person was killed and more than 300 injured in street clashes between police and protesters .
however , the communists could not get enough votes to elect a successor to outgoing president vladimir voronin .
that led to another round of parliamentary elections last month .
the communists and their party chief voronin , have controlled moldova for the past nine years .

the government could make you their client singing and dancing in the unemployment line ?
sounds like a scene from a 1930s musical .
but for actors and singers in germany , job centers are more than just a mandatory stop en route to a benefits check . the most common way for talented performers to get jobs in germany is tried and true : going to as many auditions as possible .
but germany 's government-run casting agency , the artists ' division of the german federal employment agency , gives potential stars a chance to land roles without having to wear out too much shoe leather . not everyone gets taken on by the artists ' division , which holds auditions on a regular basis .
applicants often come straight out of school , but long-time performers also come to strut their stuff in the hopes of getting on the agency 's roster . the agency represents artists of all stripes , from actors and singers to extras , cameramen , lighting specialists and models . holding auditions " throughout europe , only germany has a state-run agency for artists , and for such a broad spectrum , " said altera piccolo , one of the talent agents employed by the government . piccolo herself came out of the performing arts ; her background is in ballet and cultural management .
she is based in cologne , one of seven cities across germany whose employment office has an artists ' division .
the others are berlin , hamburg , hanover , leipzig , munich and stuttgart . it is up to piccolo and her co-workers to say whether the candidates are up to snuff , or if they need to keep working on their material and try again .
sometimes , applicants are simply told to go look for another career , but mostly the agents try and help guide people in their career path . piccolo 's co-worker berenike juergens studied directing and used to work in theater management .
she says she cares deeply about whether or not her clients " make it " in their chosen profession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress urspruch got a break through the agency " i get personally caught up in whether my candidates land a job at the theater or not - my heart is really in it for them , " berenike said . success stories soprano judith braun first tried out at the artists ' division ten years ago - and was promptly given some tips on how to improve .
six months later , she was taken on as a client . " i call here regularly , and i go to all the agencies in hamburg and berlin , and always ask if there are any openings , " she said . meanwhile , her efforts have paid off ; she is regularly engaged by the state theater of saarbrucken , among others . cultural institutions , too , are glad for the service they get with the artists ' division .
hans juergen moll is in charge of securing extras for the state theater in bonn .
he successfully used the employment office when he was trying to cast a particularly difficult role . hard row to hoe " we were looking for a dwarf actress , and found one through the artists ' division , " moll explained .
" she was a student and we were extremely happy , because she had an amazing presence .
later , i saw her on tv - it was christine urspruch , who plays in theaters across germany and now has a regular tv role on -lsb- well known german detective show -rsb- ' tatort . " ' acting is a famously difficult field .
as government budgets are trimmed , theater ensembles are cutting back on personnel .
on the other hand , there are new fields that are opening up for actors , such as reading audio books , the people at the employment office say . performers have a better chance of getting a job if they have solid and diverse training , a realistic assessment of their abilities , and good career advice , the employment officers say .

government press officers also summoned a number of foreign journalists based in havana to complain that they had covered the event and allowed themselves to be " manipulated and used " by diplomats seeking publicity .
" the message was of criticism about the visit , meddling in cuban internal affairs and putting at risk the political dialog .
it was a pretty strong move , " a european diplomat was quoted as saying by news agency reuters .

ferer was arrested and jailed on july 21 .
he faces charges of illegal economic activity for buying two sacks of cement on the black market to repair his house . his wife told foreign media that the government was accusing him of alleged criminal acts to avoid having to admit that he is a political prisoner .

ferrer is an independent journalist and regularly publishes surveys and investigations about the social situation in cuba .
he is currently supporting a " people 's petition " to legalize the private ownership of property on the communist-ruled island .

mihai ghimpu is the first non-communist to hold the post since 2001 . members of the for european integration alliance unanimously elected mihai ghimpu to the post on friday .
the communists , the only party outside of the alliance with seats in parliament , had walked out of the session after the alliance refused to delay the election .
they have vowed to challenge the vote in court .
" this is proof of changes in the country that voters were waiting for , " gimpu told news agency dpa . " i am confident that -lrb- the ruling coalition -rrb- will move moldova dynamically on the path of integration into the family of european nations . "
the alliance also said friday that it had decided to nominate democratic party leader marian lupu , who defected from the communist party earlier in the year , for president .
they 'll have to sway at least eight communist deputies to get the 61 votes required to elect lupu as president . liberal democratic party head vlad filat was nominated for prime minister .
the coalition , which consists of the liberal democratic party , democratic party , liberal party and the our moldova party , won a majority in july elections , gaining 53 of the parliament 's 101 seats .
the communist party won the remaining 48 .
the government of moldova , europe 's poorest country , has been in disarray since april , when parliamentary elections resulted in a communist majority amid accusations of widespread vote fraud .
one person was killed and more than 300 injured in street clashes between police and protesters .
however , the communists could not get enough votes to elect a successor to outgoing president vladimir voronin .
that led to another round of parliamentary elections last month .
the communists and their party chief voronin , have controlled moldova for the past nine years .
the party advocates stronger ties with russia , political distance from neighboring romania , and a policy of neutrality .
the ruling alliance favors closer ties with the european union and has named anti-corruption measures , a free and more open media , and pulling the country out of a steep recession as its leading priorities .

government press officers also summoned a number of foreign journalists based in havana to complain that they had covered the event and allowed themselves to be " manipulated and used " by diplomats seeking publicity .
" the message was of criticism about the visit , meddling in cuban internal affairs and putting at risk the political dialog .
it was a pretty strong move , " a european diplomat was quoted as saying by news agency reuters .
" a question mark " on arrest on thursday , the diplomats from germany , sweden , hungary , poland and great britain visited the home of prominent cuban dissident and physician , darsi ferrer , to bring his his wife food , clothing and other donations .
ferer was arrested and jailed on july 21 .
he faces charges of illegal economic activity for buying two sacks of cement on the black market to repair his house . his wife told foreign media that the government was accusing him of alleged criminal acts to avoid having to admit that he is a political prisoner .
" there 's a question mark when it comes to this arrest , " swedish diplomat ingemar cederberg told reuters . " there are accusations that belong to the category of common crime , not really political , and -lrb- our visit -rrb- is a way of showing our interest that the case should advance and get clarified . "
eu concerns about human rights as a political activist , ferrer organizes a march in havana every year calling on the cuban government to respect human rights .
ferrer is an independent journalist and regularly publishes surveys and investigations about the social situation in cuba .
he is currently supporting a " people 's petition " to legalize the private ownership of property on the communist-ruled island .
last october , cuba and the eu began a diplomatic dialog and cautious process of easing tensions after a period of frosty relations following cuba 's mass incarceration of opposition leaders in 2003 .
despite improved relations with cuba , the european union remains concerned about the communist government 's treatment of political opponents .
the cuban commission on human rights said in a recent report that there were 208 political prisoners on the island. gb / epd / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mihai ghimpu is the first non-communist to hold the post since 2001 . members of the for european integration alliance unanimously elected mihai ghimpu to the post on friday .
the communists , the only party outside of the alliance with seats in parliament , had walked out of the session after the alliance refused to delay the election .
they have vowed to challenge the vote in court .
" this is proof of changes in the country that voters were waiting for , " gimpu told news agency dpa . " i am confident that -lrb- the ruling coalition -rrb- will move moldova dynamically on the path of integration into the family of european nations . "
the alliance also said friday that it had decided to nominate democratic party leader marian lupu , who defected from the communist party earlier in the year , for president .
they 'll have to sway at least eight communist deputies to get the 61 votes required to elect lupu as president . liberal democratic party head vlad filat was nominated for prime minister .
the coalition , which consists of the liberal democratic party , democratic party , liberal party and the our moldova party , won a majority in july elections , gaining 53 of the parliament 's 101 seats .
the communist party won the remaining 48 .
the government of moldova , europe 's poorest country , has been in disarray since april , when parliamentary elections resulted in a communist majority amid accusations of widespread vote fraud .
one person was killed and more than 300 injured in street clashes between police and protesters .
however , the communists could not get enough votes to elect a successor to outgoing president vladimir voronin .
that led to another round of parliamentary elections last month .
the communists and their party chief voronin , have controlled moldova for the past nine years .
the party advocates stronger ties with russia , political distance from neighboring romania , and a policy of neutrality .
the ruling alliance favors closer ties with the european union and has named anti-corruption measures , a free and more open media , and pulling the country out of a steep recession as its leading priorities .

it was not clear whether the detainees were being transported to the portuguese mainland .
the two syrian detainees " are not subject to any charge , they are free people and are living in homes provided by -lsb- the -rsb- state , " portuguese officials were quoted as saying by afp news agency .
the us has asked european countries to accommodate former inmates who can not return to their countries of origin because of the risk of persecution .
release part of obama plans to close guantanamo the two men are the latest detainees to be transferred out of the prison camp on cuba , as us president barack obama tries to close the controversial facility by january .
so far , a dozen suspected militants have already been been released since obama took office seven months ago .
one inmate has been sent to new york to await trial in a us court .
more than ten are waiting to be released after us federal courts ruled they were innocent of any wrongdoing .
most are waiting for third countries to take them in .
some us lawmakers are sceptical that obama can resolve the cases of the remaining 226 prisoners held at guantanamo bay by the mid-january deadline he set .
the announcement that the two syrians would be released came days after one of the youngest detainees held at the us " war on terror " prison was returned to his native afghanistan , and a week after the white house said a group of six detainees would be freed soon .
the bush administration opened the prison to hold suspected islamist militants after the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 29.08.2009 moldova elects new pro-europe parliamentary speaker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihai ghimpu is the first non-communist parliamentary speaker in moldova since 2001 moldova 's pro-western government coalition has elected its candidate to the post of parliament speaker after a walkout by communist legislators .
mihai ghimpu is the first non-communist to hold the post since 2001 . members of the for european integration alliance unanimously elected mihai ghimpu to the post on friday .
the communists , the only party outside of the alliance with seats in parliament , had walked out of the session after the alliance refused to delay the election .
they have vowed to challenge the vote in court .
" this is proof of changes in the country that voters were waiting for , " gimpu told news agency dpa . " i am confident that -lrb- the ruling coalition -rrb- will move moldova dynamically on the path of integration into the family of european nations . "
the alliance also said friday that it had decided to nominate democratic party leader marian lupu , who defected from the communist party earlier in the year , for president .
they 'll have to sway at least eight communist deputies to get the 61 votes required to elect lupu as president . liberal democratic party head vlad filat was nominated for prime minister .
the coalition , which consists of the liberal democratic party , democratic party , liberal party and the our moldova party , won a majority in july elections , gaining 53 of the parliament 's 101 seats .
the communist party won the remaining 48 .
the government of moldova , europe 's poorest country , has been in disarray since april , when parliamentary elections resulted in a communist majority amid accusations of widespread vote fraud .
one person was killed and more than 300 injured in street clashes between police and protesters .
however , the communists could not get enough votes to elect a successor to outgoing president vladimir voronin .
that led to another round of parliamentary elections last month .
the communists and their party chief voronin , have controlled moldova for the past nine years .

government press officers also summoned a number of foreign journalists based in havana to complain that they had covered the event and allowed themselves to be " manipulated and used " by diplomats seeking publicity .
" the message was of criticism about the visit , meddling in cuban internal affairs and putting at risk the political dialog .
it was a pretty strong move , " a european diplomat was quoted as saying by news agency reuters .
" a question mark " on arrest on thursday , the diplomats from germany , sweden , hungary , poland and great britain visited the home of prominent cuban dissident and physician , darsi ferrer , to bring his his wife food , clothing and other donations .
ferer was arrested and jailed on july 21 .
he faces charges of illegal economic activity for buying two sacks of cement on the black market to repair his house . his wife told foreign media that the government was accusing him of alleged criminal acts to avoid having to admit that he is a political prisoner .
" there 's a question mark when it comes to this arrest , " swedish diplomat ingemar cederberg told reuters . " there are accusations that belong to the category of common crime , not really political , and -lrb- our visit -rrb- is a way of showing our interest that the case should advance and get clarified . "
eu concerns about human rights as a political activist , ferrer organizes a march in havana every year calling on the cuban government to respect human rights .
ferrer is an independent journalist and regularly publishes surveys and investigations about the social situation in cuba .
he is currently supporting a " people 's petition " to legalize the private ownership of property on the communist-ruled island .
last october , cuba and the eu began a diplomatic dialog and cautious process of easing tensions after a period of frosty relations following cuba 's mass incarceration of opposition leaders in 2003 .
despite improved relations with cuba , the european union remains concerned about the communist government 's treatment of political opponents .
the cuban commission on human rights said in a recent report that there were 208 political prisoners on the island. gb / epd / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mihai ghimpu is the first non-communist to hold the post since 2001 . members of the for european integration alliance unanimously elected mihai ghimpu to the post on friday .
the communists , the only party outside of the alliance with seats in parliament , had walked out of the session after the alliance refused to delay the election .
they have vowed to challenge the vote in court .
" this is proof of changes in the country that voters were waiting for , " gimpu told news agency dpa . " i am confident that -lrb- the ruling coalition -rrb- will move moldova dynamically on the path of integration into the family of european nations . "
the alliance also said friday that it had decided to nominate democratic party leader marian lupu , who defected from the communist party earlier in the year , for president .
they 'll have to sway at least eight communist deputies to get the 61 votes required to elect lupu as president . liberal democratic party head vlad filat was nominated for prime minister .
the coalition , which consists of the liberal democratic party , democratic party , liberal party and the our moldova party , won a majority in july elections , gaining 53 of the parliament 's 101 seats .
the communist party won the remaining 48 .
the government of moldova , europe 's poorest country , has been in disarray since april , when parliamentary elections resulted in a communist majority amid accusations of widespread vote fraud .
one person was killed and more than 300 injured in street clashes between police and protesters .
however , the communists could not get enough votes to elect a successor to outgoing president vladimir voronin .
that led to another round of parliamentary elections last month .
the communists and their party chief voronin , have controlled moldova for the past nine years .
the party advocates stronger ties with russia , political distance from neighboring romania , and a policy of neutrality .
the ruling alliance favors closer ties with the european union and has named anti-corruption measures , a free and more open media , and pulling the country out of a steep recession as its leading priorities .

mihai ghimpu is the first non-communist to hold the post since 2001 . members of the for european integration alliance unanimously elected mihai ghimpu to the post on friday .
the communists , the only party outside of the alliance with seats in parliament , had walked out of the session after the alliance refused to delay the election .
they have vowed to challenge the vote in court .
" this is proof of changes in the country that voters were waiting for , " gimpu told news agency dpa . " i am confident that -lrb- the ruling coalition -rrb- will move moldova dynamically on the path of integration into the family of european nations . "
the alliance also said friday that it had decided to nominate democratic party leader marian lupu , who defected from the communist party earlier in the year , for president .
they 'll have to sway at least eight communist deputies to get the 61 votes required to elect lupu as president . liberal democratic party head vlad filat was nominated for prime minister .
the coalition , which consists of the liberal democratic party , democratic party , liberal party and the our moldova party , won a majority in july elections , gaining 53 of the parliament 's 101 seats .
the communist party won the remaining 48 .
the government of moldova , europe 's poorest country , has been in disarray since april , when parliamentary elections resulted in a communist majority amid accusations of widespread vote fraud .
one person was killed and more than 300 injured in street clashes between police and protesters .
however , the communists could not get enough votes to elect a successor to outgoing president vladimir voronin .
that led to another round of parliamentary elections last month .
the communists and their party chief voronin , have controlled moldova for the past nine years .
the party advocates stronger ties with russia , political distance from neighboring romania , and a policy of neutrality .
the ruling alliance favors closer ties with the european union and has named anti-corruption measures , a free and more open media , and pulling the country out of a steep recession as its leading priorities .
the moldovan economy is expected to shrink by nine percent this year. svs / ap / dpa / reuters / dw editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but germany 's government-run casting agency , the artists ' division of the german federal employment agency , gives potential stars a chance to land roles without having to wear out too much shoe leather . not everyone gets taken on by the artists ' division , which holds auditions on a regular basis .
applicants often come straight out of school , but long-time performers also come to strut their stuff in the hopes of getting on the agency 's roster . the agency represents artists of all stripes , from actors and singers to extras , cameramen , lighting specialists and models . holding auditions " throughout europe , only germany has a state-run agency for artists , and for such a broad spectrum , " said altera piccolo , one of the talent agents employed by the government . piccolo herself came out of the performing arts ; her background is in ballet and cultural management .
she is based in cologne , one of seven cities across germany whose employment office has an artists ' division .
the others are berlin , hamburg , hanover , leipzig , munich and stuttgart . it is up to piccolo and her co-workers to say whether the candidates are up to snuff , or if they need to keep working on their material and try again .
sometimes , applicants are simply told to go look for another career , but mostly the agents try and help guide people in their career path . piccolo 's co-worker berenike juergens studied directing and used to work in theater management .

six months later , she was taken on as a client .

hans juergen moll is in charge of securing extras for the state theater in bonn .

it was not clear whether the detainees were being transported to the portuguese mainland .
the two syrian detainees " are not subject to any charge , they are free people and are living in homes provided by -lsb- the -rsb- state , " portuguese officials were quoted as saying by afp news agency .
the us has asked european countries to accommodate former inmates who can not return to their countries of origin because of the risk of persecution .
release part of obama plans to close guantanamo the two men are the latest detainees to be transferred out of the prison camp on cuba , as us president barack obama tries to close the controversial facility by january .

one inmate has been sent to new york to await trial in a us court .

some us lawmakers are sceptical that obama can resolve the cases of the remaining 226 prisoners held at guantanamo bay by the mid-january deadline he set .
the announcement that the two syrians would be released came days after one of the youngest detainees held at the us " war on terror " prison was returned to his native afghanistan , and a week after the white house said a group of six detainees would be freed soon .

government press officers also summoned a number of foreign journalists based in havana to complain that they had covered the event and allowed themselves to be " manipulated and used " by diplomats seeking publicity .
" the message was of criticism about the visit , meddling in cuban internal affairs and putting at risk the political dialog .
it was a pretty strong move , " a european diplomat was quoted as saying by news agency reuters .
" a question mark " on arrest on thursday , the diplomats from germany , sweden , hungary , poland and great britain visited the home of prominent cuban dissident and physician , darsi ferrer , to bring his his wife food , clothing and other donations .
ferer was arrested and jailed on july 21 .
he faces charges of illegal economic activity for buying two sacks of cement on the black market to repair his house . his wife told foreign media that the government was accusing him of alleged criminal acts to avoid having to admit that he is a political prisoner .
" there 's a question mark when it comes to this arrest , " swedish diplomat ingemar cederberg told reuters . " there are accusations that belong to the category of common crime , not really political , and -lrb- our visit -rrb- is a way of showing our interest that the case should advance and get clarified . "
eu concerns about human rights as a political activist , ferrer organizes a march in havana every year calling on the cuban government to respect human rights .
ferrer is an independent journalist and regularly publishes surveys and investigations about the social situation in cuba .
he is currently supporting a " people 's petition " to legalize the private ownership of property on the communist-ruled island .
last october , cuba and the eu began a diplomatic dialog and cautious process of easing tensions after a period of frosty relations following cuba 's mass incarceration of opposition leaders in 2003 .
despite improved relations with cuba , the european union remains concerned about the communist government 's treatment of political opponents .
the cuban commission on human rights said in a recent report that there were 208 political prisoners on the island. gb / epd / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mihai ghimpu is the first non-communist to hold the post since 2001 . members of the for european integration alliance unanimously elected mihai ghimpu to the post on friday .
the communists , the only party outside of the alliance with seats in parliament , had walked out of the session after the alliance refused to delay the election .
they have vowed to challenge the vote in court .
" this is proof of changes in the country that voters were waiting for , " gimpu told news agency dpa . " i am confident that -lrb- the ruling coalition -rrb- will move moldova dynamically on the path of integration into the family of european nations . "
the alliance also said friday that it had decided to nominate democratic party leader marian lupu , who defected from the communist party earlier in the year , for president .
they 'll have to sway at least eight communist deputies to get the 61 votes required to elect lupu as president . liberal democratic party head vlad filat was nominated for prime minister .
the coalition , which consists of the liberal democratic party , democratic party , liberal party and the our moldova party , won a majority in july elections , gaining 53 of the parliament 's 101 seats .
the communist party won the remaining 48 .
the government of moldova , europe 's poorest country , has been in disarray since april , when parliamentary elections resulted in a communist majority amid accusations of widespread vote fraud .
one person was killed and more than 300 injured in street clashes between police and protesters .
however , the communists could not get enough votes to elect a successor to outgoing president vladimir voronin .
that led to another round of parliamentary elections last month .
the communists and their party chief voronin , have controlled moldova for the past nine years .
the party advocates stronger ties with russia , political distance from neighboring romania , and a policy of neutrality .
the ruling alliance favors closer ties with the european union and has named anti-corruption measures , a free and more open media , and pulling the country out of a steep recession as its leading priorities .

government press officers also summoned a number of foreign journalists based in havana to complain that they had covered the event and allowed themselves to be " manipulated and used " by diplomats seeking publicity .
" the message was of criticism about the visit , meddling in cuban internal affairs and putting at risk the political dialog .
it was a pretty strong move , " a european diplomat was quoted as saying by news agency reuters .
" a question mark " on arrest on thursday , the diplomats from germany , sweden , hungary , poland and great britain visited the home of prominent cuban dissident and physician , darsi ferrer , to bring his his wife food , clothing and other donations .
ferer was arrested and jailed on july 21 .
he faces charges of illegal economic activity for buying two sacks of cement on the black market to repair his house . his wife told foreign media that the government was accusing him of alleged criminal acts to avoid having to admit that he is a political prisoner .
" there 's a question mark when it comes to this arrest , " swedish diplomat ingemar cederberg told reuters . " there are accusations that belong to the category of common crime , not really political , and -lrb- our visit -rrb- is a way of showing our interest that the case should advance and get clarified . "
eu concerns about human rights as a political activist , ferrer organizes a march in havana every year calling on the cuban government to respect human rights .
ferrer is an independent journalist and regularly publishes surveys and investigations about the social situation in cuba .
he is currently supporting a " people 's petition " to legalize the private ownership of property on the communist-ruled island .
last october , cuba and the eu began a diplomatic dialog and cautious process of easing tensions after a period of frosty relations following cuba 's mass incarceration of opposition leaders in 2003 .
despite improved relations with cuba , the european union remains concerned about the communist government 's treatment of political opponents .

government press officers also summoned a number of foreign journalists based in havana to complain that they had covered the event and allowed themselves to be " manipulated and used " by diplomats seeking publicity .
" the message was of criticism about the visit , meddling in cuban internal affairs and putting at risk the political dialog .
it was a pretty strong move , " a european diplomat was quoted as saying by news agency reuters .
" a question mark " on arrest on thursday , the diplomats from germany , sweden , hungary , poland and great britain visited the home of prominent cuban dissident and physician , darsi ferrer , to bring his his wife food , clothing and other donations .
ferer was arrested and jailed on july 21 .
he faces charges of illegal economic activity for buying two sacks of cement on the black market to repair his house . his wife told foreign media that the government was accusing him of alleged criminal acts to avoid having to admit that he is a political prisoner .
" there 's a question mark when it comes to this arrest , " swedish diplomat ingemar cederberg told reuters . " there are accusations that belong to the category of common crime , not really political , and -lrb- our visit -rrb- is a way of showing our interest that the case should advance and get clarified . "
eu concerns about human rights as a political activist , ferrer organizes a march in havana every year calling on the cuban government to respect human rights .
ferrer is an independent journalist and regularly publishes surveys and investigations about the social situation in cuba .
he is currently supporting a " people 's petition " to legalize the private ownership of property on the communist-ruled island .
last october , cuba and the eu began a diplomatic dialog and cautious process of easing tensions after a period of frosty relations following cuba 's mass incarceration of opposition leaders in 2003 .
despite improved relations with cuba , the european union remains concerned about the communist government 's treatment of political opponents .

mihai ghimpu is the first non-communist to hold the post since 2001 . members of the for european integration alliance unanimously elected mihai ghimpu to the post on friday .
the communists , the only party outside of the alliance with seats in parliament , had walked out of the session after the alliance refused to delay the election .
they have vowed to challenge the vote in court .
" this is proof of changes in the country that voters were waiting for , " gimpu told news agency dpa . " i am confident that -lrb- the ruling coalition -rrb- will move moldova dynamically on the path of integration into the family of european nations . "
the alliance also said friday that it had decided to nominate democratic party leader marian lupu , who defected from the communist party earlier in the year , for president .
they 'll have to sway at least eight communist deputies to get the 61 votes required to elect lupu as president . liberal democratic party head vlad filat was nominated for prime minister .
the coalition , which consists of the liberal democratic party , democratic party , liberal party and the our moldova party , won a majority in july elections , gaining 53 of the parliament 's 101 seats .
the communist party won the remaining 48 .
the government of moldova , europe 's poorest country , has been in disarray since april , when parliamentary elections resulted in a communist majority amid accusations of widespread vote fraud .
one person was killed and more than 300 injured in street clashes between police and protesters .
however , the communists could not get enough votes to elect a successor to outgoing president vladimir voronin .
that led to another round of parliamentary elections last month .
the communists and their party chief voronin , have controlled moldova for the past nine years .
the party advocates stronger ties with russia , political distance from neighboring romania , and a policy of neutrality .
the ruling alliance favors closer ties with the european union and has named anti-corruption measures , a free and more open media , and pulling the country out of a steep recession as its leading priorities .
the moldovan economy is expected to shrink by nine percent this year. svs / ap / dpa / reuters / dw editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mihai ghimpu is the first non-communist to hold the post since 2001 . members of the for european integration alliance unanimously elected mihai ghimpu to the post on friday .
the communists , the only party outside of the alliance with seats in parliament , had walked out of the session after the alliance refused to delay the election .
they have vowed to challenge the vote in court .
" this is proof of changes in the country that voters were waiting for , " gimpu told news agency dpa . " i am confident that -lrb- the ruling coalition -rrb- will move moldova dynamically on the path of integration into the family of european nations . "
the alliance also said friday that it had decided to nominate democratic party leader marian lupu , who defected from the communist party earlier in the year , for president .
they 'll have to sway at least eight communist deputies to get the 61 votes required to elect lupu as president . liberal democratic party head vlad filat was nominated for prime minister .
the coalition , which consists of the liberal democratic party , democratic party , liberal party and the our moldova party , won a majority in july elections , gaining 53 of the parliament 's 101 seats .
the communist party won the remaining 48 .
the government of moldova , europe 's poorest country , has been in disarray since april , when parliamentary elections resulted in a communist majority amid accusations of widespread vote fraud .
one person was killed and more than 300 injured in street clashes between police and protesters .
however , the communists could not get enough votes to elect a successor to outgoing president vladimir voronin .
that led to another round of parliamentary elections last month .
the communists and their party chief voronin , have controlled moldova for the past nine years .
the party advocates stronger ties with russia , political distance from neighboring romania , and a policy of neutrality .
the ruling alliance favors closer ties with the european union and has named anti-corruption measures , a free and more open media , and pulling the country out of a steep recession as its leading priorities .

mihai ghimpu is the first non-communist to hold the post since 2001 . members of the for european integration alliance unanimously elected mihai ghimpu to the post on friday .
the communists , the only party outside of the alliance with seats in parliament , had walked out of the session after the alliance refused to delay the election .
they have vowed to challenge the vote in court .
" this is proof of changes in the country that voters were waiting for , " gimpu told news agency dpa . " i am confident that -lrb- the ruling coalition -rrb- will move moldova dynamically on the path of integration into the family of european nations . "
the alliance also said friday that it had decided to nominate democratic party leader marian lupu , who defected from the communist party earlier in the year , for president .
they 'll have to sway at least eight communist deputies to get the 61 votes required to elect lupu as president . liberal democratic party head vlad filat was nominated for prime minister .
the coalition , which consists of the liberal democratic party , democratic party , liberal party and the our moldova party , won a majority in july elections , gaining 53 of the parliament 's 101 seats .
the communist party won the remaining 48 .
the government of moldova , europe 's poorest country , has been in disarray since april , when parliamentary elections resulted in a communist majority amid accusations of widespread vote fraud .
one person was killed and more than 300 injured in street clashes between police and protesters .
however , the communists could not get enough votes to elect a successor to outgoing president vladimir voronin .
that led to another round of parliamentary elections last month .
the communists and their party chief voronin , have controlled moldova for the past nine years .
the party advocates stronger ties with russia , political distance from neighboring romania , and a policy of neutrality .
the ruling alliance favors closer ties with the european union and has named anti-corruption measures , a free and more open media , and pulling the country out of a steep recession as its leading priorities .
the moldovan economy is expected to shrink by nine percent this year. svs / ap / dpa / reuters / dw editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

government press officers also summoned a number of foreign journalists based in havana to complain that they had covered the event and allowed themselves to be " manipulated and used " by diplomats seeking publicity .
" the message was of criticism about the visit , meddling in cuban internal affairs and putting at risk the political dialog .
it was a pretty strong move , " a european diplomat was quoted as saying by news agency reuters .
" a question mark " on arrest on thursday , the diplomats from germany , sweden , hungary , poland and great britain visited the home of prominent cuban dissident and physician , darsi ferrer , to bring his his wife food , clothing and other donations .
ferer was arrested and jailed on july 21 .
he faces charges of illegal economic activity for buying two sacks of cement on the black market to repair his house . his wife told foreign media that the government was accusing him of alleged criminal acts to avoid having to admit that he is a political prisoner .
" there 's a question mark when it comes to this arrest , " swedish diplomat ingemar cederberg told reuters . " there are accusations that belong to the category of common crime , not really political , and -lrb- our visit -rrb- is a way of showing our interest that the case should advance and get clarified . "
eu concerns about human rights as a political activist , ferrer organizes a march in havana every year calling on the cuban government to respect human rights .
ferrer is an independent journalist and regularly publishes surveys and investigations about the social situation in cuba .
he is currently supporting a " people 's petition " to legalize the private ownership of property on the communist-ruled island .
last october , cuba and the eu began a diplomatic dialog and cautious process of easing tensions after a period of frosty relations following cuba 's mass incarceration of opposition leaders in 2003 .
despite improved relations with cuba , the european union remains concerned about the communist government 's treatment of political opponents .
the cuban commission on human rights said in a recent report that there were 208 political prisoners on the island. gb / epd / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it lifted off from the kennedy space center in florida at 2359 edt friday -lrb- 0359 gmt saturday -rrb- .
two previous attempts to launch the orbiter had been postponed by a mix of bad weather and a technical glitch affecting its main propulsion system .
discovery 's mission will be the 30th flight dedicated to iss maintenance .
science equipment and a freezer to store research samples are among the items on board .
it also carries a new sleeping compartment , an air purification system and a treadmill to help maintain astronauts ' health .
the shuttle entered orbit eight-and-a-half minutes after launch , and is due to arrive at the iss on sunday night .
six sorties nasa plans an additional six sorties to the orbiting platform before retiring its re-useable spaceship fleet at the end of next year or early in 2011 .
managers had been discussing an early friday flight but decided to give their engineers an extra 23 hours to study the hydrogen stop-drain fuel-valve problem that thwarted the second launch effort on wednesday .
engineers now believe the unexpected signals they were getting from the propulsion system while filling the orbiter 's giant external tank on tuesday were related to a errant sensor .
heavy rain and lightning had intervened at the first launch attempt on tuesday morning .
discovery 's 13-day mission is scheduled to include three spacewalks to replace exterior science experiments , prepare the platform for the arrival of a new module next year , and to install a new ammonia storage tank and return the used one .
ammonia is used to move excess heat from inside the station to the radiators outside .
discovery will also drop off us astronaut nicole stott for a three-month stay on the iss , and pick up colleague tim kopra for the ride home .
kopra has been living on the platform for the past six weeks .
the mission is commanded by rick sturckow .

advertisement space shuttle takes off at the third attempt nasa has launched the us shuttle discovery for a mission to the international space station -lrb- iss -rrb- , with seven astronauts on board .
it lifted off from the kennedy space center in florida at 2359 edt friday -lrb- 0359 gmt saturday -rrb- .
two previous attempts to launch the orbiter had been postponed by a mix of bad weather and a technical glitch affecting its main propulsion system .
discovery 's mission will be the 30th flight dedicated to iss maintenance .
science equipment and a freezer to store research samples are among the items on board .
it also carries a new sleeping compartment , an air purification system and a treadmill to help maintain astronauts ' health .
the shuttle entered orbit eight-and-a-half minutes after launch , and is due to arrive at the iss on sunday night .
six sorties nasa plans an additional six sorties to the orbiting platform before retiring its re-useable spaceship fleet at the end of next year or early in 2011 .
managers had been discussing an early friday flight but decided to give their engineers an extra 23 hours to study the hydrogen stop-drain fuel-valve problem that thwarted the second launch effort on wednesday .
engineers now believe the unexpected signals they were getting from the propulsion system while filling the orbiter 's giant external tank on tuesday were related to a errant sensor .
engineers needed more time to tackle a technical glitch heavy rain and lightning had intervened at the first launch attempt on tuesday morning .
discovery 's 13-day mission is scheduled to include three spacewalks to replace exterior science experiments , prepare the platform for the arrival of a new module next year , and to install a new ammonia storage tank and return the used one .
ammonia is used to move excess heat from inside the station to the radiators outside .
discovery will also drop off us astronaut nicole stott for a three-month stay on the iss , and pick up colleague tim kopra for the ride home .
kopra has been living on the platform for the past six weeks .
the mission is commanded by rick sturckow .
