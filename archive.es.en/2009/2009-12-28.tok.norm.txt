while the tone across the pond has changed drastically , on substance many disagreements remain between the two sides . when german chancellor angela merkel was one of the last major european leaders to have her first official white house visit with barack obama the media speculated that the personal chemistry between chancellor and president was n't right .
but just when it mattered most , the popular president came around for merkel .
with months to go before germany 's general election in september , obama told merkel during her visit to washington in june that he thought she had already won the contest , adding that he did n't understand why she worried so much about it .
the unusually frank exchange , captured by a german television crew , not only showed the two leaders getting along just fine , it also provided a welcome boost for merkel 's international stature back home from a president who was and still is more popular in germany than any national politician .
further proof of how highly merkel is regarded by the new president was her invitation to speak before both houses of congress .
the address to congress took place only weeks after the german election , but was scheduled months ago with the obvious assumption that merkel would be reelected . the good personal chemistry between president and chancellor and obama 's immense international popularity has smoothed over some quite profound differences on major topics .
afghanistan : starting with his famous speech in berlin as a presidential candidate , president obama has repeatedly made it clear that he unlike his predecessor will listen and take into account the advice and concerns of us allies on important international issues .
but he added that he also expected europe to make a fresh start in transatlantic relations and not only voice concerns , but help shape a positive solution to shared problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan the prime testing ground for this new approach is of course afghanistan .
but while the us under obama has made significant changes in its afghan strategy starting with the replacement of the isaf commander , a new focus on counterinsurgency and protection of civilians and a troop surge , germany 's stance remains pretty much the same .
berlin has all but ruled out deploying troops to the more dangerous southern part of the country and in fact is very reluctant to significantly increase its military contingent at all .
despite obama 's hope for a stronger german role in afghanistan , the new center-right government 's position is largely unchanged from that of the grand coalition during the presidency of george w. bush .
financial crisis : while germany and the us agree on the broad goal of mitigating the effects of the worst recession since the 1930s and reforming the global financial system , berlin and washington are not on the same page when it comes to how this can be accomplished .
the german government contends that the goal of stimulating the economy has to be balanced against fiscal responsibility .
for the us administration however , restarting the economy clearly trumps concerns about fiscal stability .
consequently , right after taking office obama repeatedly pushed hard for germany to increase its stimulus packages that the white house viewed as too small .
the same is true when it comes to reforming the financial sector .
to be sure , according to a recent analysis by bloomberg , not one measure that would overhaul the financial system has been put into action in europe or the us .
but while germany by requiring banks to improve their financial resilience has at least made a stab at reform , the us so far has n't .
there 's also great reluctance in the us to back european proposals to curb bankers ' bonuses , a move that would have little economic relevance , but huge public significance .
however , neither germany nor the us have made serious efforts to split up the so called too-big-to fail universal banks , a measure that is supported by experts like joseph stiglitz and paul volcker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has a tough time getting climate change through congress climate change : the new us administration by acknowledging the problem and by vowing to take an active role in combating climate change reversed the stance of bush presidency - at least in theory .
but as observers in germany have had to learn against the backdrop of the failed negotiations at the copenhagen climate conference , even an american president who supports european efforts to curb global warming can not by himself convince a reluctant congress to sign on to an international climate change treaty . so what then is the state of us-german relations in year one of the obama presidency ?
compared to the bush administration , the rhetoric and the tone in the transatlantic conversation improved dramatically under president obama .
as promised during his election campaign , he has tried to seriously consult and engage with germany and other european partners and focused on a multilateral approach .
for this he has been rewarded with strong approval ratings in germany and europe .
on substance , however , there is little change in transatlantic affairs .
when push comes to shove , when words need to be translated into action the current leaderships in the us and germany have not behaved very differently to those under the previous administrations .
that is true not just on afghanistan , the financial crisis and climate change , but also on other issues such as how to deal with the guantanamo prisoners .

while the tone across the pond has changed drastically , on substance many disagreements remain between the two sides . when german chancellor angela merkel was one of the last major european leaders to have her first official white house visit with barack obama the media speculated that the personal chemistry between chancellor and president was n't right .
but just when it mattered most , the popular president came around for merkel .
with months to go before germany 's general election in september , obama told merkel during her visit to washington in june that he thought she had already won the contest , adding that he did n't understand why she worried so much about it .
the unusually frank exchange , captured by a german television crew , not only showed the two leaders getting along just fine , it also provided a welcome boost for merkel 's international stature back home from a president who was and still is more popular in germany than any national politician .
further proof of how highly merkel is regarded by the new president was her invitation to speak before both houses of congress .
the address to congress took place only weeks after the german election , but was scheduled months ago with the obvious assumption that merkel would be reelected . the good personal chemistry between president and chancellor and obama 's immense international popularity has smoothed over some quite profound differences on major topics .
afghanistan : starting with his famous speech in berlin as a presidential candidate , president obama has repeatedly made it clear that he unlike his predecessor will listen and take into account the advice and concerns of us allies on important international issues .
but he added that he also expected europe to make a fresh start in transatlantic relations and not only voice concerns , but help shape a positive solution to shared problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan the prime testing ground for this new approach is of course afghanistan .
but while the us under obama has made significant changes in its afghan strategy starting with the replacement of the isaf commander , a new focus on counterinsurgency and protection of civilians and a troop surge , germany 's stance remains pretty much the same .
berlin has all but ruled out deploying troops to the more dangerous southern part of the country and in fact is very reluctant to significantly increase its military contingent at all .
despite obama 's hope for a stronger german role in afghanistan , the new center-right government 's position is largely unchanged from that of the grand coalition during the presidency of george w. bush .
financial crisis : while germany and the us agree on the broad goal of mitigating the effects of the worst recession since the 1930s and reforming the global financial system , berlin and washington are not on the same page when it comes to how this can be accomplished .
the german government contends that the goal of stimulating the economy has to be balanced against fiscal responsibility .
for the us administration however , restarting the economy clearly trumps concerns about fiscal stability .
consequently , right after taking office obama repeatedly pushed hard for germany to increase its stimulus packages that the white house viewed as too small .
the same is true when it comes to reforming the financial sector .
to be sure , according to a recent analysis by bloomberg , not one measure that would overhaul the financial system has been put into action in europe or the us .
but while germany by requiring banks to improve their financial resilience has at least made a stab at reform , the us so far has n't .
there 's also great reluctance in the us to back european proposals to curb bankers ' bonuses , a move that would have little economic relevance , but huge public significance .
however , neither germany nor the us have made serious efforts to split up the so called too-big-to fail universal banks , a measure that is supported by experts like joseph stiglitz and paul volcker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has a tough time getting climate change through congress climate change : the new us administration by acknowledging the problem and by vowing to take an active role in combating climate change reversed the stance of bush presidency - at least in theory .
but as observers in germany have had to learn against the backdrop of the failed negotiations at the copenhagen climate conference , even an american president who supports european efforts to curb global warming can not by himself convince a reluctant congress to sign on to an international climate change treaty . so what then is the state of us-german relations in year one of the obama presidency ?
compared to the bush administration , the rhetoric and the tone in the transatlantic conversation improved dramatically under president obama .
as promised during his election campaign , he has tried to seriously consult and engage with germany and other european partners and focused on a multilateral approach .
for this he has been rewarded with strong approval ratings in germany and europe .
on substance , however , there is little change in transatlantic affairs .
when push comes to shove , when words need to be translated into action the current leaderships in the us and germany have not behaved very differently to those under the previous administrations .
that is true not just on afghanistan , the financial crisis and climate change , but also on other issues such as how to deal with the guantanamo prisoners .

while the tone across the pond has changed drastically , on substance many disagreements remain between the two sides . when german chancellor angela merkel was one of the last major european leaders to have her first official white house visit with barack obama the media speculated that the personal chemistry between chancellor and president was n't right .
but just when it mattered most , the popular president came around for merkel .
with months to go before germany 's general election in september , obama told merkel during her visit to washington in june that he thought she had already won the contest , adding that he did n't understand why she worried so much about it .
the unusually frank exchange , captured by a german television crew , not only showed the two leaders getting along just fine , it also provided a welcome boost for merkel 's international stature back home from a president who was and still is more popular in germany than any national politician .
further proof of how highly merkel is regarded by the new president was her invitation to speak before both houses of congress .
the address to congress took place only weeks after the german election , but was scheduled months ago with the obvious assumption that merkel would be reelected . the good personal chemistry between president and chancellor and obama 's immense international popularity has smoothed over some quite profound differences on major topics .
afghanistan : starting with his famous speech in berlin as a presidential candidate , president obama has repeatedly made it clear that he unlike his predecessor will listen and take into account the advice and concerns of us allies on important international issues .
but he added that he also expected europe to make a fresh start in transatlantic relations and not only voice concerns , but help shape a positive solution to shared problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan the prime testing ground for this new approach is of course afghanistan .
but while the us under obama has made significant changes in its afghan strategy starting with the replacement of the isaf commander , a new focus on counterinsurgency and protection of civilians and a troop surge , germany 's stance remains pretty much the same .
berlin has all but ruled out deploying troops to the more dangerous southern part of the country and in fact is very reluctant to significantly increase its military contingent at all .
despite obama 's hope for a stronger german role in afghanistan , the new center-right government 's position is largely unchanged from that of the grand coalition during the presidency of george w. bush .
financial crisis : while germany and the us agree on the broad goal of mitigating the effects of the worst recession since the 1930s and reforming the global financial system , berlin and washington are not on the same page when it comes to how this can be accomplished .
the german government contends that the goal of stimulating the economy has to be balanced against fiscal responsibility .
for the us administration however , restarting the economy clearly trumps concerns about fiscal stability .
consequently , right after taking office obama repeatedly pushed hard for germany to increase its stimulus packages that the white house viewed as too small .
the same is true when it comes to reforming the financial sector .
to be sure , according to a recent analysis by bloomberg , not one measure that would overhaul the financial system has been put into action in europe or the us .
but while germany by requiring banks to improve their financial resilience has at least made a stab at reform , the us so far has n't .
there 's also great reluctance in the us to back european proposals to curb bankers ' bonuses , a move that would have little economic relevance , but huge public significance .
however , neither germany nor the us have made serious efforts to split up the so called too-big-to fail universal banks , a measure that is supported by experts like joseph stiglitz and paul volcker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has a tough time getting climate change through congress climate change : the new us administration by acknowledging the problem and by vowing to take an active role in combating climate change reversed the stance of bush presidency - at least in theory .
but as observers in germany have had to learn against the backdrop of the failed negotiations at the copenhagen climate conference , even an american president who supports european efforts to curb global warming can not by himself convince a reluctant congress to sign on to an international climate change treaty . so what then is the state of us-german relations in year one of the obama presidency ?
compared to the bush administration , the rhetoric and the tone in the transatlantic conversation improved dramatically under president obama .
as promised during his election campaign , he has tried to seriously consult and engage with germany and other european partners and focused on a multilateral approach .
for this he has been rewarded with strong approval ratings in germany and europe .
on substance , however , there is little change in transatlantic affairs .
when push comes to shove , when words need to be translated into action the current leaderships in the us and germany have not behaved very differently to those under the previous administrations .
that is true not just on afghanistan , the financial crisis and climate change , but also on other issues such as how to deal with the guantanamo prisoners .

while the tone across the pond has changed drastically , on substance many disagreements remain between the two sides . when german chancellor angela merkel was one of the last major european leaders to have her first official white house visit with barack obama the media speculated that the personal chemistry between chancellor and president was n't right .
but just when it mattered most , the popular president came around for merkel .
with months to go before germany 's general election in september , obama told merkel during her visit to washington in june that he thought she had already won the contest , adding that he did n't understand why she worried so much about it .
the unusually frank exchange , captured by a german television crew , not only showed the two leaders getting along just fine , it also provided a welcome boost for merkel 's international stature back home from a president who was and still is more popular in germany than any national politician .
further proof of how highly merkel is regarded by the new president was her invitation to speak before both houses of congress .
the address to congress took place only weeks after the german election , but was scheduled months ago with the obvious assumption that merkel would be reelected . the good personal chemistry between president and chancellor and obama 's immense international popularity has smoothed over some quite profound differences on major topics .
afghanistan : starting with his famous speech in berlin as a presidential candidate , president obama has repeatedly made it clear that he unlike his predecessor will listen and take into account the advice and concerns of us allies on important international issues .
but he added that he also expected europe to make a fresh start in transatlantic relations and not only voice concerns , but help shape a positive solution to shared problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan the prime testing ground for this new approach is of course afghanistan .
but while the us under obama has made significant changes in its afghan strategy starting with the replacement of the isaf commander , a new focus on counterinsurgency and protection of civilians and a troop surge , germany 's stance remains pretty much the same .
berlin has all but ruled out deploying troops to the more dangerous southern part of the country and in fact is very reluctant to significantly increase its military contingent at all .
despite obama 's hope for a stronger german role in afghanistan , the new center-right government 's position is largely unchanged from that of the grand coalition during the presidency of george w. bush .
financial crisis : while germany and the us agree on the broad goal of mitigating the effects of the worst recession since the 1930s and reforming the global financial system , berlin and washington are not on the same page when it comes to how this can be accomplished .
the german government contends that the goal of stimulating the economy has to be balanced against fiscal responsibility .
for the us administration however , restarting the economy clearly trumps concerns about fiscal stability .
consequently , right after taking office obama repeatedly pushed hard for germany to increase its stimulus packages that the white house viewed as too small .
the same is true when it comes to reforming the financial sector .
to be sure , according to a recent analysis by bloomberg , not one measure that would overhaul the financial system has been put into action in europe or the us .
but while germany by requiring banks to improve their financial resilience has at least made a stab at reform , the us so far has n't .
there 's also great reluctance in the us to back european proposals to curb bankers ' bonuses , a move that would have little economic relevance , but huge public significance .
however , neither germany nor the us have made serious efforts to split up the so called too-big-to fail universal banks , a measure that is supported by experts like joseph stiglitz and paul volcker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has a tough time getting climate change through congress climate change : the new us administration by acknowledging the problem and by vowing to take an active role in combating climate change reversed the stance of bush presidency - at least in theory .
but as observers in germany have had to learn against the backdrop of the failed negotiations at the copenhagen climate conference , even an american president who supports european efforts to curb global warming can not by himself convince a reluctant congress to sign on to an international climate change treaty . so what then is the state of us-german relations in year one of the obama presidency ?
compared to the bush administration , the rhetoric and the tone in the transatlantic conversation improved dramatically under president obama .
as promised during his election campaign , he has tried to seriously consult and engage with germany and other european partners and focused on a multilateral approach .
for this he has been rewarded with strong approval ratings in germany and europe .
on substance , however , there is little change in transatlantic affairs .
when push comes to shove , when words need to be translated into action the current leaderships in the us and germany have not behaved very differently to those under the previous administrations .
that is true not just on afghanistan , the financial crisis and climate change , but also on other issues such as how to deal with the guantanamo prisoners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 28.12.2009 a rollercoaster year in north korea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us envoy stephen bosworth , arriving in north korea north korea kept the world on its toes in 2009 .
in april , it launched a rocket over north japan and left the six-nation disarmament talks .
some six weeks later , it caused quite a commotion around the world by testing a nuclear device .
but by the end of the year , pyongyang had indicated that it would come back to the negotiating table .
us diplomatic efforts under obama are thought to have been instrumental . 2009 began with the swearing-in of a new democrat president in the united states .
president barack obama indicated that he was ready to engage with pyongyang .
the new administration adopted a different approach from the previous more confrontational bush government .
but pyongyang was not interested .
in april , it provoked the ire of the international community by launching a rocket that flew over the north of japan and into the pacific .
the japanese prime minister at the time , taro aso , was incensed .
“ the rocket launch is a clear provocation that we will not tolerate , ” he insisted .
“ north korea ’ s action violates the un resolution and we will react accordingly with other states . ”
the reaction was that a strongly-worded condemnation of the rocket launch was issued .
however , it was not so strongly-worded that china and russia refused to sign .
pyongyang leaves six-nation talks pyongyang ’ s knee-jerk response was to leave the six-nation nuclear disarmament talks - again .
six weeks later , it was up to its old tricks again .
this time , it conducted a nuclear test - the second in three years .
expressing the whole international community ’ s displeasure , us secretary of state hillary clinton condemned the act : “ north korea has made a choice , ” she said .
“ it has chosen to violate the specific language of the un security council resolution 1718 .
it has ignored the international community .
it has abrogated the obligations it entered into through the six-party talks and it continues to act in a provocative and belligerent manner toward its neighbours .
there are consequences to such actions . "
however , the consequences were minor .
sanctions were tightened but not that much .
the to-ing and fro-ing continued .
two us journalists arrested and released the other main bone of contention between the us and pyongyang this year was the arrest of two us journalists in march for supposedly trespassing into north korea and spying .
diplomatic efforts and a highly-mediatised visit by former us president bill clinton were instrumental in securing their release .
they flew back to the us in august with clinton , who had been apparently asked by the women ’ s families and the white house to undertake the mission .
this marked the beginning of a significant improvement in relations between washington and pyongyang .
in november , president obama made his first official tour of asia .
“ north korea must live up to its obligations ” during his stop in south korea , he made the following statement : “ on north korea , our governments have maintained extraordinarily close cooperation and president lee and i are in full agreement on our common approach going forward . ”
“ i reaffirm my commitment to continue working together in the six-party process to achieve a definitive and comprehensive resolution of the nuclear issue , ” he continued .
“ our message is clear .
if north korea is prepared to take concrete and irreversible steps to fulfil its obligations and eliminate its nuclear weapons programme , the united states will support economic assistance and help promote its full integration into the community of nations .
that opportunity and respect will not come with threats .
north korea must live up to its obligations . ”
in december , pyongyang seemed willing to live up to these obligations , appeased by the visit of us envoy stephen bosworth and indicated it was ready to go back to the six-nation talks .
no timetable has been set but observers are optimistic about 2010 .

the thai government has denied all claims the lao hmong will face persecution once they are sent back . the operation to send the 4,000 lao hmong back across the border into laos began early monday under tight security after more than two days of preparations by thai authorities including a wide security perimeter to prevent outside access to the camp .
over 5,000 thai personnel and security had been sent to the camp in phetchabun province 370 kilometres north of bangkok , to process and deport the lao hmong who have lived in the camp over recent years .
government defends deportation thai government spokesman , panitan wattanayagorn , said the government ’ s decision had a sound legal basis .
" based on the immigration law of 1979 , we consider these people illegal immigrants " , panitan said .
" that ’ s why they have to be deported back .
we do this in good faith , in compliance with human rights standards and we have to make sure these people will be repatriated back in a safe and sound condition . "
during the vietnam war the lao hmong fought alongside the us and allied forces against the communist pathet lao .
after the communists took power in laos in 1975 , thousands fled largely to camps inside thailand .
many from the camps were resettled in countries such as the united states , canada , and australia .
" no force " international organizations such as the united nations and the united states have protested the move by the thai government .
the us state department accused thai authorities of forcibly returning the lao hmong .
the us urged the thai authorities to suspend the operation , calling it a " serious violation of international humanitarian principles " .
but panitan denied deportation was being forced on the lao hmong : " they volunteered to go back , at least on monday morning .
they have told the officers in-charge that they volunteer to go back . "
panitan said the lao authorities had promised those sent back would be granted an amnesty in laos .
he also said many of a group of 150 lao hmong refugees currently held at nong khai , the thai border town with laos , have been screened and would be eligible for asylum in a third country , largely expected to be the united states .
human rights groups concerned but us-based human rights watch said the thai government ’ s deportation of the lao hmong was in breach of international standards .
sunai pasuk , the group ’ s representative in thailand , said , " the deportation is carried out without proper screening .
so there is no guarantee at all that thailand is not sending people that deserve to be protected under international law back to laos .
in this regard this is a serious violation of international law and of human rights principles . "
the un refugee agency unhcr blames human traffickers for the lao hmong ’ s plight , also adding that many would qualify for asylum or refugee status if properly screened .

the thai government has denied all claims the lao hmong will face persecution once they are sent back . the operation to send the 4,000 lao hmong back across the border into laos began early monday under tight security after more than two days of preparations by thai authorities including a wide security perimeter to prevent outside access to the camp .
over 5,000 thai personnel and security had been sent to the camp in phetchabun province 370 kilometres north of bangkok , to process and deport the lao hmong who have lived in the camp over recent years .
government defends deportation thai government spokesman , panitan wattanayagorn , said the government ’ s decision had a sound legal basis .

some six weeks later , it caused quite a commotion around the world by testing a nuclear device .
but by the end of the year , pyongyang had indicated that it would come back to the negotiating table .
us diplomatic efforts under obama are thought to have been instrumental . 2009 began with the swearing-in of a new democrat president in the united states .
president barack obama indicated that he was ready to engage with pyongyang .
the new administration adopted a different approach from the previous more confrontational bush government .
but pyongyang was not interested .
in april , it provoked the ire of the international community by launching a rocket that flew over the north of japan and into the pacific .
the japanese prime minister at the time , taro aso , was incensed .
“ the rocket launch is a clear provocation that we will not tolerate , ” he insisted .
“ north korea ’ s action violates the un resolution and we will react accordingly with other states . ”
the reaction was that a strongly-worded condemnation of the rocket launch was issued .
however , it was not so strongly-worded that china and russia refused to sign .
pyongyang leaves six-nation talks pyongyang ’ s knee-jerk response was to leave the six-nation nuclear disarmament talks - again .
six weeks later , it was up to its old tricks again .
this time , it conducted a nuclear test - the second in three years .
expressing the whole international community ’ s displeasure , us secretary of state hillary clinton condemned the act : “ north korea has made a choice , ” she said .
“ it has chosen to violate the specific language of the un security council resolution 1718 .
it has ignored the international community .
it has abrogated the obligations it entered into through the six-party talks and it continues to act in a provocative and belligerent manner toward its neighbours .

however , the consequences were minor .
sanctions were tightened but not that much .
the to-ing and fro-ing continued .
two us journalists arrested and released the other main bone of contention between the us and pyongyang this year was the arrest of two us journalists in march for supposedly trespassing into north korea and spying .
diplomatic efforts and a highly-mediatised visit by former us president bill clinton were instrumental in securing their release .
they flew back to the us in august with clinton , who had been apparently asked by the women ’ s families and the white house to undertake the mission .
this marked the beginning of a significant improvement in relations between washington and pyongyang .
in november , president obama made his first official tour of asia .
“ north korea must live up to its obligations ” during his stop in south korea , he made the following statement : “ on north korea , our governments have maintained extraordinarily close cooperation and president lee and i are in full agreement on our common approach going forward . ”
“ i reaffirm my commitment to continue working together in the six-party process to achieve a definitive and comprehensive resolution of the nuclear issue , ” he continued .
“ our message is clear .
if north korea is prepared to take concrete and irreversible steps to fulfil its obligations and eliminate its nuclear weapons programme , the united states will support economic assistance and help promote its full integration into the community of nations .
that opportunity and respect will not come with threats .
north korea must live up to its obligations . ”

kyiv , however , says the dispute will not affect oil transits to the eu . russia has informed the eu that slovakia , the czech republic and hungary might be affected by a cut in russian oil supplies , slovakian prime minister robert fico said on monday .
russian oil company transneft earlier accused ukraine of setting " unacceptable " terms for oil transit .
kyiv downplayed the tensions , saying that russia 's warning to the eu was merely aimed at discrediting ukraine as a reliable transit country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : price disputes between moscow and kyiv have become an annual problem the renewed concerns come as the international monetary fund has rejected ukraine 's request for a 2 billion dollar loan to help the country meet obligations by the end of the year .
in recent years , price disputes between moscow and kyiv had repeatedly led to supply cuts which left millions of europeans in the cold .
hungary , slovakia and czech republic most hit " it 's not about a shortage of oil , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters on monday .
" it 's about a bilateral dispute between two countries who are not eu members but who are vitally important for slovakia and a few other eu nations when it comes to energy supplies . "
he said his country had received a letter warning of an " increased risk " over oil shortages and that hungary , slovakia and the czech republic would be hit hardest .
hungary 's energy ministry on monday confirmed that budapest had also been informed of russia 's warning over oil shortages from january 1 .
ukraine moved quickly to dispel any such concerns , saying that the eu had " no reasons to worry " about possible disruptions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom has downplayed worries over renewed shortages government spokesman bogdan sokolovsky said the ukrainian state energy company naftogaz was seeking higher transit fees merely so that they would reflect inflation and rising maintenance costs . russia 's transneft , however , has called the new terms for the oil transit via the ukrainian black sea port of yuzhny unacceptable .
" the process is continuing and i hope we will solve it before the new year , " transneft 's president nikolai tokarev said .
" but if they insist on their terms , we will also review the prospects of supplies . "
russia 's gas monopoly gazprom , however , said on monday there was no danger of a repeat of the gas rows with ukraine that had left parts of europe with drastic energy shortages in recent winters. ai / reuters / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ the attempted attack is not a reason for us to change the security laws , ” said bosbach .
he said that in recent years many loopholes in security had been closed , but that legislation could not eliminate human error .
bosbach said , however , that european union plans to relax certain restrictions , such as on bringing liquids onto aircraft , should probably be put on hold .
speaking to the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , he said “ the searches we have now are not a result of security hysteria , rather a necessary step . ”
a key opposition figure , the green party 's hans-christian stroebele , echoed bosbach 's assessment .
he said that last week 's attempted attack was made possible by a failure to correctly assess existing intelligence , not a lack of security .
germany wary of stepping up security the failed bomber , umar farouk abdulmutallab , was on a us watch list of people with extremist ties , and his father , a prominent nigerian banker , had contacted us authorities to say that his son may have travelled to yemen to meet with islamists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police presence at german airports has become more visible since the attempted bombing of the transatlantic flight , security has been stepped up at german airports , using the means already at the authorities ' disposal .
over the weekend , germany 's federal police warned passengers that they could expect longer waits to get through airport security .
but experts remain divided over using more intrusive search methods at airports like the much-debated full-body or " nude " scanner .
the head of a german police union , rainer wendt , said it would be a mistake to use the technology .
that device would allow security personnel to observe a computer-generated reproduction of the contours of a passenger 's body , where well-hidden weapons or explosives might be visible .
that would go “ too far ” in invading people 's privacy , he told the berliner zeitung , and called instead for a heightened police presence at german airports .
holland in favor of new , microwave detectors but on monday , dutch airport authorities said they would make new , microwave scanners mandatory after the attempted attack .
ad rutten , the chief operating officer of schiphol group , told a news conference the airport would introduce the more sensitive detectors pending approval from european authorities . the microwave scanners are not as powerful as the see-through full-body scanners that allow security staff to see passengers virtually naked and detect items swallowed or concealed inside the body .
but they can spot unusual objects on the body and hidden under clothing . ron louwerse , security director for schiphol group , said he was confident the new microwave scanners would get eu approval . " the machine so far gave indications of the body shape and it was also possible to detect whether it was a man or a woman .
this violated certain privacy rules .
we 've now made some changes and we think this will get approval from european authorities , " he said . louwerse added that schipol airport could probably fully implement the new scanners within a year . mrh / sp / dpa / apd editor : chuck penfold / susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german wikipedia site is celebrating its landmark millionth article after more than eight years of operation . the german version of the free online encyclopedia wikipedia passed a significant hurdle on sunday as it observed its one millionth entry .
the landmark article was about the american botanist ernie wasson .
some in the wikipedia community felt , however , that this topic was too insignificant and nominated it for deletion .
if that should come to pass , then an article about german speed skater robert seifert would take the honor of being the site 's one millionth article .
looking ahead the first german wikipedia article was written by biochemist magnus manske in may 2001 .
it described the so-called polymerase chain reaction , which duplicates dna in a test tube .
the german site is expecting to reach its next milestone , its two millionth entry , sometime in 2015 .
the german wiki , a collection of hyperlinked , publicly edited encyclopedic articles , is surpassed in size only by the english version , which has more than three million .
after german , the french wikipedia page has the third most entries at more than 890,000 , followed by the polish and then italian pages with 662,000 and 642,000 respectively .
across all languages there are more than 13 million wikipedia articles in more than 250 languages , according to the wikimedia foundation. sjt / dpa / glp editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after hovering both above and below that level throughout the day , it closed at 6,003 points .
" this is a psychological victory , " baader bank market analyst robert halver told dpa news agency .
" the breach of the 6,000 barrier is certainly a positive signal . "
the dax index stood at 6234 points in mid-september 2008 , before the collapse of the us-based lehman brothers investment bank triggered chaos on world financial markets ..
by march 2009 the dax had dropped to around 3,600 points , its lowest level since 2003 .
but some traders warned that low trading volumes meant recent gains should not be overvalued .
dow jones newswires quoted a deutsche bank trader as saying that trading volumes were expected to remain thin until the end of the year , and cited positive sentiment on asian markets and us movements on friday as reasons for the breakthrough .
in new york , traders were reportedly set to close 2009 on a high note , with markets expected to hold on to solid gains after staging a remarkable turnaround from a chaotic start to the year. sje / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 28.12.2009 the church reaches out to the families of german troops abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seeing a loved one leave for a conflict zone can be distressing soldiers often have to endure tough conditions when on foreign tour .
but back at home , the families and the partners of troops serving abroad also suffer . the families and partners of soldiers despatched to international conflict zones must often live with the very real fear their loved ones may not come home .
and so the military chaplaincy of the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , has launched a project to help families cope with the pressure this puts on their lives and relationships .
more than 7,000 german soldiers are currently serving on overseas missions , more than half of them in afghanistan .
in that country , the german troops are stationed in the relatively quiet north but that does n't mean they 're safe .
so far , 40 german soldiers and members of the police force have lost their lives .
the priests who accompany the german troops say this can also place a huge emotional burden on soldiers ' families back home .
for this reason , the catholic military bishopric has started a new program to help prepare families for the stresses of seeing loved ones sent away to conflict zones .
a helping hand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military chaplaincy wants the bundeswehr to do more for soldiers ' families and partners the project 's leader , peter wendl , says part of the task involves talking with military priests and couples who have already experienced foreign assignments .
he says a part of the problem is that couples often do n't talk about how they feel when one of them is sent away .
" throughout the interviews , it seemed that the fears of one partner or the other were n't articulated because they were incapable of expressing them or too insecure or because they felt helpless , " he says , " which naturally affected their relationships and their family life . "
wendl says that the fears a soldier experiences when on a dangerous patrol must be aired , and so should the fears a husband or wife back in germany may have that they could lose their partner and end up having to raise their children alone .
" we find that couples feel unbelievable relief when they get help in our seminars , and when they are given the chance to articulate their fears , " he says .
wendl has developed a training plan for the military chaplaincy which he hopes will make couples better able to cope with the stresses of foreign assignment .
the plan includes a step-by-step guide to the types of situations and crises they might go through during missions .
but wendl warns that the church is unable to do all the work for couples and families .
he says the best way to safeguard emotional wellbeing is to stay positive about the mission , and remain committed .
the burden of uncertainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are frequently targeted by insurgency attacks military dean monsignor rainer schadt has been accompanying german soldiers to crisis regions around the world since 1992 .
when it comes to germany 's current mission in afghanistan , he says military chaplains are witnessing a new challenge .
" increasingly we 're seeing not only experienced troops returning home , but also troops that have seen combat , " he says .
" this means we have another field to plough .
soldiers return home without having sustained injuries themselves , but rather have had to injure , and sometimes even kill , others in carrying out their duties .
" how families and soldiers deal with this phenomenon back at home is going to be a big part of our work in the future , " he adds .
the fear of knowing that a loved one is an enemy target can be an overwhelming burden , says this woman , whose partner served with the bundeswehr on three tours of duty abroad .
" i was afraid of what could happen , what could happen to him - the possibility that he may come back a different person from who he was when he left .
the fact that he could lose a leg or an arm , or be killed .
of course , these are the fears we have , " she says .

a helping hand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military chaplaincy wants the bundeswehr to do more for soldiers ' families and partners the project 's leader , peter wendl , says part of the task involves talking with military priests and couples who have already experienced foreign assignments .
he says a part of the problem is that couples often do n't talk about how they feel when one of them is sent away .
" throughout the interviews , it seemed that the fears of one partner or the other were n't articulated because they were incapable of expressing them or too insecure or because they felt helpless , " he says , " which naturally affected their relationships and their family life . "
wendl says that the fears a soldier experiences when on a dangerous patrol must be aired , and so should the fears a husband or wife back in germany may have that they could lose their partner and end up having to raise their children alone .
" we find that couples feel unbelievable relief when they get help in our seminars , and when they are given the chance to articulate their fears , " he says .
wendl has developed a training plan for the military chaplaincy which he hopes will make couples better able to cope with the stresses of foreign assignment .
the plan includes a step-by-step guide to the types of situations and crises they might go through during missions .
but wendl warns that the church is unable to do all the work for couples and families .
he says the best way to safeguard emotional wellbeing is to stay positive about the mission , and remain committed .
the burden of uncertainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are frequently targeted by insurgency attacks military dean monsignor rainer schadt has been accompanying german soldiers to crisis regions around the world since 1992 .
when it comes to germany 's current mission in afghanistan , he says military chaplains are witnessing a new challenge .
" increasingly we 're seeing not only experienced troops returning home , but also troops that have seen combat , " he says .
" this means we have another field to plough .
soldiers return home without having sustained injuries themselves , but rather have had to injure , and sometimes even kill , others in carrying out their duties .
" how families and soldiers deal with this phenomenon back at home is going to be a big part of our work in the future , " he adds .
the fear of knowing that a loved one is an enemy target can be an overwhelming burden , says this woman , whose partner served with the bundeswehr on three tours of duty abroad .
" i was afraid of what could happen , what could happen to him - the possibility that he may come back a different person from who he was when he left .
the fact that he could lose a leg or an arm , or be killed .
of course , these are the fears we have , " she says .

the eu said it was illegal under international law to construct further settlements on occupied palestinian land . " the presidency of the european union is dismayed at the announcement of the government of israel to build nearly 700 apartments in occupied east jerusalem , " said a statement from sweden , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
earlier on monday , israel had announced plans to build almost 700 new apartments in occupied east jerusalem .
the new homes will be located in areas which israel captured in the 1967 middle east war .
" settlements on occupied land are illegal under international law , " the eu statement said .
" the presidency of the european union thus urges the government of israel to reconsider these plans . "
the new settlement plans have already prompted strong protests from the palestinian side .
president mahmoud abbas has refused to resume peace talks without a complete israeli halt to settlement construction in east jerusalem .
the palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of their future state while israel claims both east and west jerusalem as part of its " eternal , indivisible " capital .
palestinians call on us for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas has his hopes pinned on international support from the us and the eu chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat warned the development " further sabotaged international efforts to resume permanent status negotiations . "
erekat called on the us to clarify its position on israel 's obligation to freeze all settlement construction as agreed under the 2003 road map peace plan .
later on monday , white house spokesman robert gibbs said the united states " opposes new israeli construction in east jerusalem . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 28.12.2009 german politicians wary of full-body scanners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of full-body scanners is controversial after a failed attack on a us airliner on christmas day , full-body scanners are being discussed as a possible security measure .
but german politicians are n't quite ready for that much exposure in airports . full body scanners would allow security personnel to observe a computer-generated reproduction of the contours of a passenger 's body , where well-hidden weapons or explosives might be visible . in germany , critics of the devices say the scanners are too intrusive concerning passengers ' privacy , and have called for a solution that does not reveal as much of a person 's body . " we do n't want nude scanners where the contours of the passengers ' bodies are clearly depicted on a screen , and where we ca n't be sure if the passengers ' private parts are visible , " said wolfgang bosbach , chairman of the parliamentary internal affairs committee , in an interview with ard public television . " but on the other hand , we obviously have to find a way to ensure that dangerous substances are recognized , be they solid or liquid explosives , so that materials that are n't picked up by a metal detector ca n't be smuggled on board , " he added . gisela piltz , deputy chairperson of the free democrats parliamentary party , said a device that did not reveal the private areas of a passenger 's body was the right way to find a balance between privacy and security . " if people 's dignity is to be preserved , then we should invest in this kind of a system for the security of the passengers , " piltz said in an interview with the daily newspaper rheinische post .
the white house responds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says the us will use all its resources to find those responsible meanwhile , us president barack obama has vowed to track down everyone responsible in plotting an attempted terrorist attack on an american airliner on christmas day .
speaking from hawaii on monday , obama pledged that his administration " will not rest until we find all who were involved and hold them accountable . " while al-qaeda was not specifically mentioned by obama , the group has claimed responsibility in a statement for the december 25 actions of nigerian umar farouk abdulmutallab.the 23-year-old man was charged by us authorities with attempting to blow up a northwest airlines plane en route to detroit from amsterdam with almost 300 people on board . officials say abdulmutallab met with al-qaeda operatives in yemen , where he acquired the bomb and was taught how to use it . in its statement , al-qaeda wrote that a " technical fault " caused the failure of the bomb to detonate , but said abdulmutallab 's act " dealt a huge blow to the myth of american and global intelligence services and showed how fragile its structure is . " us defenses to be tightened obama made it clear in his address that the united states would use all of its resources to combat future threats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry that full-body scanners reveal too much " we will continue to use every element of our national power to disrupt , to dismantle and defeat the violent extremists who threaten us , whether they are from afghanistan or pakistan , yemen or somalia , or anywhere where they are plotting attacks against the us homeland , " he said . the president also addressed the fact that abdulmutallab was still allowed to travel to the us despite his father 's warnings to american authorities of his extremist views , saying that a thorough review of the screening process has been ordered . " we need to determine just how the suspect was able to bring dangerous explosives aboard an aircraft and what additional steps we can take to thwart future attacks , " obama said . dutch in favor of new microwave detectors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch airport officials say they will make microwave scanners mandatory in the netherlands , airport authorities say they will make microwave scanners mandatory after the attempted attack . ad rutten , the chief operating officer of schiphol group , told reporters the airport would introduce the more sensitive detectors once they are approved by european authorities . although the microwave scanners are not as powerful as see-through full-body scanners , they can spot unusual objects hidden under clothing or on a person 's body .
the scanners are expected to be fully implemented in the country within a year. mz / mk / mrh / dpa / apd / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but german politicians are n't quite ready for that much exposure in airports . full body scanners would allow security personnel to observe a computer-generated reproduction of the contours of a passenger 's body , where well-hidden weapons or explosives might be visible . in germany , critics of the devices say the scanners are too intrusive concerning passengers ' privacy , and have called for a solution that does not reveal as much of a person 's body . " we do n't want nude scanners where the contours of the passengers ' bodies are clearly depicted on a screen , and where we ca n't be sure if the passengers ' private parts are visible , " said wolfgang bosbach , chairman of the parliamentary internal affairs committee , in an interview with ard public television . " but on the other hand , we obviously have to find a way to ensure that dangerous substances are recognized , be they solid or liquid explosives , so that materials that are n't picked up by a metal detector ca n't be smuggled on board , " he added . gisela piltz , deputy chairperson of the free democrats parliamentary party , said a device that did not reveal the private areas of a passenger 's body was the right way to find a balance between privacy and security .

the thai government has denied all claims the lao hmong will face persecution once they are sent back . the operation to send the 4,000 lao hmong back across the border into laos began early monday under tight security after more than two days of preparations by thai authorities including a wide security perimeter to prevent outside access to the camp .
over 5,000 thai personnel and security had been sent to the camp in phetchabun province 370 kilometres north of bangkok , to process and deport the lao hmong who have lived in the camp over recent years .
government defends deportation thai government spokesman , panitan wattanayagorn , said the government ’ s decision had a sound legal basis .
" based on the immigration law of 1979 , we consider these people illegal immigrants " , panitan said .
" that ’ s why they have to be deported back .
we do this in good faith , in compliance with human rights standards and we have to make sure these people will be repatriated back in a safe and sound condition . "
during the vietnam war the lao hmong fought alongside the us and allied forces against the communist pathet lao .
after the communists took power in laos in 1975 , thousands fled largely to camps inside thailand .
many from the camps were resettled in countries such as the united states , canada , and australia .
" no force " international organizations such as the united nations and the united states have protested the move by the thai government .
the us state department accused thai authorities of forcibly returning the lao hmong .
the us urged the thai authorities to suspend the operation , calling it a " serious violation of international humanitarian principles " .
but panitan denied deportation was being forced on the lao hmong : " they volunteered to go back , at least on monday morning .
they have told the officers in-charge that they volunteer to go back . "
panitan said the lao authorities had promised those sent back would be granted an amnesty in laos .
he also said many of a group of 150 lao hmong refugees currently held at nong khai , the thai border town with laos , have been screened and would be eligible for asylum in a third country , largely expected to be the united states .
human rights groups concerned but us-based human rights watch said the thai government ’ s deportation of the lao hmong was in breach of international standards .
sunai pasuk , the group ’ s representative in thailand , said , " the deportation is carried out without proper screening .
so there is no guarantee at all that thailand is not sending people that deserve to be protected under international law back to laos .
in this regard this is a serious violation of international law and of human rights principles . "
the un refugee agency unhcr blames human traffickers for the lao hmong ’ s plight , also adding that many would qualify for asylum or refugee status if properly screened .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 28.12.2009 a rollercoaster year in north korea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us envoy stephen bosworth , arriving in north korea north korea kept the world on its toes in 2009 .
in april , it launched a rocket over north japan and left the six-nation disarmament talks .
some six weeks later , it caused quite a commotion around the world by testing a nuclear device .
but by the end of the year , pyongyang had indicated that it would come back to the negotiating table .
us diplomatic efforts under obama are thought to have been instrumental . 2009 began with the swearing-in of a new democrat president in the united states .
president barack obama indicated that he was ready to engage with pyongyang .
the new administration adopted a different approach from the previous more confrontational bush government .
but pyongyang was not interested .
in april , it provoked the ire of the international community by launching a rocket that flew over the north of japan and into the pacific .
the japanese prime minister at the time , taro aso , was incensed .
“ the rocket launch is a clear provocation that we will not tolerate , ” he insisted .
“ north korea ’ s action violates the un resolution and we will react accordingly with other states . ”
the reaction was that a strongly-worded condemnation of the rocket launch was issued .
however , it was not so strongly-worded that china and russia refused to sign .
pyongyang leaves six-nation talks pyongyang ’ s knee-jerk response was to leave the six-nation nuclear disarmament talks - again .
six weeks later , it was up to its old tricks again .
this time , it conducted a nuclear test - the second in three years .
expressing the whole international community ’ s displeasure , us secretary of state hillary clinton condemned the act : “ north korea has made a choice , ” she said .
“ it has chosen to violate the specific language of the un security council resolution 1718 .
it has ignored the international community .
it has abrogated the obligations it entered into through the six-party talks and it continues to act in a provocative and belligerent manner toward its neighbours .
there are consequences to such actions . "
however , the consequences were minor .
sanctions were tightened but not that much .
the to-ing and fro-ing continued .
two us journalists arrested and released the other main bone of contention between the us and pyongyang this year was the arrest of two us journalists in march for supposedly trespassing into north korea and spying .
diplomatic efforts and a highly-mediatised visit by former us president bill clinton were instrumental in securing their release .
they flew back to the us in august with clinton , who had been apparently asked by the women ’ s families and the white house to undertake the mission .
this marked the beginning of a significant improvement in relations between washington and pyongyang .
in november , president obama made his first official tour of asia .
“ north korea must live up to its obligations ” during his stop in south korea , he made the following statement : “ on north korea , our governments have maintained extraordinarily close cooperation and president lee and i are in full agreement on our common approach going forward . ”
“ i reaffirm my commitment to continue working together in the six-party process to achieve a definitive and comprehensive resolution of the nuclear issue , ” he continued .
“ our message is clear .
if north korea is prepared to take concrete and irreversible steps to fulfil its obligations and eliminate its nuclear weapons programme , the united states will support economic assistance and help promote its full integration into the community of nations .
that opportunity and respect will not come with threats .
north korea must live up to its obligations . ”
in december , pyongyang seemed willing to live up to these obligations , appeased by the visit of us envoy stephen bosworth and indicated it was ready to go back to the six-nation talks .
no timetable has been set but observers are optimistic about 2010 .

in april , it provoked the ire of the international community by launching a rocket that flew over the north of japan and into the pacific .
the japanese prime minister at the time , taro aso , was incensed .
“ the rocket launch is a clear provocation that we will not tolerate , ” he insisted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 28.12.2009 thailand deports hmong refugees to laos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai troops surround houses in the hmong refugee camp during the deportation on monday on monday , thailand began the deportation of thousands of lao hmong asylum seekers despite international protests calling for the operation to be suspended .
the thai government has denied all claims the lao hmong will face persecution once they are sent back . the operation to send the 4,000 lao hmong back across the border into laos began early monday under tight security after more than two days of preparations by thai authorities including a wide security perimeter to prevent outside access to the camp .
over 5,000 thai personnel and security had been sent to the camp in phetchabun province 370 kilometres north of bangkok , to process and deport the lao hmong who have lived in the camp over recent years .
government defends deportation thai government spokesman , panitan wattanayagorn , said the government ’ s decision had a sound legal basis .
" based on the immigration law of 1979 , we consider these people illegal immigrants " , panitan said .
" that ’ s why they have to be deported back .
we do this in good faith , in compliance with human rights standards and we have to make sure these people will be repatriated back in a safe and sound condition . "
during the vietnam war the lao hmong fought alongside the us and allied forces against the communist pathet lao .
after the communists took power in laos in 1975 , thousands fled largely to camps inside thailand .
many from the camps were resettled in countries such as the united states , canada , and australia .
" no force " international organizations such as the united nations and the united states have protested the move by the thai government .
the us state department accused thai authorities of forcibly returning the lao hmong .
the us urged the thai authorities to suspend the operation , calling it a " serious violation of international humanitarian principles " .
but panitan denied deportation was being forced on the lao hmong : " they volunteered to go back , at least on monday morning .
they have told the officers in-charge that they volunteer to go back . "
panitan said the lao authorities had promised those sent back would be granted an amnesty in laos .
he also said many of a group of 150 lao hmong refugees currently held at nong khai , the thai border town with laos , have been screened and would be eligible for asylum in a third country , largely expected to be the united states .

the thai government has denied all claims the lao hmong will face persecution once they are sent back . the operation to send the 4,000 lao hmong back across the border into laos began early monday under tight security after more than two days of preparations by thai authorities including a wide security perimeter to prevent outside access to the camp .
over 5,000 thai personnel and security had been sent to the camp in phetchabun province 370 kilometres north of bangkok , to process and deport the lao hmong who have lived in the camp over recent years .
government defends deportation thai government spokesman , panitan wattanayagorn , said the government ’ s decision had a sound legal basis .
" based on the immigration law of 1979 , we consider these people illegal immigrants " , panitan said .
" that ’ s why they have to be deported back .
we do this in good faith , in compliance with human rights standards and we have to make sure these people will be repatriated back in a safe and sound condition . "
during the vietnam war the lao hmong fought alongside the us and allied forces against the communist pathet lao .
after the communists took power in laos in 1975 , thousands fled largely to camps inside thailand .
many from the camps were resettled in countries such as the united states , canada , and australia .

but panitan denied deportation was being forced on the lao hmong : " they volunteered to go back , at least on monday morning .
they have told the officers in-charge that they volunteer to go back . "
panitan said the lao authorities had promised those sent back would be granted an amnesty in laos .
he also said many of a group of 150 lao hmong refugees currently held at nong khai , the thai border town with laos , have been screened and would be eligible for asylum in a third country , largely expected to be the united states .

the german wikipedia site is celebrating its landmark millionth article after more than eight years of operation . the german version of the free online encyclopedia wikipedia passed a significant hurdle on sunday as it observed its one millionth entry .
the landmark article was about the american botanist ernie wasson .
some in the wikipedia community felt , however , that this topic was too insignificant and nominated it for deletion .
if that should come to pass , then an article about german speed skater robert seifert would take the honor of being the site 's one millionth article .
looking ahead the first german wikipedia article was written by biochemist magnus manske in may 2001 .
it described the so-called polymerase chain reaction , which duplicates dna in a test tube .
the german site is expecting to reach its next milestone , its two millionth entry , sometime in 2015 .
the german wiki , a collection of hyperlinked , publicly edited encyclopedic articles , is surpassed in size only by the english version , which has more than three million .
after german , the french wikipedia page has the third most entries at more than 890,000 , followed by the polish and then italian pages with 662,000 and 642,000 respectively .
across all languages there are more than 13 million wikipedia articles in more than 250 languages , according to the wikimedia foundation. sjt / dpa / glp editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after hovering both above and below that level throughout the day , it closed at 6,003 points .
" this is a psychological victory , " baader bank market analyst robert halver told dpa news agency .
" the breach of the 6,000 barrier is certainly a positive signal . "
the dax index stood at 6234 points in mid-september 2008 , before the collapse of the us-based lehman brothers investment bank triggered chaos on world financial markets ..
by march 2009 the dax had dropped to around 3,600 points , its lowest level since 2003 .
but some traders warned that low trading volumes meant recent gains should not be overvalued .
dow jones newswires quoted a deutsche bank trader as saying that trading volumes were expected to remain thin until the end of the year , and cited positive sentiment on asian markets and us movements on friday as reasons for the breakthrough .
in new york , traders were reportedly set to close 2009 on a high note , with markets expected to hold on to solid gains after staging a remarkable turnaround from a chaotic start to the year. sje / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

critics are voicing environmental concerns . germany has given its second and final approval for the nord stream project .
the 1200 kilometer-long -lrb- 745 miles -rrb- pipeline is to link the russian city of vyborg with greifswald in germany via finnish , swedish and danish waters , to provide gas to western european countries .
on monday the german federal maritime and hydrographic agency granted its permit for the 31 kilometer section in germany 's exclusive economic zone .
the permit for the 50 kilometer stretch through berlin 's territorial waters was granted on december 22 .
monday 's decision marks the final approval from germany for the 7.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- project .
approval from denmark , sweden and russia has already been granted .
finnish approval still outstanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipeline is expected to provide more stable supplies to western europe the only outstanding permit remaining is from finland but nord stream on monday said it was confident that the construction of the pipeline would go ahead as planned .
" we are firmly on schedule to start construction of the pipeline in spring 2010 and to start transporting gas in 2011 , " said the company 's managing director , matthias warnig .
the pipeline is to deliver 55 billion cubic meters of russian gas to western europe each year .
the nord stream project is led by the russian state-owned energy company gazprom in cooperation with german partners e.on ruhrgas and basf-wintershall .
criticism from ukraine and poland the project has been strongly criticized by environmentalist groups who say it puts the ecosystem of the baltic sea at risk .
poland and ukraine have criticized nord stream for taking business away from land pipelines across their territory .
warsaw and kyiv are concerned about losing both transit revenues and bargaining power when it comes to future gas supplies from russia to poland and ukraine .

violent response according to opposition sources , security forces used tear gas and live ammunition to try to get the marchers to disperse .

a spokesman for the french foreign ministry , bernard valero , said his country again expressed “ deep concern , ” and “ condemns the arbitrary arrests and violence carried out against ordinary protesters . ”
he added that intensification of repression “ would lead nowhere . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 28.12.2009 german politicians wary of full-body scanners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of full-body scanners is controversial after a failed attack on a us airliner on christmas day , full-body scanners are being discussed as a possible security measure .
but german politicians are n't quite ready for that much exposure in airports . full body scanners would allow security personnel to observe a computer-generated reproduction of the contours of a passenger 's body , where well-hidden weapons or explosives might be visible . in germany , critics of the devices say the scanners are too intrusive concerning passengers ' privacy , and have called for a solution that does not reveal as much of a person 's body . " we do n't want nude scanners where the contours of the passengers ' bodies are clearly depicted on a screen , and where we ca n't be sure if the passengers ' private parts are visible , " said wolfgang bosbach , chairman of the parliamentary internal affairs committee , in an interview with ard public television . " but on the other hand , we obviously have to find a way to ensure that dangerous substances are recognized , be they solid or liquid explosives , so that materials that are n't picked up by a metal detector ca n't be smuggled on board , " he added . gisela piltz , deputy chairperson of the free democrats parliamentary party , said a device that did not reveal the private areas of a passenger 's body was the right way to find a balance between privacy and security . " if people 's dignity is to be preserved , then we should invest in this kind of a system for the security of the passengers , " piltz said in an interview with the daily newspaper rheinische post .
the white house responds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says the us will use all its resources to find those responsible meanwhile , us president barack obama has vowed to track down everyone responsible in plotting an attempted terrorist attack on an american airliner on christmas day .
speaking from hawaii on monday , obama pledged that his administration " will not rest until we find all who were involved and hold them accountable . " while al-qaeda was not specifically mentioned by obama , the group has claimed responsibility in a statement for the december 25 actions of nigerian umar farouk abdulmutallab.the 23-year-old man was charged by us authorities with attempting to blow up a northwest airlines plane en route to detroit from amsterdam with almost 300 people on board . officials say abdulmutallab met with al-qaeda operatives in yemen , where he acquired the bomb and was taught how to use it . in its statement , al-qaeda wrote that a " technical fault " caused the failure of the bomb to detonate , but said abdulmutallab 's act " dealt a huge blow to the myth of american and global intelligence services and showed how fragile its structure is . " us defenses to be tightened obama made it clear in his address that the united states would use all of its resources to combat future threats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry that full-body scanners reveal too much " we will continue to use every element of our national power to disrupt , to dismantle and defeat the violent extremists who threaten us , whether they are from afghanistan or pakistan , yemen or somalia , or anywhere where they are plotting attacks against the us homeland , " he said . the president also addressed the fact that abdulmutallab was still allowed to travel to the us despite his father 's warnings to american authorities of his extremist views , saying that a thorough review of the screening process has been ordered . " we need to determine just how the suspect was able to bring dangerous explosives aboard an aircraft and what additional steps we can take to thwart future attacks , " obama said . dutch in favor of new microwave detectors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch airport officials say they will make microwave scanners mandatory in the netherlands , airport authorities say they will make microwave scanners mandatory after the attempted attack . ad rutten , the chief operating officer of schiphol group , told reporters the airport would introduce the more sensitive detectors once they are approved by european authorities . although the microwave scanners are not as powerful as see-through full-body scanners , they can spot unusual objects hidden under clothing or on a person 's body .
the scanners are expected to be fully implemented in the country within a year. mz / mk / mrh / dpa / apd / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schmitt says the youngster , who turns 19 next week , is a very calm and collected roommate , especially before a competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal bodmer is in his second four hills tournament " normally before i compete i 'm antsy and running around the room , " schmitt told the german news agency dpa .

" ' this will be bodmer 's second four hills tournament , and while his expectations are higher than the first time -lrb- " last year it was just important to be in the tournament " -rrb- , he 's still got to beat out the likes of ammann and schlierenzauer for a chance at a medal . competition from across the border switzerland 's ammann maintains an edge with three victories on the world cup circuit this season already under his belt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon ammann , far left , with last year 's winner wolfgang loitzl , center and finland 's harri olli the two-time gold medalist from the 2002 olympics is hoping to become the first swiss winner of the four hills . last year , he came a disappointing eighth place in the third round of the four hills at innsbruck , which ended his hopes of winning the prestigious title . he 'll face stiff competition from the much younger schlierenzauer . the 19-year-old austrian ski jumper has already chalked up 26 world cup wins .
and he came third in last year 's four hills event . " i am in form , i 'm in a hurry to take part in the four hills , " schlierenzauer said . the four hills contest has a tradition of producing surprise winners .
last year , austria 's wolfgang loitzl clinched three victories and a second place to storm to four hills victory . from oberstdorf , the four hills tournament moves on to garmisch-partenkirchen , and then to the austrian resorts of innsbruck and bischofshofen . mz / sp / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ the attempted attack is not a reason for us to change the security laws , ” said bosbach .
he said that in recent years many loopholes in security had been closed , but that legislation could not eliminate human error .
bosbach said , however , that european union plans to relax certain restrictions , such as on bringing liquids onto aircraft , should probably be put on hold .
speaking to the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , he said “ the searches we have now are not a result of security hysteria , rather a necessary step . ”
a key opposition figure , the green party 's hans-christian stroebele , echoed bosbach 's assessment .
he said that last week 's attempted attack was made possible by a failure to correctly assess existing intelligence , not a lack of security .
germany wary of stepping up security the failed bomber , umar farouk abdulmutallab , was on a us watch list of people with extremist ties , and his father , a prominent nigerian banker , had contacted us authorities to say that his son may have travelled to yemen to meet with islamists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police presence at german airports has become more visible since the attempted bombing of the transatlantic flight , security has been stepped up at german airports , using the means already at the authorities ' disposal .
over the weekend , germany 's federal police warned passengers that they could expect longer waits to get through airport security .
but experts remain divided over using more intrusive search methods at airports like the much-debated full-body or " nude " scanner .
the head of a german police union , rainer wendt , said it would be a mistake to use the technology .
that device would allow security personnel to observe a computer-generated reproduction of the contours of a passenger 's body , where well-hidden weapons or explosives might be visible .
that would go “ too far ” in invading people 's privacy , he told the berliner zeitung , and called instead for a heightened police presence at german airports .
holland in favor of new , microwave detectors but on monday , dutch airport authorities said they would make new , microwave scanners mandatory after the attempted attack .
ad rutten , the chief operating officer of schiphol group , told a news conference the airport would introduce the more sensitive detectors pending approval from european authorities . the microwave scanners are not as powerful as the see-through full-body scanners that allow security staff to see passengers virtually naked and detect items swallowed or concealed inside the body .
but they can spot unusual objects on the body and hidden under clothing . ron louwerse , security director for schiphol group , said he was confident the new microwave scanners would get eu approval . " the machine so far gave indications of the body shape and it was also possible to detect whether it was a man or a woman .
this violated certain privacy rules .
we 've now made some changes and we think this will get approval from european authorities , " he said . louwerse added that schipol airport could probably fully implement the new scanners within a year . mrh / sp / dpa / apd editor : chuck penfold / susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but german politicians are n't quite ready for that much exposure in airports . full body scanners would allow security personnel to observe a computer-generated reproduction of the contours of a passenger 's body , where well-hidden weapons or explosives might be visible . in germany , critics of the devices say the scanners are too intrusive concerning passengers ' privacy , and have called for a solution that does not reveal as much of a person 's body . " we do n't want nude scanners where the contours of the passengers ' bodies are clearly depicted on a screen , and where we ca n't be sure if the passengers ' private parts are visible , " said wolfgang bosbach , chairman of the parliamentary internal affairs committee , in an interview with ard public television . " but on the other hand , we obviously have to find a way to ensure that dangerous substances are recognized , be they solid or liquid explosives , so that materials that are n't picked up by a metal detector ca n't be smuggled on board , " he added . gisela piltz , deputy chairperson of the free democrats parliamentary party , said a device that did not reveal the private areas of a passenger 's body was the right way to find a balance between privacy and security . " if people 's dignity is to be preserved , then we should invest in this kind of a system for the security of the passengers , " piltz said in an interview with the daily newspaper rheinische post .
the white house responds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says the us will use all its resources to find those responsible meanwhile , us president barack obama has vowed to track down everyone responsible in plotting an attempted terrorist attack on an american airliner on christmas day .
speaking from hawaii on monday , obama pledged that his administration " will not rest until we find all who were involved and hold them accountable . " while al-qaeda was not specifically mentioned by obama , the group has claimed responsibility in a statement for the december 25 actions of nigerian umar farouk abdulmutallab.the 23-year-old man was charged by us authorities with attempting to blow up a northwest airlines plane en route to detroit from amsterdam with almost 300 people on board . officials say abdulmutallab met with al-qaeda operatives in yemen , where he acquired the bomb and was taught how to use it . in its statement , al-qaeda wrote that a " technical fault " caused the failure of the bomb to detonate , but said abdulmutallab 's act " dealt a huge blow to the myth of american and global intelligence services and showed how fragile its structure is . " us defenses to be tightened obama made it clear in his address that the united states would use all of its resources to combat future threats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry that full-body scanners reveal too much " we will continue to use every element of our national power to disrupt , to dismantle and defeat the violent extremists who threaten us , whether they are from afghanistan or pakistan , yemen or somalia , or anywhere where they are plotting attacks against the us homeland , " he said . the president also addressed the fact that abdulmutallab was still allowed to travel to the us despite his father 's warnings to american authorities of his extremist views , saying that a thorough review of the screening process has been ordered . " we need to determine just how the suspect was able to bring dangerous explosives aboard an aircraft and what additional steps we can take to thwart future attacks , " obama said . dutch in favor of new microwave detectors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch airport officials say they will make microwave scanners mandatory in the netherlands , airport authorities say they will make microwave scanners mandatory after the attempted attack . ad rutten , the chief operating officer of schiphol group , told reporters the airport would introduce the more sensitive detectors once they are approved by european authorities . although the microwave scanners are not as powerful as see-through full-body scanners , they can spot unusual objects hidden under clothing or on a person 's body .
the scanners are expected to be fully implemented in the country within a year. mz / mk / mrh / dpa / apd / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian oil company transneft earlier accused ukraine of setting " unacceptable " terms for oil transit .

" it 's about a bilateral dispute between two countries who are not eu members but who are vitally important for slovakia and a few other eu nations when it comes to energy supplies . "
he said his country had received a letter warning of an " increased risk " over oil shortages and that hungary , slovakia and the czech republic would be hit hardest .
hungary 's energy ministry on monday confirmed that budapest had also been informed of russia 's warning over oil shortages from january 1 .

“ the attempted attack is not a reason for us to change the security laws , ” said bosbach .
he said that in recent years many loopholes in security had been closed , but that legislation could not eliminate human error .
bosbach said , however , that european union plans to relax certain restrictions , such as on bringing liquids onto aircraft , should probably be put on hold .
speaking to the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , he said “ the searches we have now are not a result of security hysteria , rather a necessary step . ”
a key opposition figure , the green party 's hans-christian stroebele , echoed bosbach 's assessment .
he said that last week 's attempted attack was made possible by a failure to correctly assess existing intelligence , not a lack of security .
germany wary of stepping up security the failed bomber , umar farouk abdulmutallab , was on a us watch list of people with extremist ties , and his father , a prominent nigerian banker , had contacted us authorities to say that his son may have travelled to yemen to meet with islamists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police presence at german airports has become more visible since the attempted bombing of the transatlantic flight , security has been stepped up at german airports , using the means already at the authorities ' disposal .
over the weekend , germany 's federal police warned passengers that they could expect longer waits to get through airport security .
but experts remain divided over using more intrusive search methods at airports like the much-debated full-body or " nude " scanner .
the head of a german police union , rainer wendt , said it would be a mistake to use the technology .
that device would allow security personnel to observe a computer-generated reproduction of the contours of a passenger 's body , where well-hidden weapons or explosives might be visible .
that would go “ too far ” in invading people 's privacy , he told the berliner zeitung , and called instead for a heightened police presence at german airports .
holland in favor of new , microwave detectors but on monday , dutch airport authorities said they would make new , microwave scanners mandatory after the attempted attack .
ad rutten , the chief operating officer of schiphol group , told a news conference the airport would introduce the more sensitive detectors pending approval from european authorities . the microwave scanners are not as powerful as the see-through full-body scanners that allow security staff to see passengers virtually naked and detect items swallowed or concealed inside the body .
but they can spot unusual objects on the body and hidden under clothing . ron louwerse , security director for schiphol group , said he was confident the new microwave scanners would get eu approval . " the machine so far gave indications of the body shape and it was also possible to detect whether it was a man or a woman .
this violated certain privacy rules .
we 've now made some changes and we think this will get approval from european authorities , " he said . louwerse added that schipol airport could probably fully implement the new scanners within a year . mrh / sp / dpa / apd editor : chuck penfold / susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but back at home , the families and the partners of troops serving abroad also suffer . the families and partners of soldiers despatched to international conflict zones must often live with the very real fear their loved ones may not come home .
and so the military chaplaincy of the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , has launched a project to help families cope with the pressure this puts on their lives and relationships .
more than 7,000 german soldiers are currently serving on overseas missions , more than half of them in afghanistan .
in that country , the german troops are stationed in the relatively quiet north but that does n't mean they 're safe .
so far , 40 german soldiers and members of the police force have lost their lives .
the priests who accompany the german troops say this can also place a huge emotional burden on soldiers ' families back home .
for this reason , the catholic military bishopric has started a new program to help prepare families for the stresses of seeing loved ones sent away to conflict zones .
a helping hand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military chaplaincy wants the bundeswehr to do more for soldiers ' families and partners the project 's leader , peter wendl , says part of the task involves talking with military priests and couples who have already experienced foreign assignments .
he says a part of the problem is that couples often do n't talk about how they feel when one of them is sent away .
" throughout the interviews , it seemed that the fears of one partner or the other were n't articulated because they were incapable of expressing them or too insecure or because they felt helpless , " he says , " which naturally affected their relationships and their family life . "
wendl says that the fears a soldier experiences when on a dangerous patrol must be aired , and so should the fears a husband or wife back in germany may have that they could lose their partner and end up having to raise their children alone .
" we find that couples feel unbelievable relief when they get help in our seminars , and when they are given the chance to articulate their fears , " he says .
wendl has developed a training plan for the military chaplaincy which he hopes will make couples better able to cope with the stresses of foreign assignment .
the plan includes a step-by-step guide to the types of situations and crises they might go through during missions .
but wendl warns that the church is unable to do all the work for couples and families .
he says the best way to safeguard emotional wellbeing is to stay positive about the mission , and remain committed .
the burden of uncertainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are frequently targeted by insurgency attacks military dean monsignor rainer schadt has been accompanying german soldiers to crisis regions around the world since 1992 .
when it comes to germany 's current mission in afghanistan , he says military chaplains are witnessing a new challenge .
" increasingly we 're seeing not only experienced troops returning home , but also troops that have seen combat , " he says .
" this means we have another field to plough .
soldiers return home without having sustained injuries themselves , but rather have had to injure , and sometimes even kill , others in carrying out their duties .
" how families and soldiers deal with this phenomenon back at home is going to be a big part of our work in the future , " he adds .
the fear of knowing that a loved one is an enemy target can be an overwhelming burden , says this woman , whose partner served with the bundeswehr on three tours of duty abroad .
" i was afraid of what could happen , what could happen to him - the possibility that he may come back a different person from who he was when he left .
the fact that he could lose a leg or an arm , or be killed .
of course , these are the fears we have , " she says .

“ the attempted attack is not a reason for us to change the security laws , ” said bosbach .
he said that in recent years many loopholes in security had been closed , but that legislation could not eliminate human error .
bosbach said , however , that european union plans to relax certain restrictions , such as on bringing liquids onto aircraft , should probably be put on hold .
speaking to the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , he said “ the searches we have now are not a result of security hysteria , rather a necessary step . ”
a key opposition figure , the green party 's hans-christian stroebele , echoed bosbach 's assessment .
he said that last week 's attempted attack was made possible by a failure to correctly assess existing intelligence , not a lack of security .
germany wary of stepping up security the failed bomber , umar farouk abdulmutallab , was on a us watch list of people with extremist ties , and his father , a prominent nigerian banker , had contacted us authorities to say that his son may have travelled to yemen to meet with islamists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police presence at german airports has become more visible since the attempted bombing of the transatlantic flight , security has been stepped up at german airports , using the means already at the authorities ' disposal .
over the weekend , germany 's federal police warned passengers that they could expect longer waits to get through airport security .
but experts remain divided over using more intrusive search methods at airports like the much-debated full-body or " nude " scanner .
the head of a german police union , rainer wendt , said it would be a mistake to use the technology .
that device would allow security personnel to observe a computer-generated reproduction of the contours of a passenger 's body , where well-hidden weapons or explosives might be visible .
that would go “ too far ” in invading people 's privacy , he told the berliner zeitung , and called instead for a heightened police presence at german airports .
holland in favor of new , microwave detectors but on monday , dutch airport authorities said they would make new , microwave scanners mandatory after the attempted attack .
ad rutten , the chief operating officer of schiphol group , told a news conference the airport would introduce the more sensitive detectors pending approval from european authorities . the microwave scanners are not as powerful as the see-through full-body scanners that allow security staff to see passengers virtually naked and detect items swallowed or concealed inside the body .
but they can spot unusual objects on the body and hidden under clothing . ron louwerse , security director for schiphol group , said he was confident the new microwave scanners would get eu approval . " the machine so far gave indications of the body shape and it was also possible to detect whether it was a man or a woman .
this violated certain privacy rules .
we 've now made some changes and we think this will get approval from european authorities , " he said . louwerse added that schipol airport could probably fully implement the new scanners within a year . mrh / sp / dpa / apd editor : chuck penfold / susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but back at home , the families and the partners of troops serving abroad also suffer . the families and partners of soldiers despatched to international conflict zones must often live with the very real fear their loved ones may not come home .
and so the military chaplaincy of the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , has launched a project to help families cope with the pressure this puts on their lives and relationships .
more than 7,000 german soldiers are currently serving on overseas missions , more than half of them in afghanistan .
in that country , the german troops are stationed in the relatively quiet north but that does n't mean they 're safe .
so far , 40 german soldiers and members of the police force have lost their lives .
the priests who accompany the german troops say this can also place a huge emotional burden on soldiers ' families back home .
for this reason , the catholic military bishopric has started a new program to help prepare families for the stresses of seeing loved ones sent away to conflict zones .
a helping hand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military chaplaincy wants the bundeswehr to do more for soldiers ' families and partners the project 's leader , peter wendl , says part of the task involves talking with military priests and couples who have already experienced foreign assignments .
he says a part of the problem is that couples often do n't talk about how they feel when one of them is sent away .
" throughout the interviews , it seemed that the fears of one partner or the other were n't articulated because they were incapable of expressing them or too insecure or because they felt helpless , " he says , " which naturally affected their relationships and their family life . "
wendl says that the fears a soldier experiences when on a dangerous patrol must be aired , and so should the fears a husband or wife back in germany may have that they could lose their partner and end up having to raise their children alone .
" we find that couples feel unbelievable relief when they get help in our seminars , and when they are given the chance to articulate their fears , " he says .
wendl has developed a training plan for the military chaplaincy which he hopes will make couples better able to cope with the stresses of foreign assignment .
the plan includes a step-by-step guide to the types of situations and crises they might go through during missions .
but wendl warns that the church is unable to do all the work for couples and families .
he says the best way to safeguard emotional wellbeing is to stay positive about the mission , and remain committed .
the burden of uncertainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are frequently targeted by insurgency attacks military dean monsignor rainer schadt has been accompanying german soldiers to crisis regions around the world since 1992 .
when it comes to germany 's current mission in afghanistan , he says military chaplains are witnessing a new challenge .
" increasingly we 're seeing not only experienced troops returning home , but also troops that have seen combat , " he says .
" this means we have another field to plough .
soldiers return home without having sustained injuries themselves , but rather have had to injure , and sometimes even kill , others in carrying out their duties .
" how families and soldiers deal with this phenomenon back at home is going to be a big part of our work in the future , " he adds .
the fear of knowing that a loved one is an enemy target can be an overwhelming burden , says this woman , whose partner served with the bundeswehr on three tours of duty abroad .
" i was afraid of what could happen , what could happen to him - the possibility that he may come back a different person from who he was when he left .
the fact that he could lose a leg or an arm , or be killed .
of course , these are the fears we have , " she says .

future berlinale festivals may look very different as change sweeps the film industry and the red carpet gets greener . star director martin scorsese , actor leonardo dicaprio and indian superstar shah rukh khan are among those slated to light up the red carpet in berlin this winter .
they will take part in the 60th annual berlinale film festival from february 11 to 21 . some guests have been unable to confirm their appearance , such as the embattled director roman polanski whose film " the ghost writer " is scheduled to be screened at the festival .
the 76-year-old director is still under house arrest at his chalet in switzerland during his battle to avoid extradition to the united states over a case of statutory rape in 1977 . but dieter kosslick , head of the berlinale festival , is sure there will be enough star power to go around .
" if just the stars from the nominated films come , the red carpet is sure to be full , " he said . " happy bears-day berlinale " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter kosslick sees interesting changes ahead for the film industry the festival 's motto - " happy bears-day berlinale ! " - pays homage to the official symbol of the city of berlin , the bear , that also appears on its coat of arms .
the producer of the film that wins the highest honors at the festival will be awarded the golden bear trophy .
during the festival , kosslick hopes to shed light on the history of the berlinale , but he is also planning to preview some technological changes that are in store for the awards show .
" the keyword is digitalization .
the whole film industry is embracing this kind of change , " he said .
in the future , films may be digitally projected by special satellites , and 3-d films may even be in the running at the berlinale in the coming years .
" run if you can " the film opening the festivities will be " renn , wenn du kannst " or " run if you can " by director dietrich brueggemann .
the film will also introduce an ongoing series investigating the perspective of german cinema .
brueggemann developed the script together with his sister , anna brueggemann , who also took on a leading role in the film .
actors robert gwisdek and jacob matschenz also play major parts in " run if you can . "
the film tells the story of a young man in a wheelchair who has doubts about his first love .
brueggemann , who graduated from the academy of film and television in potsdam-babelsberg , was already a guest at the berlinale in 2006 for " neun szenen " or " nine scenes . "
bio-berlinale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentally friendly changes await this year 's red carpet the 60th berlinale will highlight another concern : the environment .
kosslick has ensured that environmentally friendly cars will be used to transport stars to the event , limited amounts of paper will be used , and low voltage lighting will illuminate the red carpet .
" we ca n't just show films that set out to make the world better and then do nothing about the problems ourselves , " kosslick explained . author : sabine oelze / dpa / ap -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nephew of opposition leader mir hossein mousavi is reported to be among the dead . iranian state television has reported that eight people were killed in violent clashes between police and opposition supporters during rituals commemorating one of shiite islam 's leading figures on sunday .
the state english-language press tv confirmed the deaths , citing iran ’ s supreme national security council .
as many as 300 demonstrators were arrested following the clashes , and reports said that ali riza beheshti , the closest aide to opposition leader mir hossein mousavi , and former foreign minister ebrahim yazdi were also detained early on monday .
the deaths were the first such fatalities in the country since violent street protests erupted there following the disputed re-election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad in june , which saw as many as 70 people die .
according to the web site kaleme , an adviser to mousavi confirmed the death of mousavi 's nephew in the clashes .
the web site quoted the adviser as saying , " i express my regrets and deep condolences over the martyrdom of your nephew ali habibi mousavi on sunday . "
bildunterschrift : police reportedly detained hundreds of opposition supporters iranian , international outcry among eu nations , france has been the first to criticize the iranian government 's response .
" france condemns the arbitrary arrests and the violent actions committed against simple protesters who came to defend their right to freedom of expression and their desire for democracy , " the french foreign ministry said in a statement .
dissident cleric mehdi karroubi on monday also condemned the killings , commenting that even the country ’ s now-deposed shah respected the holy ashura ceremony .
" what has happened to this religious system that it orders the killing of innocent people during the holy day of ashura ? " asked karoubi , who came fourth in the june election , in a statement posted on the jaras web site . exiled iranian opposition figure mehran barati , who now resides in germany , said continuing public opposition to the iranian government would increasingly lead to " cracks in the ruling apparatus , " and would galvanize support for mir hossein mousavi , who he referred to as the " hope bearer " for anti-ahmadinejad forces . clashes reported across iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions have risen since the death of dissident cleric montazeri tens of thousands of demonstrators are said to be on the streets of tehran with clashes also in other cities , among them shiraz , isfahan and najafabad . on saturday , riot police used tear gas and shot into the air to disperse crowds of protesters in the city .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 28.12.2009 the church reaches out to the families of german troops abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seeing a loved one leave for a conflict zone can be distressing soldiers often have to endure tough conditions when on foreign tour .
but back at home , the families and the partners of troops serving abroad also suffer . the families and partners of soldiers despatched to international conflict zones must often live with the very real fear their loved ones may not come home .
and so the military chaplaincy of the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , has launched a project to help families cope with the pressure this puts on their lives and relationships .
more than 7,000 german soldiers are currently serving on overseas missions , more than half of them in afghanistan .
in that country , the german troops are stationed in the relatively quiet north but that does n't mean they 're safe .
so far , 40 german soldiers and members of the police force have lost their lives .
the priests who accompany the german troops say this can also place a huge emotional burden on soldiers ' families back home .
for this reason , the catholic military bishopric has started a new program to help prepare families for the stresses of seeing loved ones sent away to conflict zones .
a helping hand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military chaplaincy wants the bundeswehr to do more for soldiers ' families and partners the project 's leader , peter wendl , says part of the task involves talking with military priests and couples who have already experienced foreign assignments .
he says a part of the problem is that couples often do n't talk about how they feel when one of them is sent away .
" throughout the interviews , it seemed that the fears of one partner or the other were n't articulated because they were incapable of expressing them or too insecure or because they felt helpless , " he says , " which naturally affected their relationships and their family life . "
wendl says that the fears a soldier experiences when on a dangerous patrol must be aired , and so should the fears a husband or wife back in germany may have that they could lose their partner and end up having to raise their children alone .
" we find that couples feel unbelievable relief when they get help in our seminars , and when they are given the chance to articulate their fears , " he says .
wendl has developed a training plan for the military chaplaincy which he hopes will make couples better able to cope with the stresses of foreign assignment .
the plan includes a step-by-step guide to the types of situations and crises they might go through during missions .
but wendl warns that the church is unable to do all the work for couples and families .
he says the best way to safeguard emotional wellbeing is to stay positive about the mission , and remain committed .
the burden of uncertainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are frequently targeted by insurgency attacks military dean monsignor rainer schadt has been accompanying german soldiers to crisis regions around the world since 1992 .
when it comes to germany 's current mission in afghanistan , he says military chaplains are witnessing a new challenge .
" increasingly we 're seeing not only experienced troops returning home , but also troops that have seen combat , " he says .
" this means we have another field to plough .
soldiers return home without having sustained injuries themselves , but rather have had to injure , and sometimes even kill , others in carrying out their duties .
" how families and soldiers deal with this phenomenon back at home is going to be a big part of our work in the future , " he adds .
the fear of knowing that a loved one is an enemy target can be an overwhelming burden , says this woman , whose partner served with the bundeswehr on three tours of duty abroad .
" i was afraid of what could happen , what could happen to him - the possibility that he may come back a different person from who he was when he left .
the fact that he could lose a leg or an arm , or be killed .
of course , these are the fears we have , " she says .

the eu said it was illegal under international law to construct further settlements on occupied palestinian land . " the presidency of the european union is dismayed at the announcement of the government of israel to build nearly 700 apartments in occupied east jerusalem , " said a statement from sweden , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
earlier on monday , israel had announced plans to build almost 700 new apartments in occupied east jerusalem .
the new homes will be located in areas which israel captured in the 1967 middle east war .
" settlements on occupied land are illegal under international law , " the eu statement said .
" the presidency of the european union thus urges the government of israel to reconsider these plans . "
the new settlement plans have already prompted strong protests from the palestinian side .
president mahmoud abbas has refused to resume peace talks without a complete israeli halt to settlement construction in east jerusalem .
the palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of their future state while israel claims both east and west jerusalem as part of its " eternal , indivisible " capital .
palestinians call on us for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas has his hopes pinned on international support from the us and the eu chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat warned the development " further sabotaged international efforts to resume permanent status negotiations . "
erekat called on the us to clarify its position on israel 's obligation to freeze all settlement construction as agreed under the 2003 road map peace plan .
later on monday , white house spokesman robert gibbs said the united states " opposes new israeli construction in east jerusalem . "
around 500,000 israelis live in settlements in east jerusalem and the west bank deemed illegal under international law .
israel 's capture and annexation of the territory during the middle east war 1967 was never recognized by the international community .
the continued expansion of settlements - especially in east jerusalem - is seen as one of the major obstacles to peace talks between israelis and palestinians. ai / dpa / afpe editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.12.2009 dax stock index breaches 6,000-point mark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 6,000-point barrier has been a major psychological hurdle for german investors the german dax index of leading stocks broke through the 6,000 point barrier on monday - the first time it has reached the benchmark since september 26 , 2008 . the index opened at 5,977.99 points , a gain of 0.34 percent from wednesday 's pre-christmas close , and hit the 6,000-point mark in early trade .
after hovering both above and below that level throughout the day , it closed at 6,003 points .
" this is a psychological victory , " baader bank market analyst robert halver told dpa news agency .
" the breach of the 6,000 barrier is certainly a positive signal . "
the dax index stood at 6234 points in mid-september 2008 , before the collapse of the us-based lehman brothers investment bank triggered chaos on world financial markets ..
by march 2009 the dax had dropped to around 3,600 points , its lowest level since 2003 .
but some traders warned that low trading volumes meant recent gains should not be overvalued .
dow jones newswires quoted a deutsche bank trader as saying that trading volumes were expected to remain thin until the end of the year , and cited positive sentiment on asian markets and us movements on friday as reasons for the breakthrough .
in new york , traders were reportedly set to close 2009 on a high note , with markets expected to hold on to solid gains after staging a remarkable turnaround from a chaotic start to the year. sje / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 28.12.2009 thailand deports hmong refugees to laos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai troops surround houses in the hmong refugee camp during the deportation on monday on monday , thailand began the deportation of thousands of lao hmong asylum seekers despite international protests calling for the operation to be suspended .
the thai government has denied all claims the lao hmong will face persecution once they are sent back . the operation to send the 4,000 lao hmong back across the border into laos began early monday under tight security after more than two days of preparations by thai authorities including a wide security perimeter to prevent outside access to the camp .
over 5,000 thai personnel and security had been sent to the camp in phetchabun province 370 kilometres north of bangkok , to process and deport the lao hmong who have lived in the camp over recent years .
government defends deportation thai government spokesman , panitan wattanayagorn , said the government ’ s decision had a sound legal basis .
" based on the immigration law of 1979 , we consider these people illegal immigrants " , panitan said .
" that ’ s why they have to be deported back .
we do this in good faith , in compliance with human rights standards and we have to make sure these people will be repatriated back in a safe and sound condition . "
during the vietnam war the lao hmong fought alongside the us and allied forces against the communist pathet lao .
after the communists took power in laos in 1975 , thousands fled largely to camps inside thailand .
many from the camps were resettled in countries such as the united states , canada , and australia .
" no force " international organizations such as the united nations and the united states have protested the move by the thai government .
the us state department accused thai authorities of forcibly returning the lao hmong .
the us urged the thai authorities to suspend the operation , calling it a " serious violation of international humanitarian principles " .
but panitan denied deportation was being forced on the lao hmong : " they volunteered to go back , at least on monday morning .
they have told the officers in-charge that they volunteer to go back . "
panitan said the lao authorities had promised those sent back would be granted an amnesty in laos .
he also said many of a group of 150 lao hmong refugees currently held at nong khai , the thai border town with laos , have been screened and would be eligible for asylum in a third country , largely expected to be the united states .
human rights groups concerned but us-based human rights watch said the thai government ’ s deportation of the lao hmong was in breach of international standards .
sunai pasuk , the group ’ s representative in thailand , said , " the deportation is carried out without proper screening .
so there is no guarantee at all that thailand is not sending people that deserve to be protected under international law back to laos .
in this regard this is a serious violation of international law and of human rights principles . "
the un refugee agency unhcr blames human traffickers for the lao hmong ’ s plight , also adding that many would qualify for asylum or refugee status if properly screened .

while the tone across the pond has changed drastically , on substance many disagreements remain between the two sides . when german chancellor angela merkel was one of the last major european leaders to have her first official white house visit with barack obama the media speculated that the personal chemistry between chancellor and president was n't right .
but just when it mattered most , the popular president came around for merkel .
with months to go before germany 's general election in september , obama told merkel during her visit to washington in june that he thought she had already won the contest , adding that he did n't understand why she worried so much about it .
the unusually frank exchange , captured by a german television crew , not only showed the two leaders getting along just fine , it also provided a welcome boost for merkel 's international stature back home from a president who was and still is more popular in germany than any national politician .
further proof of how highly merkel is regarded by the new president was her invitation to speak before both houses of congress .
the address to congress took place only weeks after the german election , but was scheduled months ago with the obvious assumption that merkel would be reelected . the good personal chemistry between president and chancellor and obama 's immense international popularity has smoothed over some quite profound differences on major topics .
afghanistan : starting with his famous speech in berlin as a presidential candidate , president obama has repeatedly made it clear that he unlike his predecessor will listen and take into account the advice and concerns of us allies on important international issues .
but he added that he also expected europe to make a fresh start in transatlantic relations and not only voice concerns , but help shape a positive solution to shared problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan the prime testing ground for this new approach is of course afghanistan .
but while the us under obama has made significant changes in its afghan strategy starting with the replacement of the isaf commander , a new focus on counterinsurgency and protection of civilians and a troop surge , germany 's stance remains pretty much the same .
berlin has all but ruled out deploying troops to the more dangerous southern part of the country and in fact is very reluctant to significantly increase its military contingent at all .
despite obama 's hope for a stronger german role in afghanistan , the new center-right government 's position is largely unchanged from that of the grand coalition during the presidency of george w. bush .
financial crisis : while germany and the us agree on the broad goal of mitigating the effects of the worst recession since the 1930s and reforming the global financial system , berlin and washington are not on the same page when it comes to how this can be accomplished .
the german government contends that the goal of stimulating the economy has to be balanced against fiscal responsibility .
for the us administration however , restarting the economy clearly trumps concerns about fiscal stability .
consequently , right after taking office obama repeatedly pushed hard for germany to increase its stimulus packages that the white house viewed as too small .
the same is true when it comes to reforming the financial sector .
to be sure , according to a recent analysis by bloomberg , not one measure that would overhaul the financial system has been put into action in europe or the us .
but while germany by requiring banks to improve their financial resilience has at least made a stab at reform , the us so far has n't .
there 's also great reluctance in the us to back european proposals to curb bankers ' bonuses , a move that would have little economic relevance , but huge public significance .
however , neither germany nor the us have made serious efforts to split up the so called too-big-to fail universal banks , a measure that is supported by experts like joseph stiglitz and paul volcker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has a tough time getting climate change through congress climate change : the new us administration by acknowledging the problem and by vowing to take an active role in combating climate change reversed the stance of bush presidency - at least in theory .
but as observers in germany have had to learn against the backdrop of the failed negotiations at the copenhagen climate conference , even an american president who supports european efforts to curb global warming can not by himself convince a reluctant congress to sign on to an international climate change treaty . so what then is the state of us-german relations in year one of the obama presidency ?
compared to the bush administration , the rhetoric and the tone in the transatlantic conversation improved dramatically under president obama .
as promised during his election campaign , he has tried to seriously consult and engage with germany and other european partners and focused on a multilateral approach .
for this he has been rewarded with strong approval ratings in germany and europe .
on substance , however , there is little change in transatlantic affairs .
when push comes to shove , when words need to be translated into action the current leaderships in the us and germany have not behaved very differently to those under the previous administrations .
that is true not just on afghanistan , the financial crisis and climate change , but also on other issues such as how to deal with the guantanamo prisoners .

while the tone across the pond has changed drastically , on substance many disagreements remain between the two sides . when german chancellor angela merkel was one of the last major european leaders to have her first official white house visit with barack obama the media speculated that the personal chemistry between chancellor and president was n't right .
but just when it mattered most , the popular president came around for merkel .
with months to go before germany 's general election in september , obama told merkel during her visit to washington in june that he thought she had already won the contest , adding that he did n't understand why she worried so much about it .
the unusually frank exchange , captured by a german television crew , not only showed the two leaders getting along just fine , it also provided a welcome boost for merkel 's international stature back home from a president who was and still is more popular in germany than any national politician .
further proof of how highly merkel is regarded by the new president was her invitation to speak before both houses of congress .
the address to congress took place only weeks after the german election , but was scheduled months ago with the obvious assumption that merkel would be reelected . the good personal chemistry between president and chancellor and obama 's immense international popularity has smoothed over some quite profound differences on major topics .
afghanistan : starting with his famous speech in berlin as a presidential candidate , president obama has repeatedly made it clear that he unlike his predecessor will listen and take into account the advice and concerns of us allies on important international issues .
but he added that he also expected europe to make a fresh start in transatlantic relations and not only voice concerns , but help shape a positive solution to shared problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan the prime testing ground for this new approach is of course afghanistan .
but while the us under obama has made significant changes in its afghan strategy starting with the replacement of the isaf commander , a new focus on counterinsurgency and protection of civilians and a troop surge , germany 's stance remains pretty much the same .
berlin has all but ruled out deploying troops to the more dangerous southern part of the country and in fact is very reluctant to significantly increase its military contingent at all .
despite obama 's hope for a stronger german role in afghanistan , the new center-right government 's position is largely unchanged from that of the grand coalition during the presidency of george w. bush .
financial crisis : while germany and the us agree on the broad goal of mitigating the effects of the worst recession since the 1930s and reforming the global financial system , berlin and washington are not on the same page when it comes to how this can be accomplished .
the german government contends that the goal of stimulating the economy has to be balanced against fiscal responsibility .
for the us administration however , restarting the economy clearly trumps concerns about fiscal stability .
consequently , right after taking office obama repeatedly pushed hard for germany to increase its stimulus packages that the white house viewed as too small .
the same is true when it comes to reforming the financial sector .
to be sure , according to a recent analysis by bloomberg , not one measure that would overhaul the financial system has been put into action in europe or the us .
but while germany by requiring banks to improve their financial resilience has at least made a stab at reform , the us so far has n't .
there 's also great reluctance in the us to back european proposals to curb bankers ' bonuses , a move that would have little economic relevance , but huge public significance .
however , neither germany nor the us have made serious efforts to split up the so called too-big-to fail universal banks , a measure that is supported by experts like joseph stiglitz and paul volcker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has a tough time getting climate change through congress climate change : the new us administration by acknowledging the problem and by vowing to take an active role in combating climate change reversed the stance of bush presidency - at least in theory .
but as observers in germany have had to learn against the backdrop of the failed negotiations at the copenhagen climate conference , even an american president who supports european efforts to curb global warming can not by himself convince a reluctant congress to sign on to an international climate change treaty . so what then is the state of us-german relations in year one of the obama presidency ?
compared to the bush administration , the rhetoric and the tone in the transatlantic conversation improved dramatically under president obama .
as promised during his election campaign , he has tried to seriously consult and engage with germany and other european partners and focused on a multilateral approach .
for this he has been rewarded with strong approval ratings in germany and europe .
on substance , however , there is little change in transatlantic affairs .
when push comes to shove , when words need to be translated into action the current leaderships in the us and germany have not behaved very differently to those under the previous administrations .
that is true not just on afghanistan , the financial crisis and climate change , but also on other issues such as how to deal with the guantanamo prisoners .

while the tone across the pond has changed drastically , on substance many disagreements remain between the two sides . when german chancellor angela merkel was one of the last major european leaders to have her first official white house visit with barack obama the media speculated that the personal chemistry between chancellor and president was n't right .
but just when it mattered most , the popular president came around for merkel .
with months to go before germany 's general election in september , obama told merkel during her visit to washington in june that he thought she had already won the contest , adding that he did n't understand why she worried so much about it .
the unusually frank exchange , captured by a german television crew , not only showed the two leaders getting along just fine , it also provided a welcome boost for merkel 's international stature back home from a president who was and still is more popular in germany than any national politician .
further proof of how highly merkel is regarded by the new president was her invitation to speak before both houses of congress .
the address to congress took place only weeks after the german election , but was scheduled months ago with the obvious assumption that merkel would be reelected . the good personal chemistry between president and chancellor and obama 's immense international popularity has smoothed over some quite profound differences on major topics .
afghanistan : starting with his famous speech in berlin as a presidential candidate , president obama has repeatedly made it clear that he unlike his predecessor will listen and take into account the advice and concerns of us allies on important international issues .
but he added that he also expected europe to make a fresh start in transatlantic relations and not only voice concerns , but help shape a positive solution to shared problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan the prime testing ground for this new approach is of course afghanistan .
but while the us under obama has made significant changes in its afghan strategy starting with the replacement of the isaf commander , a new focus on counterinsurgency and protection of civilians and a troop surge , germany 's stance remains pretty much the same .
berlin has all but ruled out deploying troops to the more dangerous southern part of the country and in fact is very reluctant to significantly increase its military contingent at all .
despite obama 's hope for a stronger german role in afghanistan , the new center-right government 's position is largely unchanged from that of the grand coalition during the presidency of george w. bush .
financial crisis : while germany and the us agree on the broad goal of mitigating the effects of the worst recession since the 1930s and reforming the global financial system , berlin and washington are not on the same page when it comes to how this can be accomplished .
the german government contends that the goal of stimulating the economy has to be balanced against fiscal responsibility .
for the us administration however , restarting the economy clearly trumps concerns about fiscal stability .
consequently , right after taking office obama repeatedly pushed hard for germany to increase its stimulus packages that the white house viewed as too small .
the same is true when it comes to reforming the financial sector .
to be sure , according to a recent analysis by bloomberg , not one measure that would overhaul the financial system has been put into action in europe or the us .
but while germany by requiring banks to improve their financial resilience has at least made a stab at reform , the us so far has n't .
there 's also great reluctance in the us to back european proposals to curb bankers ' bonuses , a move that would have little economic relevance , but huge public significance .
however , neither germany nor the us have made serious efforts to split up the so called too-big-to fail universal banks , a measure that is supported by experts like joseph stiglitz and paul volcker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has a tough time getting climate change through congress climate change : the new us administration by acknowledging the problem and by vowing to take an active role in combating climate change reversed the stance of bush presidency - at least in theory .
but as observers in germany have had to learn against the backdrop of the failed negotiations at the copenhagen climate conference , even an american president who supports european efforts to curb global warming can not by himself convince a reluctant congress to sign on to an international climate change treaty . so what then is the state of us-german relations in year one of the obama presidency ?
compared to the bush administration , the rhetoric and the tone in the transatlantic conversation improved dramatically under president obama .
as promised during his election campaign , he has tried to seriously consult and engage with germany and other european partners and focused on a multilateral approach .
for this he has been rewarded with strong approval ratings in germany and europe .
on substance , however , there is little change in transatlantic affairs .
when push comes to shove , when words need to be translated into action the current leaderships in the us and germany have not behaved very differently to those under the previous administrations .
that is true not just on afghanistan , the financial crisis and climate change , but also on other issues such as how to deal with the guantanamo prisoners .

but back at home , the families and the partners of troops serving abroad also suffer . the families and partners of soldiers despatched to international conflict zones must often live with the very real fear their loved ones may not come home .
and so the military chaplaincy of the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , has launched a project to help families cope with the pressure this puts on their lives and relationships .
more than 7,000 german soldiers are currently serving on overseas missions , more than half of them in afghanistan .
in that country , the german troops are stationed in the relatively quiet north but that does n't mean they 're safe .
so far , 40 german soldiers and members of the police force have lost their lives .
the priests who accompany the german troops say this can also place a huge emotional burden on soldiers ' families back home .
for this reason , the catholic military bishopric has started a new program to help prepare families for the stresses of seeing loved ones sent away to conflict zones .
a helping hand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military chaplaincy wants the bundeswehr to do more for soldiers ' families and partners the project 's leader , peter wendl , says part of the task involves talking with military priests and couples who have already experienced foreign assignments .
he says a part of the problem is that couples often do n't talk about how they feel when one of them is sent away .
" throughout the interviews , it seemed that the fears of one partner or the other were n't articulated because they were incapable of expressing them or too insecure or because they felt helpless , " he says , " which naturally affected their relationships and their family life . "
wendl says that the fears a soldier experiences when on a dangerous patrol must be aired , and so should the fears a husband or wife back in germany may have that they could lose their partner and end up having to raise their children alone .
" we find that couples feel unbelievable relief when they get help in our seminars , and when they are given the chance to articulate their fears , " he says .
wendl has developed a training plan for the military chaplaincy which he hopes will make couples better able to cope with the stresses of foreign assignment .
the plan includes a step-by-step guide to the types of situations and crises they might go through during missions .
but wendl warns that the church is unable to do all the work for couples and families .
he says the best way to safeguard emotional wellbeing is to stay positive about the mission , and remain committed .
the burden of uncertainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are frequently targeted by insurgency attacks military dean monsignor rainer schadt has been accompanying german soldiers to crisis regions around the world since 1992 .
when it comes to germany 's current mission in afghanistan , he says military chaplains are witnessing a new challenge .
" increasingly we 're seeing not only experienced troops returning home , but also troops that have seen combat , " he says .
" this means we have another field to plough .
soldiers return home without having sustained injuries themselves , but rather have had to injure , and sometimes even kill , others in carrying out their duties .
" how families and soldiers deal with this phenomenon back at home is going to be a big part of our work in the future , " he adds .
the fear of knowing that a loved one is an enemy target can be an overwhelming burden , says this woman , whose partner served with the bundeswehr on three tours of duty abroad .
" i was afraid of what could happen , what could happen to him - the possibility that he may come back a different person from who he was when he left .
the fact that he could lose a leg or an arm , or be killed .
of course , these are the fears we have , " she says .

" throughout the interviews , it seemed that the fears of one partner or the other were n't articulated because they were incapable of expressing them or too insecure or because they felt helpless , " he says , " which naturally affected their relationships and their family life . "
wendl says that the fears a soldier experiences when on a dangerous patrol must be aired , and so should the fears a husband or wife back in germany may have that they could lose their partner and end up having to raise their children alone .
" we find that couples feel unbelievable relief when they get help in our seminars , and when they are given the chance to articulate their fears , " he says .
wendl has developed a training plan for the military chaplaincy which he hopes will make couples better able to cope with the stresses of foreign assignment .
the plan includes a step-by-step guide to the types of situations and crises they might go through during missions .
but wendl warns that the church is unable to do all the work for couples and families .
he says the best way to safeguard emotional wellbeing is to stay positive about the mission , and remain committed .
the burden of uncertainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are frequently targeted by insurgency attacks military dean monsignor rainer schadt has been accompanying german soldiers to crisis regions around the world since 1992 .
when it comes to germany 's current mission in afghanistan , he says military chaplains are witnessing a new challenge .
" increasingly we 're seeing not only experienced troops returning home , but also troops that have seen combat , " he says .
" this means we have another field to plough .
soldiers return home without having sustained injuries themselves , but rather have had to injure , and sometimes even kill , others in carrying out their duties .
" how families and soldiers deal with this phenomenon back at home is going to be a big part of our work in the future , " he adds .
the fear of knowing that a loved one is an enemy target can be an overwhelming burden , says this woman , whose partner served with the bundeswehr on three tours of duty abroad .
" i was afraid of what could happen , what could happen to him - the possibility that he may come back a different person from who he was when he left .
the fact that he could lose a leg or an arm , or be killed .
of course , these are the fears we have , " she says .

but back at home , the families and the partners of troops serving abroad also suffer . the families and partners of soldiers despatched to international conflict zones must often live with the very real fear their loved ones may not come home .
and so the military chaplaincy of the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , has launched a project to help families cope with the pressure this puts on their lives and relationships .
more than 7,000 german soldiers are currently serving on overseas missions , more than half of them in afghanistan .
in that country , the german troops are stationed in the relatively quiet north but that does n't mean they 're safe .
so far , 40 german soldiers and members of the police force have lost their lives .
the priests who accompany the german troops say this can also place a huge emotional burden on soldiers ' families back home .
for this reason , the catholic military bishopric has started a new program to help prepare families for the stresses of seeing loved ones sent away to conflict zones .
a helping hand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military chaplaincy wants the bundeswehr to do more for soldiers ' families and partners the project 's leader , peter wendl , says part of the task involves talking with military priests and couples who have already experienced foreign assignments .
he says a part of the problem is that couples often do n't talk about how they feel when one of them is sent away .
" throughout the interviews , it seemed that the fears of one partner or the other were n't articulated because they were incapable of expressing them or too insecure or because they felt helpless , " he says , " which naturally affected their relationships and their family life . "
wendl says that the fears a soldier experiences when on a dangerous patrol must be aired , and so should the fears a husband or wife back in germany may have that they could lose their partner and end up having to raise their children alone .
" we find that couples feel unbelievable relief when they get help in our seminars , and when they are given the chance to articulate their fears , " he says .
wendl has developed a training plan for the military chaplaincy which he hopes will make couples better able to cope with the stresses of foreign assignment .
the plan includes a step-by-step guide to the types of situations and crises they might go through during missions .
but wendl warns that the church is unable to do all the work for couples and families .
he says the best way to safeguard emotional wellbeing is to stay positive about the mission , and remain committed .
the burden of uncertainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are frequently targeted by insurgency attacks military dean monsignor rainer schadt has been accompanying german soldiers to crisis regions around the world since 1992 .
when it comes to germany 's current mission in afghanistan , he says military chaplains are witnessing a new challenge .
" increasingly we 're seeing not only experienced troops returning home , but also troops that have seen combat , " he says .
" this means we have another field to plough .
soldiers return home without having sustained injuries themselves , but rather have had to injure , and sometimes even kill , others in carrying out their duties .
" how families and soldiers deal with this phenomenon back at home is going to be a big part of our work in the future , " he adds .
the fear of knowing that a loved one is an enemy target can be an overwhelming burden , says this woman , whose partner served with the bundeswehr on three tours of duty abroad .
" i was afraid of what could happen , what could happen to him - the possibility that he may come back a different person from who he was when he left .
the fact that he could lose a leg or an arm , or be killed .
of course , these are the fears we have , " she says .

the nephew of opposition leader mir hossein mousavi is reported to be among the dead . iranian state television has reported that eight people were killed in violent clashes between police and opposition supporters during rituals commemorating one of shiite islam 's leading figures on sunday .
the state english-language press tv confirmed the deaths , citing iran ’ s supreme national security council .
as many as 300 demonstrators were arrested following the clashes , and reports said that ali riza beheshti , the closest aide to opposition leader mir hossein mousavi , and former foreign minister ebrahim yazdi were also detained early on monday .
the deaths were the first such fatalities in the country since violent street protests erupted there following the disputed re-election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad in june , which saw as many as 70 people die .
according to the web site kaleme , an adviser to mousavi confirmed the death of mousavi 's nephew in the clashes .
the web site quoted the adviser as saying , " i express my regrets and deep condolences over the martyrdom of your nephew ali habibi mousavi on sunday . "

dissident cleric mehdi karroubi on monday also condemned the killings , commenting that even the country ’ s now-deposed shah respected the holy ashura ceremony .

" asked karoubi , who came fourth in the june election , in a statement posted on the jaras web site . exiled iranian opposition figure mehran barati , who now resides in germany , said continuing public opposition to the iranian government would increasingly lead to " cracks in the ruling apparatus , " and would galvanize support for mir hossein mousavi , who he referred to as the " hope bearer " for anti-ahmadinejad forces . clashes reported across iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions have risen since the death of dissident cleric montazeri tens of thousands of demonstrators are said to be on the streets of tehran with clashes also in other cities , among them shiraz , isfahan and najafabad . on saturday , riot police used tear gas and shot into the air to disperse crowds of protesters in the city .

the state english-language press tv confirmed the deaths , citing iran ’ s supreme national security council .
as many as 300 demonstrators were arrested following the clashes , and reports said that ali riza beheshti , the closest aide to opposition leader mir hossein mousavi , and former foreign minister ebrahim yazdi were also detained early on monday .
the deaths were the first such fatalities in the country since violent street protests erupted there following the disputed re-election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad in june , which saw as many as 70 people die .
according to the web site kaleme , an adviser to mousavi confirmed the death of mousavi 's nephew in the clashes .

the german wikipedia site is celebrating its landmark millionth article after more than eight years of operation . the german version of the free online encyclopedia wikipedia passed a significant hurdle on sunday as it observed its one millionth entry .
the landmark article was about the american botanist ernie wasson .
some in the wikipedia community felt , however , that this topic was too insignificant and nominated it for deletion .
if that should come to pass , then an article about german speed skater robert seifert would take the honor of being the site 's one millionth article .
looking ahead the first german wikipedia article was written by biochemist magnus manske in may 2001 .
it described the so-called polymerase chain reaction , which duplicates dna in a test tube .
the german site is expecting to reach its next milestone , its two millionth entry , sometime in 2015 .
the german wiki , a collection of hyperlinked , publicly edited encyclopedic articles , is surpassed in size only by the english version , which has more than three million .
after german , the french wikipedia page has the third most entries at more than 890,000 , followed by the polish and then italian pages with 662,000 and 642,000 respectively .
across all languages there are more than 13 million wikipedia articles in more than 250 languages , according to the wikimedia foundation. sjt / dpa / glp editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kyiv , however , says the dispute will not affect oil transits to the eu . russia has informed the eu that slovakia , the czech republic and hungary might be affected by a cut in russian oil supplies , slovakian prime minister robert fico said on monday .
russian oil company transneft earlier accused ukraine of setting " unacceptable " terms for oil transit .
kyiv downplayed the tensions , saying that russia 's warning to the eu was merely aimed at discrediting ukraine as a reliable transit country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : price disputes between moscow and kyiv have become an annual problem the renewed concerns come as the international monetary fund has rejected ukraine 's request for a 2 billion dollar loan to help the country meet obligations by the end of the year .
in recent years , price disputes between moscow and kyiv had repeatedly led to supply cuts which left millions of europeans in the cold .
hungary , slovakia and czech republic most hit " it 's not about a shortage of oil , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters on monday .
" it 's about a bilateral dispute between two countries who are not eu members but who are vitally important for slovakia and a few other eu nations when it comes to energy supplies . "
he said his country had received a letter warning of an " increased risk " over oil shortages and that hungary , slovakia and the czech republic would be hit hardest .
hungary 's energy ministry on monday confirmed that budapest had also been informed of russia 's warning over oil shortages from january 1 .
ukraine moved quickly to dispel any such concerns , saying that the eu had " no reasons to worry " about possible disruptions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom has downplayed worries over renewed shortages government spokesman bogdan sokolovsky said the ukrainian state energy company naftogaz was seeking higher transit fees merely so that they would reflect inflation and rising maintenance costs . russia 's transneft , however , has called the new terms for the oil transit via the ukrainian black sea port of yuzhny unacceptable .
" the process is continuing and i hope we will solve it before the new year , " transneft 's president nikolai tokarev said .
" but if they insist on their terms , we will also review the prospects of supplies . "
russia 's gas monopoly gazprom , however , said on monday there was no danger of a repeat of the gas rows with ukraine that had left parts of europe with drastic energy shortages in recent winters. ai / reuters / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de putin calls on eu to help ukraine with gas bill russian prime minister vladimir putin told the european union to " open its wallet " and help ukraine pay its gas bills on monday , intensifying fears of a repeat of last winter 's gas supply disruption .

moscow still seems determined to have a say in how things are run in kyiv .

but german politicians are n't quite ready for that much exposure in airports . full body scanners would allow security personnel to observe a computer-generated reproduction of the contours of a passenger 's body , where well-hidden weapons or explosives might be visible . in germany , critics of the devices say the scanners are too intrusive concerning passengers ' privacy , and have called for a solution that does not reveal as much of a person 's body . " we do n't want nude scanners where the contours of the passengers ' bodies are clearly depicted on a screen , and where we ca n't be sure if the passengers ' private parts are visible , " said wolfgang bosbach , chairman of the parliamentary internal affairs committee , in an interview with ard public television . " but on the other hand , we obviously have to find a way to ensure that dangerous substances are recognized , be they solid or liquid explosives , so that materials that are n't picked up by a metal detector ca n't be smuggled on board , " he added . gisela piltz , deputy chairperson of the free democrats parliamentary party , said a device that did not reveal the private areas of a passenger 's body was the right way to find a balance between privacy and security .

“ the attempted attack is not a reason for us to change the security laws , ” said bosbach .
he said that in recent years many loopholes in security had been closed , but that legislation could not eliminate human error .
bosbach said , however , that european union plans to relax certain restrictions , such as on bringing liquids onto aircraft , should probably be put on hold .
speaking to the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , he said “ the searches we have now are not a result of security hysteria , rather a necessary step . ”
a key opposition figure , the green party 's hans-christian stroebele , echoed bosbach 's assessment .
he said that last week 's attempted attack was made possible by a failure to correctly assess existing intelligence , not a lack of security .
germany wary of stepping up security the failed bomber , umar farouk abdulmutallab , was on a us watch list of people with extremist ties , and his father , a prominent nigerian banker , had contacted us authorities to say that his son may have travelled to yemen to meet with islamists .

over the weekend , germany 's federal police warned passengers that they could expect longer waits to get through airport security .
but experts remain divided over using more intrusive search methods at airports like the much-debated full-body or " nude " scanner .
the head of a german police union , rainer wendt , said it would be a mistake to use the technology .
that device would allow security personnel to observe a computer-generated reproduction of the contours of a passenger 's body , where well-hidden weapons or explosives might be visible .
that would go “ too far ” in invading people 's privacy , he told the berliner zeitung , and called instead for a heightened police presence at german airports .
holland in favor of new , microwave detectors but on monday , dutch airport authorities said they would make new , microwave scanners mandatory after the attempted attack .
ad rutten , the chief operating officer of schiphol group , told a news conference the airport would introduce the more sensitive detectors pending approval from european authorities . the microwave scanners are not as powerful as the see-through full-body scanners that allow security staff to see passengers virtually naked and detect items swallowed or concealed inside the body .
but they can spot unusual objects on the body and hidden under clothing . ron louwerse , security director for schiphol group , said he was confident the new microwave scanners would get eu approval . " the machine so far gave indications of the body shape and it was also possible to detect whether it was a man or a woman .
this violated certain privacy rules .

“ the attempted attack is not a reason for us to change the security laws , ” said bosbach .
he said that in recent years many loopholes in security had been closed , but that legislation could not eliminate human error .
bosbach said , however , that european union plans to relax certain restrictions , such as on bringing liquids onto aircraft , should probably be put on hold .
speaking to the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , he said “ the searches we have now are not a result of security hysteria , rather a necessary step . ”
a key opposition figure , the green party 's hans-christian stroebele , echoed bosbach 's assessment .
he said that last week 's attempted attack was made possible by a failure to correctly assess existing intelligence , not a lack of security .
germany wary of stepping up security the failed bomber , umar farouk abdulmutallab , was on a us watch list of people with extremist ties , and his father , a prominent nigerian banker , had contacted us authorities to say that his son may have travelled to yemen to meet with islamists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police presence at german airports has become more visible since the attempted bombing of the transatlantic flight , security has been stepped up at german airports , using the means already at the authorities ' disposal .
over the weekend , germany 's federal police warned passengers that they could expect longer waits to get through airport security .
but experts remain divided over using more intrusive search methods at airports like the much-debated full-body or " nude " scanner .
the head of a german police union , rainer wendt , said it would be a mistake to use the technology .
that device would allow security personnel to observe a computer-generated reproduction of the contours of a passenger 's body , where well-hidden weapons or explosives might be visible .
that would go “ too far ” in invading people 's privacy , he told the berliner zeitung , and called instead for a heightened police presence at german airports .
holland in favor of new , microwave detectors but on monday , dutch airport authorities said they would make new , microwave scanners mandatory after the attempted attack .
ad rutten , the chief operating officer of schiphol group , told a news conference the airport would introduce the more sensitive detectors pending approval from european authorities . the microwave scanners are not as powerful as the see-through full-body scanners that allow security staff to see passengers virtually naked and detect items swallowed or concealed inside the body .
but they can spot unusual objects on the body and hidden under clothing . ron louwerse , security director for schiphol group , said he was confident the new microwave scanners would get eu approval . " the machine so far gave indications of the body shape and it was also possible to detect whether it was a man or a woman .
this violated certain privacy rules .
we 've now made some changes and we think this will get approval from european authorities , " he said . louwerse added that schipol airport could probably fully implement the new scanners within a year . mrh / sp / dpa / apd editor : chuck penfold / susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics are voicing environmental concerns . germany has given its second and final approval for the nord stream project .
the 1200 kilometer-long -lrb- 745 miles -rrb- pipeline is to link the russian city of vyborg with greifswald in germany via finnish , swedish and danish waters , to provide gas to western european countries .
on monday the german federal maritime and hydrographic agency granted its permit for the 31 kilometer section in germany 's exclusive economic zone .
the permit for the 50 kilometer stretch through berlin 's territorial waters was granted on december 22 .
monday 's decision marks the final approval from germany for the 7.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- project .
approval from denmark , sweden and russia has already been granted .
finnish approval still outstanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipeline is expected to provide more stable supplies to western europe the only outstanding permit remaining is from finland but nord stream on monday said it was confident that the construction of the pipeline would go ahead as planned .
" we are firmly on schedule to start construction of the pipeline in spring 2010 and to start transporting gas in 2011 , " said the company 's managing director , matthias warnig .
the pipeline is to deliver 55 billion cubic meters of russian gas to western europe each year .
the nord stream project is led by the russian state-owned energy company gazprom in cooperation with german partners e.on ruhrgas and basf-wintershall .
criticism from ukraine and poland the project has been strongly criticized by environmentalist groups who say it puts the ecosystem of the baltic sea at risk .
poland and ukraine have criticized nord stream for taking business away from land pipelines across their territory .
warsaw and kyiv are concerned about losing both transit revenues and bargaining power when it comes to future gas supplies from russia to poland and ukraine .
gas transit through ukraine had repeatedly suffered disruptions in recent years when price disputes between moscow and kyiv led to interruptions of gas supplies not only to ukraine but also to several eu countries. ai / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the tone across the pond has changed drastically , on substance many disagreements remain between the two sides . when german chancellor angela merkel was one of the last major european leaders to have her first official white house visit with barack obama the media speculated that the personal chemistry between chancellor and president was n't right .
but just when it mattered most , the popular president came around for merkel .
with months to go before germany 's general election in september , obama told merkel during her visit to washington in june that he thought she had already won the contest , adding that he did n't understand why she worried so much about it .
the unusually frank exchange , captured by a german television crew , not only showed the two leaders getting along just fine , it also provided a welcome boost for merkel 's international stature back home from a president who was and still is more popular in germany than any national politician .
further proof of how highly merkel is regarded by the new president was her invitation to speak before both houses of congress .
the address to congress took place only weeks after the german election , but was scheduled months ago with the obvious assumption that merkel would be reelected . the good personal chemistry between president and chancellor and obama 's immense international popularity has smoothed over some quite profound differences on major topics .
afghanistan : starting with his famous speech in berlin as a presidential candidate , president obama has repeatedly made it clear that he unlike his predecessor will listen and take into account the advice and concerns of us allies on important international issues .
but he added that he also expected europe to make a fresh start in transatlantic relations and not only voice concerns , but help shape a positive solution to shared problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan the prime testing ground for this new approach is of course afghanistan .
but while the us under obama has made significant changes in its afghan strategy starting with the replacement of the isaf commander , a new focus on counterinsurgency and protection of civilians and a troop surge , germany 's stance remains pretty much the same .
berlin has all but ruled out deploying troops to the more dangerous southern part of the country and in fact is very reluctant to significantly increase its military contingent at all .
despite obama 's hope for a stronger german role in afghanistan , the new center-right government 's position is largely unchanged from that of the grand coalition during the presidency of george w. bush .
financial crisis : while germany and the us agree on the broad goal of mitigating the effects of the worst recession since the 1930s and reforming the global financial system , berlin and washington are not on the same page when it comes to how this can be accomplished .
the german government contends that the goal of stimulating the economy has to be balanced against fiscal responsibility .
for the us administration however , restarting the economy clearly trumps concerns about fiscal stability .
consequently , right after taking office obama repeatedly pushed hard for germany to increase its stimulus packages that the white house viewed as too small .
the same is true when it comes to reforming the financial sector .
to be sure , according to a recent analysis by bloomberg , not one measure that would overhaul the financial system has been put into action in europe or the us .
but while germany by requiring banks to improve their financial resilience has at least made a stab at reform , the us so far has n't .
there 's also great reluctance in the us to back european proposals to curb bankers ' bonuses , a move that would have little economic relevance , but huge public significance .
however , neither germany nor the us have made serious efforts to split up the so called too-big-to fail universal banks , a measure that is supported by experts like joseph stiglitz and paul volcker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has a tough time getting climate change through congress climate change : the new us administration by acknowledging the problem and by vowing to take an active role in combating climate change reversed the stance of bush presidency - at least in theory .
but as observers in germany have had to learn against the backdrop of the failed negotiations at the copenhagen climate conference , even an american president who supports european efforts to curb global warming can not by himself convince a reluctant congress to sign on to an international climate change treaty . so what then is the state of us-german relations in year one of the obama presidency ?
compared to the bush administration , the rhetoric and the tone in the transatlantic conversation improved dramatically under president obama .
as promised during his election campaign , he has tried to seriously consult and engage with germany and other european partners and focused on a multilateral approach .
for this he has been rewarded with strong approval ratings in germany and europe .
on substance , however , there is little change in transatlantic affairs .
when push comes to shove , when words need to be translated into action the current leaderships in the us and germany have not behaved very differently to those under the previous administrations .
that is true not just on afghanistan , the financial crisis and climate change , but also on other issues such as how to deal with the guantanamo prisoners .

while the tone across the pond has changed drastically , on substance many disagreements remain between the two sides . when german chancellor angela merkel was one of the last major european leaders to have her first official white house visit with barack obama the media speculated that the personal chemistry between chancellor and president was n't right .
but just when it mattered most , the popular president came around for merkel .
with months to go before germany 's general election in september , obama told merkel during her visit to washington in june that he thought she had already won the contest , adding that he did n't understand why she worried so much about it .
the unusually frank exchange , captured by a german television crew , not only showed the two leaders getting along just fine , it also provided a welcome boost for merkel 's international stature back home from a president who was and still is more popular in germany than any national politician .
further proof of how highly merkel is regarded by the new president was her invitation to speak before both houses of congress .
the address to congress took place only weeks after the german election , but was scheduled months ago with the obvious assumption that merkel would be reelected . the good personal chemistry between president and chancellor and obama 's immense international popularity has smoothed over some quite profound differences on major topics .
afghanistan : starting with his famous speech in berlin as a presidential candidate , president obama has repeatedly made it clear that he unlike his predecessor will listen and take into account the advice and concerns of us allies on important international issues .
but he added that he also expected europe to make a fresh start in transatlantic relations and not only voice concerns , but help shape a positive solution to shared problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan the prime testing ground for this new approach is of course afghanistan .
but while the us under obama has made significant changes in its afghan strategy starting with the replacement of the isaf commander , a new focus on counterinsurgency and protection of civilians and a troop surge , germany 's stance remains pretty much the same .
berlin has all but ruled out deploying troops to the more dangerous southern part of the country and in fact is very reluctant to significantly increase its military contingent at all .
despite obama 's hope for a stronger german role in afghanistan , the new center-right government 's position is largely unchanged from that of the grand coalition during the presidency of george w. bush .
financial crisis : while germany and the us agree on the broad goal of mitigating the effects of the worst recession since the 1930s and reforming the global financial system , berlin and washington are not on the same page when it comes to how this can be accomplished .
the german government contends that the goal of stimulating the economy has to be balanced against fiscal responsibility .
for the us administration however , restarting the economy clearly trumps concerns about fiscal stability .
consequently , right after taking office obama repeatedly pushed hard for germany to increase its stimulus packages that the white house viewed as too small .
the same is true when it comes to reforming the financial sector .
to be sure , according to a recent analysis by bloomberg , not one measure that would overhaul the financial system has been put into action in europe or the us .
but while germany by requiring banks to improve their financial resilience has at least made a stab at reform , the us so far has n't .
there 's also great reluctance in the us to back european proposals to curb bankers ' bonuses , a move that would have little economic relevance , but huge public significance .
however , neither germany nor the us have made serious efforts to split up the so called too-big-to fail universal banks , a measure that is supported by experts like joseph stiglitz and paul volcker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has a tough time getting climate change through congress climate change : the new us administration by acknowledging the problem and by vowing to take an active role in combating climate change reversed the stance of bush presidency - at least in theory .
but as observers in germany have had to learn against the backdrop of the failed negotiations at the copenhagen climate conference , even an american president who supports european efforts to curb global warming can not by himself convince a reluctant congress to sign on to an international climate change treaty . so what then is the state of us-german relations in year one of the obama presidency ?
compared to the bush administration , the rhetoric and the tone in the transatlantic conversation improved dramatically under president obama .
as promised during his election campaign , he has tried to seriously consult and engage with germany and other european partners and focused on a multilateral approach .
for this he has been rewarded with strong approval ratings in germany and europe .
on substance , however , there is little change in transatlantic affairs .
when push comes to shove , when words need to be translated into action the current leaderships in the us and germany have not behaved very differently to those under the previous administrations .

while the tone across the pond has changed drastically , on substance many disagreements remain between the two sides . when german chancellor angela merkel was one of the last major european leaders to have her first official white house visit with barack obama the media speculated that the personal chemistry between chancellor and president was n't right .
but just when it mattered most , the popular president came around for merkel .
with months to go before germany 's general election in september , obama told merkel during her visit to washington in june that he thought she had already won the contest , adding that he did n't understand why she worried so much about it .
the unusually frank exchange , captured by a german television crew , not only showed the two leaders getting along just fine , it also provided a welcome boost for merkel 's international stature back home from a president who was and still is more popular in germany than any national politician .
further proof of how highly merkel is regarded by the new president was her invitation to speak before both houses of congress .
the address to congress took place only weeks after the german election , but was scheduled months ago with the obvious assumption that merkel would be reelected . the good personal chemistry between president and chancellor and obama 's immense international popularity has smoothed over some quite profound differences on major topics .
afghanistan : starting with his famous speech in berlin as a presidential candidate , president obama has repeatedly made it clear that he unlike his predecessor will listen and take into account the advice and concerns of us allies on important international issues .
but he added that he also expected europe to make a fresh start in transatlantic relations and not only voice concerns , but help shape a positive solution to shared problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan the prime testing ground for this new approach is of course afghanistan .
but while the us under obama has made significant changes in its afghan strategy starting with the replacement of the isaf commander , a new focus on counterinsurgency and protection of civilians and a troop surge , germany 's stance remains pretty much the same .
berlin has all but ruled out deploying troops to the more dangerous southern part of the country and in fact is very reluctant to significantly increase its military contingent at all .
despite obama 's hope for a stronger german role in afghanistan , the new center-right government 's position is largely unchanged from that of the grand coalition during the presidency of george w. bush .
financial crisis : while germany and the us agree on the broad goal of mitigating the effects of the worst recession since the 1930s and reforming the global financial system , berlin and washington are not on the same page when it comes to how this can be accomplished .
the german government contends that the goal of stimulating the economy has to be balanced against fiscal responsibility .
for the us administration however , restarting the economy clearly trumps concerns about fiscal stability .
consequently , right after taking office obama repeatedly pushed hard for germany to increase its stimulus packages that the white house viewed as too small .
the same is true when it comes to reforming the financial sector .
to be sure , according to a recent analysis by bloomberg , not one measure that would overhaul the financial system has been put into action in europe or the us .
but while germany by requiring banks to improve their financial resilience has at least made a stab at reform , the us so far has n't .
there 's also great reluctance in the us to back european proposals to curb bankers ' bonuses , a move that would have little economic relevance , but huge public significance .
however , neither germany nor the us have made serious efforts to split up the so called too-big-to fail universal banks , a measure that is supported by experts like joseph stiglitz and paul volcker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has a tough time getting climate change through congress climate change : the new us administration by acknowledging the problem and by vowing to take an active role in combating climate change reversed the stance of bush presidency - at least in theory .
but as observers in germany have had to learn against the backdrop of the failed negotiations at the copenhagen climate conference , even an american president who supports european efforts to curb global warming can not by himself convince a reluctant congress to sign on to an international climate change treaty . so what then is the state of us-german relations in year one of the obama presidency ?
compared to the bush administration , the rhetoric and the tone in the transatlantic conversation improved dramatically under president obama .
as promised during his election campaign , he has tried to seriously consult and engage with germany and other european partners and focused on a multilateral approach .
for this he has been rewarded with strong approval ratings in germany and europe .
on substance , however , there is little change in transatlantic affairs .
when push comes to shove , when words need to be translated into action the current leaderships in the us and germany have not behaved very differently to those under the previous administrations .

while the tone across the pond has changed drastically , on substance many disagreements remain between the two sides . when german chancellor angela merkel was one of the last major european leaders to have her first official white house visit with barack obama the media speculated that the personal chemistry between chancellor and president was n't right .
but just when it mattered most , the popular president came around for merkel .
with months to go before germany 's general election in september , obama told merkel during her visit to washington in june that he thought she had already won the contest , adding that he did n't understand why she worried so much about it .
the unusually frank exchange , captured by a german television crew , not only showed the two leaders getting along just fine , it also provided a welcome boost for merkel 's international stature back home from a president who was and still is more popular in germany than any national politician .
further proof of how highly merkel is regarded by the new president was her invitation to speak before both houses of congress .
the address to congress took place only weeks after the german election , but was scheduled months ago with the obvious assumption that merkel would be reelected . the good personal chemistry between president and chancellor and obama 's immense international popularity has smoothed over some quite profound differences on major topics .
afghanistan : starting with his famous speech in berlin as a presidential candidate , president obama has repeatedly made it clear that he unlike his predecessor will listen and take into account the advice and concerns of us allies on important international issues .
but he added that he also expected europe to make a fresh start in transatlantic relations and not only voice concerns , but help shape a positive solution to shared problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan the prime testing ground for this new approach is of course afghanistan .
but while the us under obama has made significant changes in its afghan strategy starting with the replacement of the isaf commander , a new focus on counterinsurgency and protection of civilians and a troop surge , germany 's stance remains pretty much the same .
berlin has all but ruled out deploying troops to the more dangerous southern part of the country and in fact is very reluctant to significantly increase its military contingent at all .
despite obama 's hope for a stronger german role in afghanistan , the new center-right government 's position is largely unchanged from that of the grand coalition during the presidency of george w. bush .
financial crisis : while germany and the us agree on the broad goal of mitigating the effects of the worst recession since the 1930s and reforming the global financial system , berlin and washington are not on the same page when it comes to how this can be accomplished .
the german government contends that the goal of stimulating the economy has to be balanced against fiscal responsibility .
for the us administration however , restarting the economy clearly trumps concerns about fiscal stability .
consequently , right after taking office obama repeatedly pushed hard for germany to increase its stimulus packages that the white house viewed as too small .
the same is true when it comes to reforming the financial sector .
to be sure , according to a recent analysis by bloomberg , not one measure that would overhaul the financial system has been put into action in europe or the us .
but while germany by requiring banks to improve their financial resilience has at least made a stab at reform , the us so far has n't .
there 's also great reluctance in the us to back european proposals to curb bankers ' bonuses , a move that would have little economic relevance , but huge public significance .
however , neither germany nor the us have made serious efforts to split up the so called too-big-to fail universal banks , a measure that is supported by experts like joseph stiglitz and paul volcker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has a tough time getting climate change through congress climate change : the new us administration by acknowledging the problem and by vowing to take an active role in combating climate change reversed the stance of bush presidency - at least in theory .
but as observers in germany have had to learn against the backdrop of the failed negotiations at the copenhagen climate conference , even an american president who supports european efforts to curb global warming can not by himself convince a reluctant congress to sign on to an international climate change treaty . so what then is the state of us-german relations in year one of the obama presidency ?
compared to the bush administration , the rhetoric and the tone in the transatlantic conversation improved dramatically under president obama .
as promised during his election campaign , he has tried to seriously consult and engage with germany and other european partners and focused on a multilateral approach .
for this he has been rewarded with strong approval ratings in germany and europe .
on substance , however , there is little change in transatlantic affairs .
when push comes to shove , when words need to be translated into action the current leaderships in the us and germany have not behaved very differently to those under the previous administrations .
that is true not just on afghanistan , the financial crisis and climate change , but also on other issues such as how to deal with the guantanamo prisoners .

kyiv , however , says the dispute will not affect oil transits to the eu . russia has informed the eu that slovakia , the czech republic and hungary might be affected by a cut in russian oil supplies , slovakian prime minister robert fico said on monday .
russian oil company transneft earlier accused ukraine of setting " unacceptable " terms for oil transit .
kyiv downplayed the tensions , saying that russia 's warning to the eu was merely aimed at discrediting ukraine as a reliable transit country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : price disputes between moscow and kyiv have become an annual problem the renewed concerns come as the international monetary fund has rejected ukraine 's request for a 2 billion dollar loan to help the country meet obligations by the end of the year .
in recent years , price disputes between moscow and kyiv had repeatedly led to supply cuts which left millions of europeans in the cold .
hungary , slovakia and czech republic most hit " it 's not about a shortage of oil , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters on monday .
" it 's about a bilateral dispute between two countries who are not eu members but who are vitally important for slovakia and a few other eu nations when it comes to energy supplies . "
he said his country had received a letter warning of an " increased risk " over oil shortages and that hungary , slovakia and the czech republic would be hit hardest .
hungary 's energy ministry on monday confirmed that budapest had also been informed of russia 's warning over oil shortages from january 1 .
ukraine moved quickly to dispel any such concerns , saying that the eu had " no reasons to worry " about possible disruptions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom has downplayed worries over renewed shortages government spokesman bogdan sokolovsky said the ukrainian state energy company naftogaz was seeking higher transit fees merely so that they would reflect inflation and rising maintenance costs . russia 's transneft , however , has called the new terms for the oil transit via the ukrainian black sea port of yuzhny unacceptable .
" the process is continuing and i hope we will solve it before the new year , " transneft 's president nikolai tokarev said .
" but if they insist on their terms , we will also review the prospects of supplies . "
russia 's gas monopoly gazprom , however , said on monday there was no danger of a repeat of the gas rows with ukraine that had left parts of europe with drastic energy shortages in recent winters. ai / reuters / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu said it was illegal under international law to construct further settlements on occupied palestinian land . " the presidency of the european union is dismayed at the announcement of the government of israel to build nearly 700 apartments in occupied east jerusalem , " said a statement from sweden , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
earlier on monday , israel had announced plans to build almost 700 new apartments in occupied east jerusalem .
the new homes will be located in areas which israel captured in the 1967 middle east war .
" settlements on occupied land are illegal under international law , " the eu statement said .
" the presidency of the european union thus urges the government of israel to reconsider these plans . "
the new settlement plans have already prompted strong protests from the palestinian side .
president mahmoud abbas has refused to resume peace talks without a complete israeli halt to settlement construction in east jerusalem .
the palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of their future state while israel claims both east and west jerusalem as part of its " eternal , indivisible " capital .
palestinians call on us for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas has his hopes pinned on international support from the us and the eu chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat warned the development " further sabotaged international efforts to resume permanent status negotiations . "
erekat called on the us to clarify its position on israel 's obligation to freeze all settlement construction as agreed under the 2003 road map peace plan .
later on monday , white house spokesman robert gibbs said the united states " opposes new israeli construction in east jerusalem . "
around 500,000 israelis live in settlements in east jerusalem and the west bank deemed illegal under international law .
israel 's capture and annexation of the territory during the middle east war 1967 was never recognized by the international community .
the continued expansion of settlements - especially in east jerusalem - is seen as one of the major obstacles to peace talks between israelis and palestinians. ai / dpa / afpe editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics are voicing environmental concerns . germany has given its second and final approval for the nord stream project .
the 1200 kilometer-long -lrb- 745 miles -rrb- pipeline is to link the russian city of vyborg with greifswald in germany via finnish , swedish and danish waters , to provide gas to western european countries .
on monday the german federal maritime and hydrographic agency granted its permit for the 31 kilometer section in germany 's exclusive economic zone .
the permit for the 50 kilometer stretch through berlin 's territorial waters was granted on december 22 .
monday 's decision marks the final approval from germany for the 7.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- project .
approval from denmark , sweden and russia has already been granted .
finnish approval still outstanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipeline is expected to provide more stable supplies to western europe the only outstanding permit remaining is from finland but nord stream on monday said it was confident that the construction of the pipeline would go ahead as planned .
" we are firmly on schedule to start construction of the pipeline in spring 2010 and to start transporting gas in 2011 , " said the company 's managing director , matthias warnig .
the pipeline is to deliver 55 billion cubic meters of russian gas to western europe each year .
the nord stream project is led by the russian state-owned energy company gazprom in cooperation with german partners e.on ruhrgas and basf-wintershall .

“ the attempted attack is not a reason for us to change the security laws , ” said bosbach .
he said that in recent years many loopholes in security had been closed , but that legislation could not eliminate human error .
bosbach said , however , that european union plans to relax certain restrictions , such as on bringing liquids onto aircraft , should probably be put on hold .
speaking to the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , he said “ the searches we have now are not a result of security hysteria , rather a necessary step . ”
a key opposition figure , the green party 's hans-christian stroebele , echoed bosbach 's assessment .
he said that last week 's attempted attack was made possible by a failure to correctly assess existing intelligence , not a lack of security .
germany wary of stepping up security the failed bomber , umar farouk abdulmutallab , was on a us watch list of people with extremist ties , and his father , a prominent nigerian banker , had contacted us authorities to say that his son may have travelled to yemen to meet with islamists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police presence at german airports has become more visible since the attempted bombing of the transatlantic flight , security has been stepped up at german airports , using the means already at the authorities ' disposal .
over the weekend , germany 's federal police warned passengers that they could expect longer waits to get through airport security .
but experts remain divided over using more intrusive search methods at airports like the much-debated full-body or " nude " scanner .
the head of a german police union , rainer wendt , said it would be a mistake to use the technology .
that device would allow security personnel to observe a computer-generated reproduction of the contours of a passenger 's body , where well-hidden weapons or explosives might be visible .
that would go “ too far ” in invading people 's privacy , he told the berliner zeitung , and called instead for a heightened police presence at german airports .
holland in favor of new , microwave detectors but on monday , dutch airport authorities said they would make new , microwave scanners mandatory after the attempted attack .
ad rutten , the chief operating officer of schiphol group , told a news conference the airport would introduce the more sensitive detectors pending approval from european authorities . the microwave scanners are not as powerful as the see-through full-body scanners that allow security staff to see passengers virtually naked and detect items swallowed or concealed inside the body .
but they can spot unusual objects on the body and hidden under clothing . ron louwerse , security director for schiphol group , said he was confident the new microwave scanners would get eu approval . " the machine so far gave indications of the body shape and it was also possible to detect whether it was a man or a woman .
this violated certain privacy rules .
we 've now made some changes and we think this will get approval from european authorities , " he said . louwerse added that schipol airport could probably fully implement the new scanners within a year . mrh / sp / dpa / apd editor : chuck penfold / susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after hovering both above and below that level throughout the day , it closed at 6,003 points .
" this is a psychological victory , " baader bank market analyst robert halver told dpa news agency .
" the breach of the 6,000 barrier is certainly a positive signal . "
the dax index stood at 6234 points in mid-september 2008 , before the collapse of the us-based lehman brothers investment bank triggered chaos on world financial markets ..
by march 2009 the dax had dropped to around 3,600 points , its lowest level since 2003 .
but some traders warned that low trading volumes meant recent gains should not be overvalued .
dow jones newswires quoted a deutsche bank trader as saying that trading volumes were expected to remain thin until the end of the year , and cited positive sentiment on asian markets and us movements on friday as reasons for the breakthrough .
in new york , traders were reportedly set to close 2009 on a high note , with markets expected to hold on to solid gains after staging a remarkable turnaround from a chaotic start to the year. sje / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the week-long tournament showcases the best of alpine ski jumping . the german delegation at the week-long four hills tournament got off to a good start - all seven competitors made it through qualification of the first event - but grabbing a spot on the podium in the ski-jumping festival will be like skiing into the wind . the tournament , taking place for the 58th time , brings together the world 's best ski jumpers for the highlight of alpine skiing .
the ski jumpers compete at four sites in germany and austria to usher in the new year , and the skier with the best combined results at the end of all four competitions is the winner . veteran competitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmitt downplays his chances at the four hills while this year 's favorites are switzerland 's simon ammann and austria 's gregor schlierenzauer , germany 's best chance at a medal will come from either pascal bodmer or martin schmitt - two skiers at opposite ends of their careers who may learn a thing or two from each other . schmitt is a well-known figure in the world of ski jumping .
at the 2002 olympic games in salt lake city in the united states , schmitt took gold with the german k120 team and was the runner-up in last season 's world championships . however , as schmitt approaches his 32nd birthday in january , he admits that his sights are set a bit lower for the four hills tournament . " i 'm pretty sure i 'm not competing as one of the favorites , " schmitt told the german sports news agency sid .
" way up at the front it looks a little bleak -lsb- for him -rsb- . " roomies although schmitt might not be a medal contender , his presence at the four hills could rub off on one of his teammates . schmitt 's roommate for the first competition in obertsdorf is pascal bodmer , an up-and-comer on the german team and its best shot at a medal .
schmitt says the youngster , who turns 19 next week , is a very calm and collected roommate , especially before a competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal bodmer is in his second four hills tournament " normally before i compete i 'm antsy and running around the room , " schmitt told the german news agency dpa .
" but he 's sitting in bed , totally calm , saying ' you 've still got time . " ' this will be bodmer 's second four hills tournament , and while his expectations are higher than the first time -lrb- " last year it was just important to be in the tournament " -rrb- , he 's still got to beat out the likes of ammann and schlierenzauer for a chance at a medal . competition from across the border switzerland 's ammann maintains an edge with three victories on the world cup circuit this season already under his belt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon ammann , far left , with last year 's winner wolfgang loitzl , center and finland 's harri olli the two-time gold medalist from the 2002 olympics is hoping to become the first swiss winner of the four hills . last year , he came a disappointing eighth place in the third round of the four hills at innsbruck , which ended his hopes of winning the prestigious title . he 'll face stiff competition from the much younger schlierenzauer . the 19-year-old austrian ski jumper has already chalked up 26 world cup wins .
and he came third in last year 's four hills event . " i am in form , i 'm in a hurry to take part in the four hills , " schlierenzauer said . the four hills contest has a tradition of producing surprise winners .
last year , austria 's wolfgang loitzl clinched three victories and a second place to storm to four hills victory . from oberstdorf , the four hills tournament moves on to garmisch-partenkirchen , and then to the austrian resorts of innsbruck and bischofshofen . mz / sp / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after hovering both above and below that level throughout the day , it closed at 6,003 points .
" this is a psychological victory , " baader bank market analyst robert halver told dpa news agency .
" the breach of the 6,000 barrier is certainly a positive signal . "
the dax index stood at 6234 points in mid-september 2008 , before the collapse of the us-based lehman brothers investment bank triggered chaos on world financial markets ..
by march 2009 the dax had dropped to around 3,600 points , its lowest level since 2003 .
but some traders warned that low trading volumes meant recent gains should not be overvalued .
dow jones newswires quoted a deutsche bank trader as saying that trading volumes were expected to remain thin until the end of the year , and cited positive sentiment on asian markets and us movements on friday as reasons for the breakthrough .
in new york , traders were reportedly set to close 2009 on a high note , with markets expected to hold on to solid gains after staging a remarkable turnaround from a chaotic start to the year. sje / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the week-long tournament showcases the best of alpine ski jumping . the german delegation at the week-long four hills tournament got off to a good start - all seven competitors made it through qualification of the first event - but grabbing a spot on the podium in the ski-jumping festival will be like skiing into the wind . the tournament , taking place for the 58th time , brings together the world 's best ski jumpers for the highlight of alpine skiing .
the ski jumpers compete at four sites in germany and austria to usher in the new year , and the skier with the best combined results at the end of all four competitions is the winner . veteran competitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmitt downplays his chances at the four hills while this year 's favorites are switzerland 's simon ammann and austria 's gregor schlierenzauer , germany 's best chance at a medal will come from either pascal bodmer or martin schmitt - two skiers at opposite ends of their careers who may learn a thing or two from each other . schmitt is a well-known figure in the world of ski jumping .
at the 2002 olympic games in salt lake city in the united states , schmitt took gold with the german k120 team and was the runner-up in last season 's world championships . however , as schmitt approaches his 32nd birthday in january , he admits that his sights are set a bit lower for the four hills tournament . " i 'm pretty sure i 'm not competing as one of the favorites , " schmitt told the german sports news agency sid .
" way up at the front it looks a little bleak -lsb- for him -rsb- . " roomies although schmitt might not be a medal contender , his presence at the four hills could rub off on one of his teammates . schmitt 's roommate for the first competition in obertsdorf is pascal bodmer , an up-and-comer on the german team and its best shot at a medal .
schmitt says the youngster , who turns 19 next week , is a very calm and collected roommate , especially before a competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal bodmer is in his second four hills tournament " normally before i compete i 'm antsy and running around the room , " schmitt told the german news agency dpa .
" but he 's sitting in bed , totally calm , saying ' you 've still got time . " ' this will be bodmer 's second four hills tournament , and while his expectations are higher than the first time -lrb- " last year it was just important to be in the tournament " -rrb- , he 's still got to beat out the likes of ammann and schlierenzauer for a chance at a medal . competition from across the border switzerland 's ammann maintains an edge with three victories on the world cup circuit this season already under his belt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon ammann , far left , with last year 's winner wolfgang loitzl , center and finland 's harri olli the two-time gold medalist from the 2002 olympics is hoping to become the first swiss winner of the four hills . last year , he came a disappointing eighth place in the third round of the four hills at innsbruck , which ended his hopes of winning the prestigious title . he 'll face stiff competition from the much younger schlierenzauer . the 19-year-old austrian ski jumper has already chalked up 26 world cup wins .
and he came third in last year 's four hills event . " i am in form , i 'm in a hurry to take part in the four hills , " schlierenzauer said . the four hills contest has a tradition of producing surprise winners .
last year , austria 's wolfgang loitzl clinched three victories and a second place to storm to four hills victory . from oberstdorf , the four hills tournament moves on to garmisch-partenkirchen , and then to the austrian resorts of innsbruck and bischofshofen . mz / sp / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the presidency of the european union thus urges the government of israel to reconsider these plans . "
the new settlement plans have already prompted strong protests from the palestinian side .
president mahmoud abbas has refused to resume peace talks without a complete israeli halt to settlement construction in east jerusalem .
the palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of their future state while israel claims both east and west jerusalem as part of its " eternal , indivisible " capital .
palestinians call on us for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas has his hopes pinned on international support from the us and the eu chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat warned the development " further sabotaged international efforts to resume permanent status negotiations . "
erekat called on the us to clarify its position on israel 's obligation to freeze all settlement construction as agreed under the 2003 road map peace plan .
later on monday , white house spokesman robert gibbs said the united states " opposes new israeli construction in east jerusalem . "
around 500,000 israelis live in settlements in east jerusalem and the west bank deemed illegal under international law .
israel 's capture and annexation of the territory during the middle east war 1967 was never recognized by the international community .
the continued expansion of settlements - especially in east jerusalem - is seen as one of the major obstacles to peace talks between israelis and palestinians. ai / dpa / afpe editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ the attempted attack is not a reason for us to change the security laws , ” said bosbach .
he said that in recent years many loopholes in security had been closed , but that legislation could not eliminate human error .
bosbach said , however , that european union plans to relax certain restrictions , such as on bringing liquids onto aircraft , should probably be put on hold .
speaking to the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , he said “ the searches we have now are not a result of security hysteria , rather a necessary step . ”
a key opposition figure , the green party 's hans-christian stroebele , echoed bosbach 's assessment .

that device would allow security personnel to observe a computer-generated reproduction of the contours of a passenger 's body , where well-hidden weapons or explosives might be visible .
that would go “ too far ” in invading people 's privacy , he told the berliner zeitung , and called instead for a heightened police presence at german airports .

after hovering both above and below that level throughout the day , it closed at 6,003 points .
" this is a psychological victory , " baader bank market analyst robert halver told dpa news agency .
" the breach of the 6,000 barrier is certainly a positive signal . "
the dax index stood at 6234 points in mid-september 2008 , before the collapse of the us-based lehman brothers investment bank triggered chaos on world financial markets ..
by march 2009 the dax had dropped to around 3,600 points , its lowest level since 2003 .
but some traders warned that low trading volumes meant recent gains should not be overvalued .
dow jones newswires quoted a deutsche bank trader as saying that trading volumes were expected to remain thin until the end of the year , and cited positive sentiment on asian markets and us movements on friday as reasons for the breakthrough .
in new york , traders were reportedly set to close 2009 on a high note , with markets expected to hold on to solid gains after staging a remarkable turnaround from a chaotic start to the year. sje / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but german politicians are n't quite ready for that much exposure in airports . full body scanners would allow security personnel to observe a computer-generated reproduction of the contours of a passenger 's body , where well-hidden weapons or explosives might be visible . in germany , critics of the devices say the scanners are too intrusive concerning passengers ' privacy , and have called for a solution that does not reveal as much of a person 's body . " we do n't want nude scanners where the contours of the passengers ' bodies are clearly depicted on a screen , and where we ca n't be sure if the passengers ' private parts are visible , " said wolfgang bosbach , chairman of the parliamentary internal affairs committee , in an interview with ard public television . " but on the other hand , we obviously have to find a way to ensure that dangerous substances are recognized , be they solid or liquid explosives , so that materials that are n't picked up by a metal detector ca n't be smuggled on board , " he added . gisela piltz , deputy chairperson of the free democrats parliamentary party , said a device that did not reveal the private areas of a passenger 's body was the right way to find a balance between privacy and security . " if people 's dignity is to be preserved , then we should invest in this kind of a system for the security of the passengers , " piltz said in an interview with the daily newspaper rheinische post .

kyiv , however , says the dispute will not affect oil transits to the eu . russia has informed the eu that slovakia , the czech republic and hungary might be affected by a cut in russian oil supplies , slovakian prime minister robert fico said on monday .
russian oil company transneft earlier accused ukraine of setting " unacceptable " terms for oil transit .
kyiv downplayed the tensions , saying that russia 's warning to the eu was merely aimed at discrediting ukraine as a reliable transit country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : price disputes between moscow and kyiv have become an annual problem the renewed concerns come as the international monetary fund has rejected ukraine 's request for a 2 billion dollar loan to help the country meet obligations by the end of the year .

hungary , slovakia and czech republic most hit " it 's not about a shortage of oil , " slovak prime minister robert fico told reporters on monday .
" it 's about a bilateral dispute between two countries who are not eu members but who are vitally important for slovakia and a few other eu nations when it comes to energy supplies . "
he said his country had received a letter warning of an " increased risk " over oil shortages and that hungary , slovakia and the czech republic would be hit hardest .
hungary 's energy ministry on monday confirmed that budapest had also been informed of russia 's warning over oil shortages from january 1 .

" the process is continuing and i hope we will solve it before the new year , " transneft 's president nikolai tokarev said .
" but if they insist on their terms , we will also review the prospects of supplies . "

but back at home , the families and the partners of troops serving abroad also suffer . the families and partners of soldiers despatched to international conflict zones must often live with the very real fear their loved ones may not come home .
and so the military chaplaincy of the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , has launched a project to help families cope with the pressure this puts on their lives and relationships .
more than 7,000 german soldiers are currently serving on overseas missions , more than half of them in afghanistan .
in that country , the german troops are stationed in the relatively quiet north but that does n't mean they 're safe .
so far , 40 german soldiers and members of the police force have lost their lives .
the priests who accompany the german troops say this can also place a huge emotional burden on soldiers ' families back home .
for this reason , the catholic military bishopric has started a new program to help prepare families for the stresses of seeing loved ones sent away to conflict zones .
a helping hand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military chaplaincy wants the bundeswehr to do more for soldiers ' families and partners the project 's leader , peter wendl , says part of the task involves talking with military priests and couples who have already experienced foreign assignments .
he says a part of the problem is that couples often do n't talk about how they feel when one of them is sent away .
" throughout the interviews , it seemed that the fears of one partner or the other were n't articulated because they were incapable of expressing them or too insecure or because they felt helpless , " he says , " which naturally affected their relationships and their family life . "
wendl says that the fears a soldier experiences when on a dangerous patrol must be aired , and so should the fears a husband or wife back in germany may have that they could lose their partner and end up having to raise their children alone .
" we find that couples feel unbelievable relief when they get help in our seminars , and when they are given the chance to articulate their fears , " he says .
wendl has developed a training plan for the military chaplaincy which he hopes will make couples better able to cope with the stresses of foreign assignment .
the plan includes a step-by-step guide to the types of situations and crises they might go through during missions .
but wendl warns that the church is unable to do all the work for couples and families .
he says the best way to safeguard emotional wellbeing is to stay positive about the mission , and remain committed .
the burden of uncertainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are frequently targeted by insurgency attacks military dean monsignor rainer schadt has been accompanying german soldiers to crisis regions around the world since 1992 .
when it comes to germany 's current mission in afghanistan , he says military chaplains are witnessing a new challenge .
" increasingly we 're seeing not only experienced troops returning home , but also troops that have seen combat , " he says .
" this means we have another field to plough .
soldiers return home without having sustained injuries themselves , but rather have had to injure , and sometimes even kill , others in carrying out their duties .
" how families and soldiers deal with this phenomenon back at home is going to be a big part of our work in the future , " he adds .
the fear of knowing that a loved one is an enemy target can be an overwhelming burden , says this woman , whose partner served with the bundeswehr on three tours of duty abroad .
" i was afraid of what could happen , what could happen to him - the possibility that he may come back a different person from who he was when he left .
the fact that he could lose a leg or an arm , or be killed .
of course , these are the fears we have , " she says .

but back at home , the families and the partners of troops serving abroad also suffer . the families and partners of soldiers despatched to international conflict zones must often live with the very real fear their loved ones may not come home .
and so the military chaplaincy of the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , has launched a project to help families cope with the pressure this puts on their lives and relationships .
more than 7,000 german soldiers are currently serving on overseas missions , more than half of them in afghanistan .
in that country , the german troops are stationed in the relatively quiet north but that does n't mean they 're safe .
so far , 40 german soldiers and members of the police force have lost their lives .
the priests who accompany the german troops say this can also place a huge emotional burden on soldiers ' families back home .
for this reason , the catholic military bishopric has started a new program to help prepare families for the stresses of seeing loved ones sent away to conflict zones .
a helping hand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military chaplaincy wants the bundeswehr to do more for soldiers ' families and partners the project 's leader , peter wendl , says part of the task involves talking with military priests and couples who have already experienced foreign assignments .
he says a part of the problem is that couples often do n't talk about how they feel when one of them is sent away .
" throughout the interviews , it seemed that the fears of one partner or the other were n't articulated because they were incapable of expressing them or too insecure or because they felt helpless , " he says , " which naturally affected their relationships and their family life . "
wendl says that the fears a soldier experiences when on a dangerous patrol must be aired , and so should the fears a husband or wife back in germany may have that they could lose their partner and end up having to raise their children alone .
" we find that couples feel unbelievable relief when they get help in our seminars , and when they are given the chance to articulate their fears , " he says .
wendl has developed a training plan for the military chaplaincy which he hopes will make couples better able to cope with the stresses of foreign assignment .
the plan includes a step-by-step guide to the types of situations and crises they might go through during missions .
but wendl warns that the church is unable to do all the work for couples and families .
he says the best way to safeguard emotional wellbeing is to stay positive about the mission , and remain committed .
the burden of uncertainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are frequently targeted by insurgency attacks military dean monsignor rainer schadt has been accompanying german soldiers to crisis regions around the world since 1992 .
when it comes to germany 's current mission in afghanistan , he says military chaplains are witnessing a new challenge .
" increasingly we 're seeing not only experienced troops returning home , but also troops that have seen combat , " he says .
" this means we have another field to plough .
soldiers return home without having sustained injuries themselves , but rather have had to injure , and sometimes even kill , others in carrying out their duties .
" how families and soldiers deal with this phenomenon back at home is going to be a big part of our work in the future , " he adds .
the fear of knowing that a loved one is an enemy target can be an overwhelming burden , says this woman , whose partner served with the bundeswehr on three tours of duty abroad .
" i was afraid of what could happen , what could happen to him - the possibility that he may come back a different person from who he was when he left .
the fact that he could lose a leg or an arm , or be killed .
of course , these are the fears we have , " she says .

the german wikipedia site is celebrating its landmark millionth article after more than eight years of operation . the german version of the free online encyclopedia wikipedia passed a significant hurdle on sunday as it observed its one millionth entry .
the landmark article was about the american botanist ernie wasson .
some in the wikipedia community felt , however , that this topic was too insignificant and nominated it for deletion .
if that should come to pass , then an article about german speed skater robert seifert would take the honor of being the site 's one millionth article .
looking ahead the first german wikipedia article was written by biochemist magnus manske in may 2001 .
it described the so-called polymerase chain reaction , which duplicates dna in a test tube .
the german site is expecting to reach its next milestone , its two millionth entry , sometime in 2015 .
the german wiki , a collection of hyperlinked , publicly edited encyclopedic articles , is surpassed in size only by the english version , which has more than three million .
after german , the french wikipedia page has the third most entries at more than 890,000 , followed by the polish and then italian pages with 662,000 and 642,000 respectively .
across all languages there are more than 13 million wikipedia articles in more than 250 languages , according to the wikimedia foundation. sjt / dpa / glp editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after hovering both above and below that level throughout the day , it closed at 6,003 points .
" this is a psychological victory , " baader bank market analyst robert halver told dpa news agency .
" the breach of the 6,000 barrier is certainly a positive signal . "
the dax index stood at 6234 points in mid-september 2008 , before the collapse of the us-based lehman brothers investment bank triggered chaos on world financial markets ..
by march 2009 the dax had dropped to around 3,600 points , its lowest level since 2003 .
but some traders warned that low trading volumes meant recent gains should not be overvalued .
dow jones newswires quoted a deutsche bank trader as saying that trading volumes were expected to remain thin until the end of the year , and cited positive sentiment on asian markets and us movements on friday as reasons for the breakthrough .
in new york , traders were reportedly set to close 2009 on a high note , with markets expected to hold on to solid gains after staging a remarkable turnaround from a chaotic start to the year. sje / afp / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the state english-language press tv confirmed the deaths , citing iran ’ s supreme national security council .
as many as 300 demonstrators were arrested following the clashes , and reports said that ali riza beheshti , the closest aide to opposition leader mir hossein mousavi , and former foreign minister ebrahim yazdi were also detained early on monday .
the deaths were the first such fatalities in the country since violent street protests erupted there following the disputed re-election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad in june , which saw as many as 70 people die .
according to the web site kaleme , an adviser to mousavi confirmed the death of mousavi 's nephew in the clashes .
the web site quoted the adviser as saying , " i express my regrets and deep condolences over the martyrdom of your nephew ali habibi mousavi on sunday . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 28.12.2009 four hills tournament promises high-flying skiing action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four hills competition is the most prestigious event in the winter sports calendar one of the most prestigious winter sports events , the four hills tournament , kicks off on tuesday in the german resort of oberstdorf .
the week-long tournament showcases the best of alpine ski jumping . the german delegation at the week-long four hills tournament got off to a good start - all seven competitors made it through qualification of the first event - but grabbing a spot on the podium in the ski-jumping festival will be like skiing into the wind . the tournament , taking place for the 58th time , brings together the world 's best ski jumpers for the highlight of alpine skiing .
the ski jumpers compete at four sites in germany and austria to usher in the new year , and the skier with the best combined results at the end of all four competitions is the winner . veteran competitor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmitt downplays his chances at the four hills while this year 's favorites are switzerland 's simon ammann and austria 's gregor schlierenzauer , germany 's best chance at a medal will come from either pascal bodmer or martin schmitt - two skiers at opposite ends of their careers who may learn a thing or two from each other . schmitt is a well-known figure in the world of ski jumping .
at the 2002 olympic games in salt lake city in the united states , schmitt took gold with the german k120 team and was the runner-up in last season 's world championships . however , as schmitt approaches his 32nd birthday in january , he admits that his sights are set a bit lower for the four hills tournament . " i 'm pretty sure i 'm not competing as one of the favorites , " schmitt told the german sports news agency sid .
" way up at the front it looks a little bleak -lsb- for him -rsb- . " roomies although schmitt might not be a medal contender , his presence at the four hills could rub off on one of his teammates . schmitt 's roommate for the first competition in obertsdorf is pascal bodmer , an up-and-comer on the german team and its best shot at a medal .
schmitt says the youngster , who turns 19 next week , is a very calm and collected roommate , especially before a competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal bodmer is in his second four hills tournament " normally before i compete i 'm antsy and running around the room , " schmitt told the german news agency dpa .
" but he 's sitting in bed , totally calm , saying ' you 've still got time . " ' this will be bodmer 's second four hills tournament , and while his expectations are higher than the first time -lrb- " last year it was just important to be in the tournament " -rrb- , he 's still got to beat out the likes of ammann and schlierenzauer for a chance at a medal . competition from across the border switzerland 's ammann maintains an edge with three victories on the world cup circuit this season already under his belt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon ammann , far left , with last year 's winner wolfgang loitzl , center and finland 's harri olli the two-time gold medalist from the 2002 olympics is hoping to become the first swiss winner of the four hills . last year , he came a disappointing eighth place in the third round of the four hills at innsbruck , which ended his hopes of winning the prestigious title . he 'll face stiff competition from the much younger schlierenzauer . the 19-year-old austrian ski jumper has already chalked up 26 world cup wins .
and he came third in last year 's four hills event . " i am in form , i 'm in a hurry to take part in the four hills , " schlierenzauer said . the four hills contest has a tradition of producing surprise winners .
last year , austria 's wolfgang loitzl clinched three victories and a second place to storm to four hills victory . from oberstdorf , the four hills tournament moves on to garmisch-partenkirchen , and then to the austrian resorts of innsbruck and bischofshofen . mz / sp / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
