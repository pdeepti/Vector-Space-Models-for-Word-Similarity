program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 29.03.2009 celebrations mark 90 years of bauhaus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus masters in a group photo bauhaus , the modern design movement that originated in the eastern german city of weimar , marks its 90th birthday on april 1 .
celebrations will include a special exhibition at the city 's bauhaus museum . bauhaus might be turning 90 , but for enthusiasts of the german design movement , the art , furniture and architecture it inspired still looks fresh and young .
the school was founded in 1919 by architect walter gropius , who wanted to create something bold and forward-thinking in the wake of world war i , which he described as a " catastrophe of world history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus classics designed by marcel breuer and ludwig mies van der rohe gropius was 35 when he applied to the city of weimar to establish an academy there .
by the time he received his permit , he 'd penned a manifesto which would prove to be the beginning of an aesthetic upheaval that would reach far beyond germany 's borders .
in a pamphlet he wrote for an april 1919 exhibition entitled " exhibition of unknown architects , " gropius described his goal as being " to create a new guild of craftsmen , without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist . "
he argued that a new era had begun with the end of the war , and he wanted a new architectural style to reflect this .
crucially , he advocated architecture and consumer goods that were functional , inexpensive and consistent with the industrialization and mass production that was changing the face of europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus buildings in dessau , shown here , and weimar are unesco world heritage sites the school existed in three german cities : weimar -lrb- 1919 -1925 -rrb- , dessau -lrb- 1925 - 1932 -rrb- and berlin -lrb- 1932 - 1933 -rrb- .
in 1933 , it was closed by the nazi regime .
during its years of operation , the school attracted avant garde artists such as wassily kandinsky , paul klee and lyonel feininger .
along with gropius , hannes meyer and ludwig mies van der rohe acted as architect-directors .
bauhaus spirit lives on but although the original bauhaus school had a relatively short lifespan , the bauhaus principles and aesthetic have lived on and served as the inspiration for more schools of design , particularly in the united states , where many of those associated with the bauhaus movement settled in the 1930s .
today , the bauhaus school is called the bauhaus university of weimar .
although weimar is commonly seen as the cradle of great german literary figures such as goethe and schiller , the popularity of bauhaus has also contributed to the city becoming a popular tourist destination in recent years .
many designers are taking the 90th anniversary as an occasion to bring remakes of bauhaus classics to the market .
at the interior design trade show ambiente in mid-february in frankfurt , a number of porcelain and glassmakers showed variations of designs that originated at the bauhaus school .
examples include tea sets by kpm in berlin and by rosenthal in selb .
gropius designed the tac collection in 1969 for rosenthal , which is offering the set in the bauhaus colors of blue , yellow and red to mark the anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamps in the bauhaus style a highlight of the bauhaus anniversary week celebrations in weimar will be the 11th international bauhaus colloquium featuring architectural experts from around the world debating the political and ethical challenges of globalization , and how architecture responds to them .
the bauhaus colloquia are highly-regarded conferences on architectural theory and have been held regularly since 1976 .
meanwhile , weimar is already looking ahead a decade to the bauhaus centenary , and plans to open a new museum dedicated to the movement in 2019 . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the school was founded in 1919 by architect walter gropius , who wanted to create something bold and forward-thinking in the wake of world war i , which he described as a " catastrophe of world history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus classics designed by marcel breuer and ludwig mies van der rohe gropius was 35 when he applied to the city of weimar to establish an academy there .
by the time he received his permit , he 'd penned a manifesto which would prove to be the beginning of an aesthetic upheaval that would reach far beyond germany 's borders .
in a pamphlet he wrote for an april 1919 exhibition entitled " exhibition of unknown architects , " gropius described his goal as being " to create a new guild of craftsmen , without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist . "
he argued that a new era had begun with the end of the war , and he wanted a new architectural style to reflect this .
crucially , he advocated architecture and consumer goods that were functional , inexpensive and consistent with the industrialization and mass production that was changing the face of europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus buildings in dessau , shown here , and weimar are unesco world heritage sites the school existed in three german cities : weimar -lrb- 1919 -1925 -rrb- , dessau -lrb- 1925 - 1932 -rrb- and berlin -lrb- 1932 - 1933 -rrb- .
in 1933 , it was closed by the nazi regime .
during its years of operation , the school attracted avant garde artists such as wassily kandinsky , paul klee and lyonel feininger .
along with gropius , hannes meyer and ludwig mies van der rohe acted as architect-directors .
bauhaus spirit lives on but although the original bauhaus school had a relatively short lifespan , the bauhaus principles and aesthetic have lived on and served as the inspiration for more schools of design , particularly in the united states , where many of those associated with the bauhaus movement settled in the 1930s .
today , the bauhaus school is called the bauhaus university of weimar .
although weimar is commonly seen as the cradle of great german literary figures such as goethe and schiller , the popularity of bauhaus has also contributed to the city becoming a popular tourist destination in recent years .
many designers are taking the 90th anniversary as an occasion to bring remakes of bauhaus classics to the market .
at the interior design trade show ambiente in mid-february in frankfurt , a number of porcelain and glassmakers showed variations of designs that originated at the bauhaus school .
examples include tea sets by kpm in berlin and by rosenthal in selb .
gropius designed the tac collection in 1969 for rosenthal , which is offering the set in the bauhaus colors of blue , yellow and red to mark the anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamps in the bauhaus style a highlight of the bauhaus anniversary week celebrations in weimar will be the 11th international bauhaus colloquium featuring architectural experts from around the world debating the political and ethical challenges of globalization , and how architecture responds to them .
the bauhaus colloquia are highly-regarded conferences on architectural theory and have been held regularly since 1976 .

" the cooperative project lohafex has yielded new insights on how ocean ecosystems function , " the awi said in statement published earlier this week . " but it has dampened hopes on the potential of the southern ocean to sequester significant amounts of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- and thus mitigate global warming . " simple idea , complex issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polarstern is the most important tool in germany 's polar research program the team set sail from cape town on the polarstern vessel in january and spent two and half months conducting the geo-engineering experiment . the idea behind iron fertilization was simple .
algae living at the ocean surface have plenty of nutrients but are starved of iron .
sprinkle iron dust on the water and they reproduce rapidly , absorbing carbon dioxide from the surface water . at the end of their life cycle the algae die and sink .
most of the carbon would thus end up in deep water or on the sea bottom . the ocean would absorb more carbon dioxide from the air , reducing the greenhouse effect .
sequestering carbon this was thought to be a possible strategy against global warming . similar projects , however , have been heavily criticized by environmentalist groups for failing to address the human behavior that causes global warming and for having the potential to change the ecosystem in unforeseen ways . other geo-engineering ideas include sowing sulphur particles in the stratosphere to reflect solar radiation and erecting mirrors in orbit that would deflect sunrays and thus slightly cool the planet . sms / tt / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 29.03.2009 anti-doping agency takes fifa , uefa to task over testing rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa and uefa argue that a new anti-doping rule is too invasive the chief of the world anti-doping agency has accused fifa and uefa of ignoring the reality of doping after the soccer associations rejected tighter drug testing rules . " one of the key principles of efficient doping control is the surprise effect and the possibility to test an athlete without advance notice on a 365 day basis , " the world anti doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- president john fahey said on wednesday , march 25 , in a statement explaining the rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa chief platini -lrb- left -rrb- and fifa president blatter rejected the rule " alleging , as fifa and uefa do , that testing should only take place at training grounds and not during holiday periods , ignores the reality of doping in sport , " fahey said .
" experience has demonstrated that athletes who cheat seize every opportunity to do so and dope when they believe they wo n't be tested . "
fifa and uefa have taken issue with the rule implemented in january that requires elite athletes to indicate their whereabouts on a chosen one-hour period every day , seven days a week .
the soccer bodies have argued that this rule is too invasive , insisting that " the fundamental differences between an individual athlete , who trains on his own ... and a team-sport athlete , who is present at the stadium six days out of seven , and thus easy to locate , " must be taken into account .
they formally rejected the " whereabouts rule , " calling instead for " collective location rules , within the scope of the team . "
unfair policy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa and fifa : leave soccer stars , like david beckham , alone when they 're on vacation uefa chief michel platini and fifa president sepp blatter insist that the new rules are perceived as unfair by many sport associations .
" this is not just the line taken by soccer , but of all the team sports , basketball , handball , volleyball and rugby , " blatter said recently .
but the anti-doping agency said that it did in fact allow teams to submit the location of their players collectively and maintained that only fifa and uefa were disputing the rule .
" wada stakeholders have recognized this reality , and the feedback we have received from the overwhelming majority of other sports , but also from athletes and all those who support doping-free sport , strongly contradicts fifa 's and uefa 's stance , " fahey said .
blatter however put the focus on respecting player 's free time , saying that although the soccer federations are jointly combating doping , it should not turn into a " witch hunt . "
" i do n't want a fight , i just want them to understand , " blatter said .
platini echoed this sentiment of protecting players .
" footballers ca n't be under control 365 days a year , " he said .
" we ask simply that players be left in peace when they are spending their holidays with their families . " ls / tt / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 g20 leaders planning revamp of market regulations at london summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 hopes to bring world financial markets into line the world 's biggest economic powers are expected to agree next week on an urgent revamp of market regulations , helping them to smooth over a rift about the need for new public spending to combat the global recession . indeed , the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- landmark summit of the world 's richest and emerging economies in london is likely to sign off on plans to bring world financial controls into line with the changes unleashed by fast-paced globalization by stepping up coordinated market supervision and closing off gaps in the regulatory system .
the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .
g8 ministers meet to discuss " human dimension " meanwhile in rome on sunday , labor ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- and six other major economies gathered for talks on the " human dimension " of the financial crisis sweeping the planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment is rising around the world due ´ to the crisis the three-day " group of 14 " meeting will bring together the g8 leading industrial powers with the emerging giants china , india and brazil as well as mexico , south africa and egypt at a time when worldwide job losses are sparking fears of social unrest .
the g14 " social summit " in rome will urge the g20 to put " people first " as they discuss economic recovery strategies and reforms to the financial regulatory system , italian labour minister maurizio sacconi said .
sacconi said the g14 would advocate a " global pact " to ensure sustainable social protections , investment in people , notably skills development , and job creation , especially in the areas of environmental protection , health and education .
imf chief dominique strauss-kahn warned last week that " dramatic " rises in unemployment around the world would set the stage for conflict .
social unrest fears gather credence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests , like this one in paris , have been peaceful so far the world financial crisis could spark " social unrest , some threats to democracy and maybe for some cases , it can also end in war , " he warned during an international labour organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- meeting in geneva .

the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .
g8 ministers meet to discuss " human dimension " meanwhile in rome on sunday , labor ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- and six other major economies gathered for talks on the " human dimension " of the financial crisis sweeping the planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment is rising around the world due ´ to the crisis the three-day " group of 14 " meeting will bring together the g8 leading industrial powers with the emerging giants china , india and brazil as well as mexico , south africa and egypt at a time when worldwide job losses are sparking fears of social unrest .
the g14 " social summit " in rome will urge the g20 to put " people first " as they discuss economic recovery strategies and reforms to the financial regulatory system , italian labour minister maurizio sacconi said .
sacconi said the g14 would advocate a " global pact " to ensure sustainable social protections , investment in people , notably skills development , and job creation , especially in the areas of environmental protection , health and education .
imf chief dominique strauss-kahn warned last week that " dramatic " rises in unemployment around the world would set the stage for conflict .
social unrest fears gather credence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests , like this one in paris , have been peaceful so far the world financial crisis could spark " social unrest , some threats to democracy and maybe for some cases , it can also end in war , " he warned during an international labour organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- meeting in geneva .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 g20 leaders planning revamp of market regulations at london summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 hopes to bring world financial markets into line the world 's biggest economic powers are expected to agree next week on an urgent revamp of market regulations , helping them to smooth over a rift about the need for new public spending to combat the global recession . indeed , the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- landmark summit of the world 's richest and emerging economies in london is likely to sign off on plans to bring world financial controls into line with the changes unleashed by fast-paced globalization by stepping up coordinated market supervision and closing off gaps in the regulatory system .
the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .
g8 ministers meet to discuss " human dimension " meanwhile in rome on sunday , labor ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- and six other major economies gathered for talks on the " human dimension " of the financial crisis sweeping the planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment is rising around the world due ´ to the crisis the three-day " group of 14 " meeting will bring together the g8 leading industrial powers with the emerging giants china , india and brazil as well as mexico , south africa and egypt at a time when worldwide job losses are sparking fears of social unrest .
the g14 " social summit " in rome will urge the g20 to put " people first " as they discuss economic recovery strategies and reforms to the financial regulatory system , italian labour minister maurizio sacconi said .
sacconi said the g14 would advocate a " global pact " to ensure sustainable social protections , investment in people , notably skills development , and job creation , especially in the areas of environmental protection , health and education .
imf chief dominique strauss-kahn warned last week that " dramatic " rises in unemployment around the world would set the stage for conflict .

marcell jansen , bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski got the other goals .
germany top group 4 with 13 points from five games ahead of russia , who have nine from four games .
only the group winner qualifies directly for the 2010 finals in south africa .
" we have fulfilled our duty , " said germany coach joachim loew .
" we had expected liechtenstein would defend with nine or ten men .
obviously , we would have liked to have scored a few more goals , but i am quite content . "
liechtenstein coach hans-peter zaugg admitted afterwards this was a good result for them and germany 's stars had expected more goals .
liechtenstein goalkeeper peter jehle said : " i am a little disappointed how we conceded the goals early in each half .
we made life too easy for the germans but in the end we played a decent match . "
loew had to make several changes due to injuries concerning among others striker miroslav klose , midfielder torsten frings and defender arne friedrich .
tsg hoffenheim defender andreas beck started for a first time and hanover 's robert enke returned between the posts from a hand fracture .
germany were determined from the start to make up for home defeats against england and norway in their last two -lrb- friendly -rrb- matches , with mario gomez heading wide just 16 seconds into the game .
chelsea midfielder ballack broke the deadlock in the fourth minute with a stunning volley high into the net off schweinsteiger 's cross .
just five minutes later sv hamburg 's jansen doubled the lead on the rebound from podolski 's shot saved which had been saved by jehle .
avalanche of goals fails to materialize the fans naturally hoped for plenty goals but the germans then showed a lack of precision until the break , and the second half passed in identical fashion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweini added a goal to give germany a 3-0 lead schweinsteiger made victory secure when he scored the third goal in the 48th when he hit the empty net after an initial shot from his bayern munich team-mate podolski , who then found the net himself two minutes later .
enke had to make only one save , in the 54th against mario frick , while up front most notably vfb stuttgart forward mario gomez failed to score as his germany drought now covers almost one year .
germany next visit wales , 2-0 losers against finland saturday , on wednesday .
the same day liechtenstein host russia .
" i am pleased with the victory , but now much harder tasks lie ahead for us , " said ballack whose side face russia next october in moscow in the game which is likely to decide the group .

the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .
g8 ministers meet to discuss " human dimension " meanwhile in rome on sunday , labor ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- and six other major economies gathered for talks on the " human dimension " of the financial crisis sweeping the planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment is rising around the world due ´ to the crisis the three-day " group of 14 " meeting will bring together the g8 leading industrial powers with the emerging giants china , india and brazil as well as mexico , south africa and egypt at a time when worldwide job losses are sparking fears of social unrest .
the g14 " social summit " in rome will urge the g20 to put " people first " as they discuss economic recovery strategies and reforms to the financial regulatory system , italian labour minister maurizio sacconi said .
sacconi said the g14 would advocate a " global pact " to ensure sustainable social protections , investment in people , notably skills development , and job creation , especially in the areas of environmental protection , health and education .
imf chief dominique strauss-kahn warned last week that " dramatic " rises in unemployment around the world would set the stage for conflict .
social unrest fears gather credence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests , like this one in paris , have been peaceful so far the world financial crisis could spark " social unrest , some threats to democracy and maybe for some cases , it can also end in war , " he warned during an international labour organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- meeting in geneva .
the ilo in january said the global financial meltdown could claim up to 50 million jobs over 2008 and 2009 , while the world bank warned that the crisis could push 46 million back into poverty .
ilo chief juan somavia will stress in rome " that we are confronting an inter-connected financial , economic and social crisis , and that the attention of policy makers should turn to the three crises at the same time , " his deputy philippe egger said last week .
tens of thousands of people demonstrated in london , rome , berlin and other cities on saturday to express their anger at the human cost of the financial crisis .
organizers of the put people first march for " jobs , justice and climate " in london had rejected as " smears " claims in police briefings that marches could be hijacked by anarchists bent on violence .
france last week saw more than a million workers take to the streets in a nationwide strike to force president sarkozy to boost wages and protect jobs .

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .

these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .
" the clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead , " de boer said .
all eyes on the us the united states ' position will be keenly observed in the coming days , since washington recently changed tack on climate change with the inauguration of president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us climate envoy todd stern former us president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , but it was never ratified .
the white house on saturday invited the un and 16 major economies to washington to prepare for international efforts to reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions .
" the us will be powerfully and fervently engaged in this process , " obama 's climate negotiator , todd stern said on sunday .
but he cautioned against unrealistic expectations that the united states could " wave a magic wand " and find solutions to all problems .
" i do n't think anybody should be thinking that the us can ride in on a white horse and make it all work , " he said .
the chinese puzzle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is a major greenhouse gas emitter in particular , washington wants to see china increase its commitment to emissions reduction , since the country 's economic growth made it one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors .
china and the us between them account for more than 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions .
" if you do the math , you simply can not be anywhere near where science tells us we need to be if you do n't have china involved , as well also other major developing countries , " he said .
the kyoto protocol was lenient on developing countries such as china , india and brazil .
this is to change in the document to be signed in copenhagen .
de boer welcomed obama 's initiative , saying it could be " useful " to find a political solution to the climate change talks . tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 g20 leaders planning revamp of market regulations at london summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 hopes to bring world financial markets into line the world 's biggest economic powers are expected to agree next week on an urgent revamp of market regulations , helping them to smooth over a rift about the need for new public spending to combat the global recession . indeed , the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- landmark summit of the world 's richest and emerging economies in london is likely to sign off on plans to bring world financial controls into line with the changes unleashed by fast-paced globalization by stepping up coordinated market supervision and closing off gaps in the regulatory system .
the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .
g8 ministers meet to discuss " human dimension " meanwhile in rome on sunday , labor ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- and six other major economies gathered for talks on the " human dimension " of the financial crisis sweeping the planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment is rising around the world due ´ to the crisis the three-day " group of 14 " meeting will bring together the g8 leading industrial powers with the emerging giants china , india and brazil as well as mexico , south africa and egypt at a time when worldwide job losses are sparking fears of social unrest .
the g14 " social summit " in rome will urge the g20 to put " people first " as they discuss economic recovery strategies and reforms to the financial regulatory system , italian labour minister maurizio sacconi said .
sacconi said the g14 would advocate a " global pact " to ensure sustainable social protections , investment in people , notably skills development , and job creation , especially in the areas of environmental protection , health and education .
imf chief dominique strauss-kahn warned last week that " dramatic " rises in unemployment around the world would set the stage for conflict .
social unrest fears gather credence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests , like this one in paris , have been peaceful so far the world financial crisis could spark " social unrest , some threats to democracy and maybe for some cases , it can also end in war , " he warned during an international labour organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- meeting in geneva .
the ilo in january said the global financial meltdown could claim up to 50 million jobs over 2008 and 2009 , while the world bank warned that the crisis could push 46 million back into poverty .
ilo chief juan somavia will stress in rome " that we are confronting an inter-connected financial , economic and social crisis , and that the attention of policy makers should turn to the three crises at the same time , " his deputy philippe egger said last week .
tens of thousands of people demonstrated in london , rome , berlin and other cities on saturday to express their anger at the human cost of the financial crisis .
organizers of the put people first march for " jobs , justice and climate " in london had rejected as " smears " claims in police briefings that marches could be hijacked by anarchists bent on violence .
france last week saw more than a million workers take to the streets in a nationwide strike to force president sarkozy to boost wages and protect jobs .
a protest in paris left nine police officers injured and led to some 300 arrests . nda / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 371 landmarks powered down worldwide , including the eiffel tower , niagara falls , the las vegas casino strip and beijing 's " bird 's nest " olympic stadium .
the switch-off ended in honolulu , capital of the us state of hawaii .
residents of the chatham islands , a territory of new zealand in the southern pacific ocean , turned off light switches and kicked off the global earth hour .
one of the event 's dramatic episodes occurred in sydney , where the iconic opera house and harbour bridge plunged into darkness on saturday night , killing their lights for an hour .
millions of people turned out in sydney , while melbourne , australia 's second-largest city , came to life with a pedal-powered concert and others enjoyed moonlit picnics and barbecues .
the global grassroots movement began in sydney two years ago , when 2.2 million people switched off their lights .
earth hour has since grown to include 3,929 cities , villages and localities across the globe .
" it is a very positive , hopeful campaign , " andy ridley , the event 's director , told reporters in sydney .
" we want people to think , even if it is for an hour , what they can do to lower their carbon footprint and take that beyond the hour . "
organizers send message to world leaders ridley said he was aiming for one billion participants , hoping the event would send a resounding message to world leaders about significant emissions cuts .
scientists have warned that global warming caused by burning fossil fuels on a massive scale could devastate the planet , hitting the poorest countries hardest with floods , droughts and disease .
sceptics criticized the event as little more than empty symbolism , with danish professor bjorn lomborg claiming the use of candles during the hour could produce more emissions than electric lights .
but united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a video message earlier this month that " earth hour is a way for the citizens of the world to send a clear message .
they want action on climate change . "
lights in the " city that never sleeps " began going dark at 8:30 pm -lrb- 0130 cet -rrb- at some of new york city 's most renowned buildings and landmarks , including broadway theaters , the empire state building , the chrysler building and the signs of several big firms , including coca-cola 's in times square .
in washington , campuses of major universities and several embassies flipped the switch .
people gathered at freedom plaza , which has an unobstructed view of the us congress , to watch the lights dim on nearby buildings and hotels .
iconic structures plunged into darkness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden gate bridge added its weight to the message in london , the lights went off at the houses of parliament and the famous electronic billboard at piccadilly circus .
in paris , hundreds of monuments and buildings , from the louvre and notre dame cathedral to the arc de triomphe , all went dark .
for safety reasons , the lights on the eiffel tower were switched off for only five minutes .
elsewhere across europe , st peter 's basilica in rome and the greek parliament in athens were all plunged into darkness , while entertainers danced in front of the romanian parliament in bucharest .
in egypt , the giza pyramids , the cairo tower and the alexandria library on the mediterranean all went dark .
in the united arab emirates , which has the highest per capita energy consumption in the world , dubai 's iconic sail-shaped seven-star burj al arab hotel turned off its nightly multi-colored light show .
the lights went dark in downtown manila , as they did in the world 's tallest completed skyscraper , the taipei 101 building .
in south africa , table mountain was to be seen only by starlight for an hour .
and the weekender newspaper reported that one couple would turn the lights down on their marriage at a vineyard near cape town .
the event ended in honolulu , where municipal buildings darkened for the second consecutive year to mark the eco-friendly hour , according to local news reports .

washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .

white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .

the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .

the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .
g8 ministers meet to discuss " human dimension " meanwhile in rome on sunday , labor ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- and six other major economies gathered for talks on the " human dimension " of the financial crisis sweeping the planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment is rising around the world due ´ to the crisis the three-day " group of 14 " meeting will bring together the g8 leading industrial powers with the emerging giants china , india and brazil as well as mexico , south africa and egypt at a time when worldwide job losses are sparking fears of social unrest .
the g14 " social summit " in rome will urge the g20 to put " people first " as they discuss economic recovery strategies and reforms to the financial regulatory system , italian labour minister maurizio sacconi said .
sacconi said the g14 would advocate a " global pact " to ensure sustainable social protections , investment in people , notably skills development , and job creation , especially in the areas of environmental protection , health and education .
imf chief dominique strauss-kahn warned last week that " dramatic " rises in unemployment around the world would set the stage for conflict .
social unrest fears gather credence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests , like this one in paris , have been peaceful so far the world financial crisis could spark " social unrest , some threats to democracy and maybe for some cases , it can also end in war , " he warned during an international labour organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- meeting in geneva .
the ilo in january said the global financial meltdown could claim up to 50 million jobs over 2008 and 2009 , while the world bank warned that the crisis could push 46 million back into poverty .
ilo chief juan somavia will stress in rome " that we are confronting an inter-connected financial , economic and social crisis , and that the attention of policy makers should turn to the three crises at the same time , " his deputy philippe egger said last week .
tens of thousands of people demonstrated in london , rome , berlin and other cities on saturday to express their anger at the human cost of the financial crisis .
organizers of the put people first march for " jobs , justice and climate " in london had rejected as " smears " claims in police briefings that marches could be hijacked by anarchists bent on violence .
france last week saw more than a million workers take to the streets in a nationwide strike to force president sarkozy to boost wages and protect jobs .

in the long term however , the german government bank bailout agency soffin is to take complete control of the bank , hre said .
soffin is to purchase 20 million shares at a price of three euros each , granting a 60-million-euro -lrb- $ 80.1-million -rrb- capital injection to hre .
the current shareholders will initially remain on board .
" -lrb- soffin -rrb- intends to take action to stabilize hypo real estate group , in the interest of stabilizing the financial markets , " soffin said .
" soffin will implement measures to achieve a sufficient recapitalization " of hre , the statement added .
however , the prerequisite for soffin to stabilize the ailing bank is said to be a complete state takeover , either through the bailout fund or by direct government intervention .
" to this end it is intended to make use of the options that will be provided by the german financial markets stabilization amendment act , which is currently being discussed in the legislative process , " a statement on the bank 's website said .
the act , which specifies the conditions for a state expropriation of hre , has been approved by germany 's lower house of parliament .
state ministers are expected to grant their approval in an upper house consultation due friday .
berlin moves to avert catastrophic bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doomed lehman brothers could have brought down hre berlin is concerned that the failure of hre could have catastrophic consequences similar to those sparked by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september , which hit financial markets around the world .
the head of hre said sunday the state 's purchase of the 8.7 percent stake in the bank would allow it to survive despite expected losses for the next two years .
chief executive axel wieandt hailed the government 's purchase of 20 million shares as " good news . "
" with the proposed long-term liquidity and capital support , the federal republic ... has put in place the necessary requirements for hre to continue , " wieandt said in a statement .
" we welcome this step .
it is in the interests of the company and clearly good news , " he added .
the purchase of hre shares - at the minimum legal price of three euros per share - is an " important signal , an important first step , " he said .
" the stabilization and rescue of hre must succeed .
it is in everyone 's interests , " the chief executive stressed .
however , he acknowledged that the bank expected to be " in a loss situation for at least the next two years . "
" nevertheless , we see our medium-term strategic prospects as positive , " he said .
hre announces hefty losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre 's wieandt was understandably pleased hre also released its unaudited earnings statement for 2008 , reporting a hefty net loss of 5.46 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.25 billion -rrb- due largely to write-downs on intangible assets .
" this result very much reflects the difficult situation on the capital and financing markets , " the bank said in the earnings statement .
the pre-tax loss was 5.375 billion , it said , compared to pre-tax profits of 862 million euros in 2007 .
it said hre expected to make losses until at least 2011 .
" the financial year 2008 reflects the impact of the general crisis on the international financial markets and the specific extremely difficult situation for the hypo real estate group , " wieandt , said in a statement .
hre said in its earnings statement that complex " derivative " investments with lehman brothers had been the main cause of a 150-million-euro expense on its own balance sheet .
it said it was also hit by losses linked to icelandic banks , which were largely wiped out by the financial crisis last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : g20 summit in london can europe help developing countries out of the crisis ?
germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 eu aims to present united front at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can 27 nations really march in one direction ?
after refining its economic positions at a recent summit , the eu seems ready to present a united front at the upcoming g20 talks in london .
but some issues are still being fought over within the 27-member bloc . at a summit in brussels on march 20 , the eu member states agreed on an extra 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , as well as a further 25 billion euros in emergency credit for eastern europe .
with that , the union appeared to have aligned the position it would take at the upcoming g20 summit in london on april 2 .
going by the words of french president nicolas sarkozy at the latest eu summit , it would seem that the european union is marching to london in step as one unit .
" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

" soffin will implement measures to achieve a sufficient recapitalization " of hre , the statement added .
however , the prerequisite for soffin to stabilize the ailing bank is said to be a complete state takeover , either through the bailout fund or by direct government intervention .
" to this end it is intended to make use of the options that will be provided by the german financial markets stabilization amendment act , which is currently being discussed in the legislative process , " a statement on the bank 's website said .
the act , which specifies the conditions for a state expropriation of hre , has been approved by germany 's lower house of parliament .
state ministers are expected to grant their approval in an upper house consultation due friday .
berlin moves to avert catastrophic bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doomed lehman brothers could have brought down hre berlin is concerned that the failure of hre could have catastrophic consequences similar to those sparked by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september , which hit financial markets around the world .
the head of hre said sunday the state 's purchase of the 8.7 percent stake in the bank would allow it to survive despite expected losses for the next two years .
chief executive axel wieandt hailed the government 's purchase of 20 million shares as " good news . "
" with the proposed long-term liquidity and capital support , the federal republic ... has put in place the necessary requirements for hre to continue , " wieandt said in a statement .
" we welcome this step .
it is in the interests of the company and clearly good news , " he added .
the purchase of hre shares - at the minimum legal price of three euros per share - is an " important signal , an important first step , " he said .
" the stabilization and rescue of hre must succeed .
it is in everyone 's interests , " the chief executive stressed .
however , he acknowledged that the bank expected to be " in a loss situation for at least the next two years . "
" nevertheless , we see our medium-term strategic prospects as positive , " he said .
hre announces hefty losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre 's wieandt was understandably pleased hre also released its unaudited earnings statement for 2008 , reporting a hefty net loss of 5.46 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.25 billion -rrb- due largely to write-downs on intangible assets .
" this result very much reflects the difficult situation on the capital and financing markets , " the bank said in the earnings statement .
the pre-tax loss was 5.375 billion , it said , compared to pre-tax profits of 862 million euros in 2007 .
it said hre expected to make losses until at least 2011 .
" the financial year 2008 reflects the impact of the general crisis on the international financial markets and the specific extremely difficult situation for the hypo real estate group , " wieandt , said in a statement .
hre said in its earnings statement that complex " derivative " investments with lehman brothers had been the main cause of a 150-million-euro expense on its own balance sheet .
it said it was also hit by losses linked to icelandic banks , which were largely wiped out by the financial crisis last year .
hre has already benefited from more than 100 billion euros in private and public aid to keep it afloat . nda / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .
" the clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead , " de boer said .

" the us will be powerfully and fervently engaged in this process , " obama 's climate negotiator , todd stern said on sunday .

" if you do the math , you simply can not be anywhere near where science tells us we need to be if you do n't have china involved , as well also other major developing countries , " he said .
the kyoto protocol was lenient on developing countries such as china , india and brazil .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 g20 leaders planning revamp of market regulations at london summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 hopes to bring world financial markets into line the world 's biggest economic powers are expected to agree next week on an urgent revamp of market regulations , helping them to smooth over a rift about the need for new public spending to combat the global recession . indeed , the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- landmark summit of the world 's richest and emerging economies in london is likely to sign off on plans to bring world financial controls into line with the changes unleashed by fast-paced globalization by stepping up coordinated market supervision and closing off gaps in the regulatory system .
the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .
g8 ministers meet to discuss " human dimension " meanwhile in rome on sunday , labor ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- and six other major economies gathered for talks on the " human dimension " of the financial crisis sweeping the planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment is rising around the world due ´ to the crisis the three-day " group of 14 " meeting will bring together the g8 leading industrial powers with the emerging giants china , india and brazil as well as mexico , south africa and egypt at a time when worldwide job losses are sparking fears of social unrest .
the g14 " social summit " in rome will urge the g20 to put " people first " as they discuss economic recovery strategies and reforms to the financial regulatory system , italian labour minister maurizio sacconi said .
sacconi said the g14 would advocate a " global pact " to ensure sustainable social protections , investment in people , notably skills development , and job creation , especially in the areas of environmental protection , health and education .
imf chief dominique strauss-kahn warned last week that " dramatic " rises in unemployment around the world would set the stage for conflict .
social unrest fears gather credence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests , like this one in paris , have been peaceful so far the world financial crisis could spark " social unrest , some threats to democracy and maybe for some cases , it can also end in war , " he warned during an international labour organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- meeting in geneva .
the ilo in january said the global financial meltdown could claim up to 50 million jobs over 2008 and 2009 , while the world bank warned that the crisis could push 46 million back into poverty .
ilo chief juan somavia will stress in rome " that we are confronting an inter-connected financial , economic and social crisis , and that the attention of policy makers should turn to the three crises at the same time , " his deputy philippe egger said last week .
tens of thousands of people demonstrated in london , rome , berlin and other cities on saturday to express their anger at the human cost of the financial crisis .
organizers of the put people first march for " jobs , justice and climate " in london had rejected as " smears " claims in police briefings that marches could be hijacked by anarchists bent on violence .
france last week saw more than a million workers take to the streets in a nationwide strike to force president sarkozy to boost wages and protect jobs .

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .
" the clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead , " de boer said .
all eyes on the us the united states ' position will be keenly observed in the coming days , since washington recently changed tack on climate change with the inauguration of president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us climate envoy todd stern former us president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , but it was never ratified .
the white house on saturday invited the un and 16 major economies to washington to prepare for international efforts to reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions .
" the us will be powerfully and fervently engaged in this process , " obama 's climate negotiator , todd stern said on sunday .
but he cautioned against unrealistic expectations that the united states could " wave a magic wand " and find solutions to all problems .
" i do n't think anybody should be thinking that the us can ride in on a white horse and make it all work , " he said .
the chinese puzzle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is a major greenhouse gas emitter in particular , washington wants to see china increase its commitment to emissions reduction , since the country 's economic growth made it one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors .
china and the us between them account for more than 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions .
" if you do the math , you simply can not be anywhere near where science tells us we need to be if you do n't have china involved , as well also other major developing countries , " he said .
the kyoto protocol was lenient on developing countries such as china , india and brazil .
this is to change in the document to be signed in copenhagen .
de boer welcomed obama 's initiative , saying it could be " useful " to find a political solution to the climate change talks . tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the long term however , the german government bank bailout agency soffin is to take complete control of the bank , hre said .
soffin is to purchase 20 million shares at a price of three euros each , granting a 60-million-euro -lrb- $ 80.1-million -rrb- capital injection to hre .
the current shareholders will initially remain on board .
" -lrb- soffin -rrb- intends to take action to stabilize hypo real estate group , in the interest of stabilizing the financial markets , " soffin said .
" soffin will implement measures to achieve a sufficient recapitalization " of hre , the statement added .
however , the prerequisite for soffin to stabilize the ailing bank is said to be a complete state takeover , either through the bailout fund or by direct government intervention .
" to this end it is intended to make use of the options that will be provided by the german financial markets stabilization amendment act , which is currently being discussed in the legislative process , " a statement on the bank 's website said .
the act , which specifies the conditions for a state expropriation of hre , has been approved by germany 's lower house of parliament .
state ministers are expected to grant their approval in an upper house consultation due friday .
berlin moves to avert catastrophic bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doomed lehman brothers could have brought down hre berlin is concerned that the failure of hre could have catastrophic consequences similar to those sparked by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september , which hit financial markets around the world .
the head of hre said sunday the state 's purchase of the 8.7 percent stake in the bank would allow it to survive despite expected losses for the next two years .
chief executive axel wieandt hailed the government 's purchase of 20 million shares as " good news . "
" with the proposed long-term liquidity and capital support , the federal republic ... has put in place the necessary requirements for hre to continue , " wieandt said in a statement .
" we welcome this step .
it is in the interests of the company and clearly good news , " he added .
the purchase of hre shares - at the minimum legal price of three euros per share - is an " important signal , an important first step , " he said .
" the stabilization and rescue of hre must succeed .
it is in everyone 's interests , " the chief executive stressed .
however , he acknowledged that the bank expected to be " in a loss situation for at least the next two years . "
" nevertheless , we see our medium-term strategic prospects as positive , " he said .
hre announces hefty losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre 's wieandt was understandably pleased hre also released its unaudited earnings statement for 2008 , reporting a hefty net loss of 5.46 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.25 billion -rrb- due largely to write-downs on intangible assets .
" this result very much reflects the difficult situation on the capital and financing markets , " the bank said in the earnings statement .
the pre-tax loss was 5.375 billion , it said , compared to pre-tax profits of 862 million euros in 2007 .
it said hre expected to make losses until at least 2011 .
" the financial year 2008 reflects the impact of the general crisis on the international financial markets and the specific extremely difficult situation for the hypo real estate group , " wieandt , said in a statement .
hre said in its earnings statement that complex " derivative " investments with lehman brothers had been the main cause of a 150-million-euro expense on its own balance sheet .
it said it was also hit by losses linked to icelandic banks , which were largely wiped out by the financial crisis last year .
hre has already benefited from more than 100 billion euros in private and public aid to keep it afloat . nda / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after refining its economic positions at a recent summit , the eu seems ready to present a united front at the upcoming g20 talks in london .
but some issues are still being fought over within the 27-member bloc . at a summit in brussels on march 20 , the eu member states agreed on an extra 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , as well as a further 25 billion euros in emergency credit for eastern europe .
with that , the union appeared to have aligned the position it would take at the upcoming g20 summit in london on april 2 .
going by the words of french president nicolas sarkozy at the latest eu summit , it would seem that the european union is marching to london in step as one unit .
" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

soffin is to purchase 20 million shares at a price of three euros each , granting a 60-million-euro -lrb- $ 80.1-million -rrb- capital injection to hre .
the current shareholders will initially remain on board .
" -lrb- soffin -rrb- intends to take action to stabilize hypo real estate group , in the interest of stabilizing the financial markets , " soffin said .
" soffin will implement measures to achieve a sufficient recapitalization " of hre , the statement added .

" to this end it is intended to make use of the options that will be provided by the german financial markets stabilization amendment act , which is currently being discussed in the legislative process , " a statement on the bank 's website said .
the act , which specifies the conditions for a state expropriation of hre , has been approved by germany 's lower house of parliament .

it said hre expected to make losses until at least 2011 .
" the financial year 2008 reflects the impact of the general crisis on the international financial markets and the specific extremely difficult situation for the hypo real estate group , " wieandt , said in a statement .
hre said in its earnings statement that complex " derivative " investments with lehman brothers had been the main cause of a 150-million-euro expense on its own balance sheet .

in the long term however , the german government bank bailout agency soffin is to take complete control of the bank , hre said .
soffin is to purchase 20 million shares at a price of three euros each , granting a 60-million-euro -lrb- $ 80.1-million -rrb- capital injection to hre .
the current shareholders will initially remain on board .
" -lrb- soffin -rrb- intends to take action to stabilize hypo real estate group , in the interest of stabilizing the financial markets , " soffin said .
" soffin will implement measures to achieve a sufficient recapitalization " of hre , the statement added .
however , the prerequisite for soffin to stabilize the ailing bank is said to be a complete state takeover , either through the bailout fund or by direct government intervention .
" to this end it is intended to make use of the options that will be provided by the german financial markets stabilization amendment act , which is currently being discussed in the legislative process , " a statement on the bank 's website said .
the act , which specifies the conditions for a state expropriation of hre , has been approved by germany 's lower house of parliament .
state ministers are expected to grant their approval in an upper house consultation due friday .
berlin moves to avert catastrophic bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doomed lehman brothers could have brought down hre berlin is concerned that the failure of hre could have catastrophic consequences similar to those sparked by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september , which hit financial markets around the world .
the head of hre said sunday the state 's purchase of the 8.7 percent stake in the bank would allow it to survive despite expected losses for the next two years .
chief executive axel wieandt hailed the government 's purchase of 20 million shares as " good news . "
" with the proposed long-term liquidity and capital support , the federal republic ... has put in place the necessary requirements for hre to continue , " wieandt said in a statement .
" we welcome this step .
it is in the interests of the company and clearly good news , " he added .
the purchase of hre shares - at the minimum legal price of three euros per share - is an " important signal , an important first step , " he said .
" the stabilization and rescue of hre must succeed .
it is in everyone 's interests , " the chief executive stressed .
however , he acknowledged that the bank expected to be " in a loss situation for at least the next two years . "
" nevertheless , we see our medium-term strategic prospects as positive , " he said .
hre announces hefty losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre 's wieandt was understandably pleased hre also released its unaudited earnings statement for 2008 , reporting a hefty net loss of 5.46 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.25 billion -rrb- due largely to write-downs on intangible assets .
" this result very much reflects the difficult situation on the capital and financing markets , " the bank said in the earnings statement .
the pre-tax loss was 5.375 billion , it said , compared to pre-tax profits of 862 million euros in 2007 .
it said hre expected to make losses until at least 2011 .
" the financial year 2008 reflects the impact of the general crisis on the international financial markets and the specific extremely difficult situation for the hypo real estate group , " wieandt , said in a statement .
hre said in its earnings statement that complex " derivative " investments with lehman brothers had been the main cause of a 150-million-euro expense on its own balance sheet .
it said it was also hit by losses linked to icelandic banks , which were largely wiped out by the financial crisis last year .

some 371 landmarks powered down worldwide , including the eiffel tower , niagara falls , the las vegas casino strip and beijing 's " bird 's nest " olympic stadium .
the switch-off ended in honolulu , capital of the us state of hawaii .
residents of the chatham islands , a territory of new zealand in the southern pacific ocean , turned off light switches and kicked off the global earth hour .
one of the event 's dramatic episodes occurred in sydney , where the iconic opera house and harbour bridge plunged into darkness on saturday night , killing their lights for an hour .
millions of people turned out in sydney , while melbourne , australia 's second-largest city , came to life with a pedal-powered concert and others enjoyed moonlit picnics and barbecues .
the global grassroots movement began in sydney two years ago , when 2.2 million people switched off their lights .
earth hour has since grown to include 3,929 cities , villages and localities across the globe .
" it is a very positive , hopeful campaign , " andy ridley , the event 's director , told reporters in sydney .
" we want people to think , even if it is for an hour , what they can do to lower their carbon footprint and take that beyond the hour . "
organizers send message to world leaders ridley said he was aiming for one billion participants , hoping the event would send a resounding message to world leaders about significant emissions cuts .
scientists have warned that global warming caused by burning fossil fuels on a massive scale could devastate the planet , hitting the poorest countries hardest with floods , droughts and disease .
sceptics criticized the event as little more than empty symbolism , with danish professor bjorn lomborg claiming the use of candles during the hour could produce more emissions than electric lights .
but united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a video message earlier this month that " earth hour is a way for the citizens of the world to send a clear message .
they want action on climate change . "
lights in the " city that never sleeps " began going dark at 8:30 pm -lrb- 0130 cet -rrb- at some of new york city 's most renowned buildings and landmarks , including broadway theaters , the empire state building , the chrysler building and the signs of several big firms , including coca-cola 's in times square .

fifa and uefa have taken issue with the rule implemented in january that requires elite athletes to indicate their whereabouts on a chosen one-hour period every day , seven days a week .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 eu aims to present united front at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can 27 nations really march in one direction ?
after refining its economic positions at a recent summit , the eu seems ready to present a united front at the upcoming g20 talks in london .
but some issues are still being fought over within the 27-member bloc . at a summit in brussels on march 20 , the eu member states agreed on an extra 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , as well as a further 25 billion euros in emergency credit for eastern europe .
with that , the union appeared to have aligned the position it would take at the upcoming g20 summit in london on april 2 .
going by the words of french president nicolas sarkozy at the latest eu summit , it would seem that the european union is marching to london in step as one unit .
" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .
g8 ministers meet to discuss " human dimension " meanwhile in rome on sunday , labor ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- and six other major economies gathered for talks on the " human dimension " of the financial crisis sweeping the planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment is rising around the world due ´ to the crisis the three-day " group of 14 " meeting will bring together the g8 leading industrial powers with the emerging giants china , india and brazil as well as mexico , south africa and egypt at a time when worldwide job losses are sparking fears of social unrest .
the g14 " social summit " in rome will urge the g20 to put " people first " as they discuss economic recovery strategies and reforms to the financial regulatory system , italian labour minister maurizio sacconi said .
sacconi said the g14 would advocate a " global pact " to ensure sustainable social protections , investment in people , notably skills development , and job creation , especially in the areas of environmental protection , health and education .
imf chief dominique strauss-kahn warned last week that " dramatic " rises in unemployment around the world would set the stage for conflict .
social unrest fears gather credence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests , like this one in paris , have been peaceful so far the world financial crisis could spark " social unrest , some threats to democracy and maybe for some cases , it can also end in war , " he warned during an international labour organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- meeting in geneva .
the ilo in january said the global financial meltdown could claim up to 50 million jobs over 2008 and 2009 , while the world bank warned that the crisis could push 46 million back into poverty .
ilo chief juan somavia will stress in rome " that we are confronting an inter-connected financial , economic and social crisis , and that the attention of policy makers should turn to the three crises at the same time , " his deputy philippe egger said last week .
tens of thousands of people demonstrated in london , rome , berlin and other cities on saturday to express their anger at the human cost of the financial crisis .
organizers of the put people first march for " jobs , justice and climate " in london had rejected as " smears " claims in police briefings that marches could be hijacked by anarchists bent on violence .
france last week saw more than a million workers take to the streets in a nationwide strike to force president sarkozy to boost wages and protect jobs .
a protest in paris left nine police officers injured and led to some 300 arrests . nda / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 371 landmarks powered down worldwide , including the eiffel tower , niagara falls , the las vegas casino strip and beijing 's " bird 's nest " olympic stadium .
the switch-off ended in honolulu , capital of the us state of hawaii .
residents of the chatham islands , a territory of new zealand in the southern pacific ocean , turned off light switches and kicked off the global earth hour .
one of the event 's dramatic episodes occurred in sydney , where the iconic opera house and harbour bridge plunged into darkness on saturday night , killing their lights for an hour .
millions of people turned out in sydney , while melbourne , australia 's second-largest city , came to life with a pedal-powered concert and others enjoyed moonlit picnics and barbecues .
the global grassroots movement began in sydney two years ago , when 2.2 million people switched off their lights .
earth hour has since grown to include 3,929 cities , villages and localities across the globe .
" it is a very positive , hopeful campaign , " andy ridley , the event 's director , told reporters in sydney .
" we want people to think , even if it is for an hour , what they can do to lower their carbon footprint and take that beyond the hour . "
organizers send message to world leaders ridley said he was aiming for one billion participants , hoping the event would send a resounding message to world leaders about significant emissions cuts .
scientists have warned that global warming caused by burning fossil fuels on a massive scale could devastate the planet , hitting the poorest countries hardest with floods , droughts and disease .
sceptics criticized the event as little more than empty symbolism , with danish professor bjorn lomborg claiming the use of candles during the hour could produce more emissions than electric lights .
but united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a video message earlier this month that " earth hour is a way for the citizens of the world to send a clear message .
they want action on climate change . "

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .
" the clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead , " de boer said .
all eyes on the us the united states ' position will be keenly observed in the coming days , since washington recently changed tack on climate change with the inauguration of president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us climate envoy todd stern former us president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , but it was never ratified .
the white house on saturday invited the un and 16 major economies to washington to prepare for international efforts to reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions .
" the us will be powerfully and fervently engaged in this process , " obama 's climate negotiator , todd stern said on sunday .
but he cautioned against unrealistic expectations that the united states could " wave a magic wand " and find solutions to all problems .
" i do n't think anybody should be thinking that the us can ride in on a white horse and make it all work , " he said .
the chinese puzzle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is a major greenhouse gas emitter in particular , washington wants to see china increase its commitment to emissions reduction , since the country 's economic growth made it one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors .
china and the us between them account for more than 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions .
" if you do the math , you simply can not be anywhere near where science tells us we need to be if you do n't have china involved , as well also other major developing countries , " he said .
the kyoto protocol was lenient on developing countries such as china , india and brazil .
this is to change in the document to be signed in copenhagen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 g20 leaders planning revamp of market regulations at london summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 hopes to bring world financial markets into line the world 's biggest economic powers are expected to agree next week on an urgent revamp of market regulations , helping them to smooth over a rift about the need for new public spending to combat the global recession . indeed , the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- landmark summit of the world 's richest and emerging economies in london is likely to sign off on plans to bring world financial controls into line with the changes unleashed by fast-paced globalization by stepping up coordinated market supervision and closing off gaps in the regulatory system .
the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .

the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .

" one of the key principles of efficient doping control is the surprise effect and the possibility to test an athlete without advance notice on a 365 day basis , " the world anti doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- president john fahey said on wednesday , march 25 , in a statement explaining the rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa chief platini -lrb- left -rrb- and fifa president blatter rejected the rule " alleging , as fifa and uefa do , that testing should only take place at training grounds and not during holiday periods , ignores the reality of doping in sport , " fahey said .
" experience has demonstrated that athletes who cheat seize every opportunity to do so and dope when they believe they wo n't be tested . "
fifa and uefa have taken issue with the rule implemented in january that requires elite athletes to indicate their whereabouts on a chosen one-hour period every day , seven days a week .
the soccer bodies have argued that this rule is too invasive , insisting that " the fundamental differences between an individual athlete , who trains on his own ... and a team-sport athlete , who is present at the stadium six days out of seven , and thus easy to locate , " must be taken into account .
they formally rejected the " whereabouts rule , " calling instead for " collective location rules , within the scope of the team . "
unfair policy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa and fifa : leave soccer stars , like david beckham , alone when they 're on vacation uefa chief michel platini and fifa president sepp blatter insist that the new rules are perceived as unfair by many sport associations .
" this is not just the line taken by soccer , but of all the team sports , basketball , handball , volleyball and rugby , " blatter said recently .
but the anti-doping agency said that it did in fact allow teams to submit the location of their players collectively and maintained that only fifa and uefa were disputing the rule .
" wada stakeholders have recognized this reality , and the feedback we have received from the overwhelming majority of other sports , but also from athletes and all those who support doping-free sport , strongly contradicts fifa 's and uefa 's stance , " fahey said .
blatter however put the focus on respecting player 's free time , saying that although the soccer federations are jointly combating doping , it should not turn into a " witch hunt . "
" i do n't want a fight , i just want them to understand , " blatter said .
platini echoed this sentiment of protecting players .
" footballers ca n't be under control 365 days a year , " he said .
" we ask simply that players be left in peace when they are spending their holidays with their families . " ls / tt / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after refining its economic positions at a recent summit , the eu seems ready to present a united front at the upcoming g20 talks in london .
but some issues are still being fought over within the 27-member bloc . at a summit in brussels on march 20 , the eu member states agreed on an extra 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , as well as a further 25 billion euros in emergency credit for eastern europe .
with that , the union appeared to have aligned the position it would take at the upcoming g20 summit in london on april 2 .
going by the words of french president nicolas sarkozy at the latest eu summit , it would seem that the european union is marching to london in step as one unit .
" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 eu aims to present united front at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can 27 nations really march in one direction ?
after refining its economic positions at a recent summit , the eu seems ready to present a united front at the upcoming g20 talks in london .
but some issues are still being fought over within the 27-member bloc . at a summit in brussels on march 20 , the eu member states agreed on an extra 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , as well as a further 25 billion euros in emergency credit for eastern europe .
with that , the union appeared to have aligned the position it would take at the upcoming g20 summit in london on april 2 .
going by the words of french president nicolas sarkozy at the latest eu summit , it would seem that the european union is marching to london in step as one unit .
" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

" experience has demonstrated that athletes who cheat seize every opportunity to do so and dope when they believe they wo n't be tested . "
fifa and uefa have taken issue with the rule implemented in january that requires elite athletes to indicate their whereabouts on a chosen one-hour period every day , seven days a week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 g20 leaders planning revamp of market regulations at london summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 hopes to bring world financial markets into line the world 's biggest economic powers are expected to agree next week on an urgent revamp of market regulations , helping them to smooth over a rift about the need for new public spending to combat the global recession . indeed , the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- landmark summit of the world 's richest and emerging economies in london is likely to sign off on plans to bring world financial controls into line with the changes unleashed by fast-paced globalization by stepping up coordinated market supervision and closing off gaps in the regulatory system .
the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .
g8 ministers meet to discuss " human dimension " meanwhile in rome on sunday , labor ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- and six other major economies gathered for talks on the " human dimension " of the financial crisis sweeping the planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment is rising around the world due ´ to the crisis the three-day " group of 14 " meeting will bring together the g8 leading industrial powers with the emerging giants china , india and brazil as well as mexico , south africa and egypt at a time when worldwide job losses are sparking fears of social unrest .
the g14 " social summit " in rome will urge the g20 to put " people first " as they discuss economic recovery strategies and reforms to the financial regulatory system , italian labour minister maurizio sacconi said .
sacconi said the g14 would advocate a " global pact " to ensure sustainable social protections , investment in people , notably skills development , and job creation , especially in the areas of environmental protection , health and education .
imf chief dominique strauss-kahn warned last week that " dramatic " rises in unemployment around the world would set the stage for conflict .
social unrest fears gather credence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests , like this one in paris , have been peaceful so far the world financial crisis could spark " social unrest , some threats to democracy and maybe for some cases , it can also end in war , " he warned during an international labour organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- meeting in geneva .
the ilo in january said the global financial meltdown could claim up to 50 million jobs over 2008 and 2009 , while the world bank warned that the crisis could push 46 million back into poverty .
ilo chief juan somavia will stress in rome " that we are confronting an inter-connected financial , economic and social crisis , and that the attention of policy makers should turn to the three crises at the same time , " his deputy philippe egger said last week .
tens of thousands of people demonstrated in london , rome , berlin and other cities on saturday to express their anger at the human cost of the financial crisis .
organizers of the put people first march for " jobs , justice and climate " in london had rejected as " smears " claims in police briefings that marches could be hijacked by anarchists bent on violence .

the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .

the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .

" one of the key principles of efficient doping control is the surprise effect and the possibility to test an athlete without advance notice on a 365 day basis , " the world anti doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- president john fahey said on wednesday , march 25 , in a statement explaining the rule .

" experience has demonstrated that athletes who cheat seize every opportunity to do so and dope when they believe they wo n't be tested . "
fifa and uefa have taken issue with the rule implemented in january that requires elite athletes to indicate their whereabouts on a chosen one-hour period every day , seven days a week .
the soccer bodies have argued that this rule is too invasive , insisting that " the fundamental differences between an individual athlete , who trains on his own ... and a team-sport athlete , who is present at the stadium six days out of seven , and thus easy to locate , " must be taken into account .

" one of the key principles of efficient doping control is the surprise effect and the possibility to test an athlete without advance notice on a 365 day basis , " the world anti doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- president john fahey said on wednesday , march 25 , in a statement explaining the rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa chief platini -lrb- left -rrb- and fifa president blatter rejected the rule " alleging , as fifa and uefa do , that testing should only take place at training grounds and not during holiday periods , ignores the reality of doping in sport , " fahey said .
" experience has demonstrated that athletes who cheat seize every opportunity to do so and dope when they believe they wo n't be tested . "
fifa and uefa have taken issue with the rule implemented in january that requires elite athletes to indicate their whereabouts on a chosen one-hour period every day , seven days a week .
the soccer bodies have argued that this rule is too invasive , insisting that " the fundamental differences between an individual athlete , who trains on his own ... and a team-sport athlete , who is present at the stadium six days out of seven , and thus easy to locate , " must be taken into account .
they formally rejected the " whereabouts rule , " calling instead for " collective location rules , within the scope of the team . "
unfair policy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa and fifa : leave soccer stars , like david beckham , alone when they 're on vacation uefa chief michel platini and fifa president sepp blatter insist that the new rules are perceived as unfair by many sport associations .
" this is not just the line taken by soccer , but of all the team sports , basketball , handball , volleyball and rugby , " blatter said recently .
but the anti-doping agency said that it did in fact allow teams to submit the location of their players collectively and maintained that only fifa and uefa were disputing the rule .
" wada stakeholders have recognized this reality , and the feedback we have received from the overwhelming majority of other sports , but also from athletes and all those who support doping-free sport , strongly contradicts fifa 's and uefa 's stance , " fahey said .
blatter however put the focus on respecting player 's free time , saying that although the soccer federations are jointly combating doping , it should not turn into a " witch hunt . "
" i do n't want a fight , i just want them to understand , " blatter said .
platini echoed this sentiment of protecting players .
" footballers ca n't be under control 365 days a year , " he said .
" we ask simply that players be left in peace when they are spending their holidays with their families . " ls / tt / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 g20 leaders planning revamp of market regulations at london summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 hopes to bring world financial markets into line the world 's biggest economic powers are expected to agree next week on an urgent revamp of market regulations , helping them to smooth over a rift about the need for new public spending to combat the global recession . indeed , the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- landmark summit of the world 's richest and emerging economies in london is likely to sign off on plans to bring world financial controls into line with the changes unleashed by fast-paced globalization by stepping up coordinated market supervision and closing off gaps in the regulatory system .
the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .

marcell jansen , bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski got the other goals .
germany top group 4 with 13 points from five games ahead of russia , who have nine from four games .
only the group winner qualifies directly for the 2010 finals in south africa .
" we have fulfilled our duty , " said germany coach joachim loew .
" we had expected liechtenstein would defend with nine or ten men .
obviously , we would have liked to have scored a few more goals , but i am quite content . "
liechtenstein coach hans-peter zaugg admitted afterwards this was a good result for them and germany 's stars had expected more goals .
liechtenstein goalkeeper peter jehle said : " i am a little disappointed how we conceded the goals early in each half .
we made life too easy for the germans but in the end we played a decent match . "
loew had to make several changes due to injuries concerning among others striker miroslav klose , midfielder torsten frings and defender arne friedrich .
tsg hoffenheim defender andreas beck started for a first time and hanover 's robert enke returned between the posts from a hand fracture .
germany were determined from the start to make up for home defeats against england and norway in their last two -lrb- friendly -rrb- matches , with mario gomez heading wide just 16 seconds into the game .
chelsea midfielder ballack broke the deadlock in the fourth minute with a stunning volley high into the net off schweinsteiger 's cross .
just five minutes later sv hamburg 's jansen doubled the lead on the rebound from podolski 's shot saved which had been saved by jehle .
avalanche of goals fails to materialize the fans naturally hoped for plenty goals but the germans then showed a lack of precision until the break , and the second half passed in identical fashion .

enke had to make only one save , in the 54th against mario frick , while up front most notably vfb stuttgart forward mario gomez failed to score as his germany drought now covers almost one year .
germany next visit wales , 2-0 losers against finland saturday , on wednesday .
the same day liechtenstein host russia .
" i am pleased with the victory , but now much harder tasks lie ahead for us , " said ballack whose side face russia next october in moscow in the game which is likely to decide the group .

marcell jansen , bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski got the other goals .
germany top group 4 with 13 points from five games ahead of russia , who have nine from four games .

" we had expected liechtenstein would defend with nine or ten men .
obviously , we would have liked to have scored a few more goals , but i am quite content . "
liechtenstein coach hans-peter zaugg admitted afterwards this was a good result for them and germany 's stars had expected more goals .
liechtenstein goalkeeper peter jehle said : " i am a little disappointed how we conceded the goals early in each half .
we made life too easy for the germans but in the end we played a decent match . "
loew had to make several changes due to injuries concerning among others striker miroslav klose , midfielder torsten frings and defender arne friedrich .

germany were determined from the start to make up for home defeats against england and norway in their last two -lrb- friendly -rrb- matches , with mario gomez heading wide just 16 seconds into the game .

marcell jansen , bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski got the other goals .
germany top group 4 with 13 points from five games ahead of russia , who have nine from four games .
only the group winner qualifies directly for the 2010 finals in south africa .
" we have fulfilled our duty , " said germany coach joachim loew .
" we had expected liechtenstein would defend with nine or ten men .
obviously , we would have liked to have scored a few more goals , but i am quite content . "
liechtenstein coach hans-peter zaugg admitted afterwards this was a good result for them and germany 's stars had expected more goals .
liechtenstein goalkeeper peter jehle said : " i am a little disappointed how we conceded the goals early in each half .
we made life too easy for the germans but in the end we played a decent match . "
loew had to make several changes due to injuries concerning among others striker miroslav klose , midfielder torsten frings and defender arne friedrich .
tsg hoffenheim defender andreas beck started for a first time and hanover 's robert enke returned between the posts from a hand fracture .
germany were determined from the start to make up for home defeats against england and norway in their last two -lrb- friendly -rrb- matches , with mario gomez heading wide just 16 seconds into the game .
chelsea midfielder ballack broke the deadlock in the fourth minute with a stunning volley high into the net off schweinsteiger 's cross .
just five minutes later sv hamburg 's jansen doubled the lead on the rebound from podolski 's shot saved which had been saved by jehle .
avalanche of goals fails to materialize the fans naturally hoped for plenty goals but the germans then showed a lack of precision until the break , and the second half passed in identical fashion .

enke had to make only one save , in the 54th against mario frick , while up front most notably vfb stuttgart forward mario gomez failed to score as his germany drought now covers almost one year .

" one of the key principles of efficient doping control is the surprise effect and the possibility to test an athlete without advance notice on a 365 day basis , " the world anti doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- president john fahey said on wednesday , march 25 , in a statement explaining the rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa chief platini -lrb- left -rrb- and fifa president blatter rejected the rule " alleging , as fifa and uefa do , that testing should only take place at training grounds and not during holiday periods , ignores the reality of doping in sport , " fahey said .
" experience has demonstrated that athletes who cheat seize every opportunity to do so and dope when they believe they wo n't be tested . "
fifa and uefa have taken issue with the rule implemented in january that requires elite athletes to indicate their whereabouts on a chosen one-hour period every day , seven days a week .
the soccer bodies have argued that this rule is too invasive , insisting that " the fundamental differences between an individual athlete , who trains on his own ... and a team-sport athlete , who is present at the stadium six days out of seven , and thus easy to locate , " must be taken into account .
they formally rejected the " whereabouts rule , " calling instead for " collective location rules , within the scope of the team . "
unfair policy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa and fifa : leave soccer stars , like david beckham , alone when they 're on vacation uefa chief michel platini and fifa president sepp blatter insist that the new rules are perceived as unfair by many sport associations .
" this is not just the line taken by soccer , but of all the team sports , basketball , handball , volleyball and rugby , " blatter said recently .
but the anti-doping agency said that it did in fact allow teams to submit the location of their players collectively and maintained that only fifa and uefa were disputing the rule .
" wada stakeholders have recognized this reality , and the feedback we have received from the overwhelming majority of other sports , but also from athletes and all those who support doping-free sport , strongly contradicts fifa 's and uefa 's stance , " fahey said .
blatter however put the focus on respecting player 's free time , saying that although the soccer federations are jointly combating doping , it should not turn into a " witch hunt . "
" i do n't want a fight , i just want them to understand , " blatter said .
platini echoed this sentiment of protecting players .
" footballers ca n't be under control 365 days a year , " he said .
" we ask simply that players be left in peace when they are spending their holidays with their families . " ls / tt / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the long term however , the german government bank bailout agency soffin is to take complete control of the bank , hre said .
soffin is to purchase 20 million shares at a price of three euros each , granting a 60-million-euro -lrb- $ 80.1-million -rrb- capital injection to hre .
the current shareholders will initially remain on board .
" -lrb- soffin -rrb- intends to take action to stabilize hypo real estate group , in the interest of stabilizing the financial markets , " soffin said .
" soffin will implement measures to achieve a sufficient recapitalization " of hre , the statement added .
however , the prerequisite for soffin to stabilize the ailing bank is said to be a complete state takeover , either through the bailout fund or by direct government intervention .
" to this end it is intended to make use of the options that will be provided by the german financial markets stabilization amendment act , which is currently being discussed in the legislative process , " a statement on the bank 's website said .

the pre-tax loss was 5.375 billion , it said , compared to pre-tax profits of 862 million euros in 2007 .
it said hre expected to make losses until at least 2011 .
" the financial year 2008 reflects the impact of the general crisis on the international financial markets and the specific extremely difficult situation for the hypo real estate group , " wieandt , said in a statement .
hre said in its earnings statement that complex " derivative " investments with lehman brothers had been the main cause of a 150-million-euro expense on its own balance sheet .
it said it was also hit by losses linked to icelandic banks , which were largely wiped out by the financial crisis last year .

in the long term however , the german government bank bailout agency soffin is to take complete control of the bank , hre said .
soffin is to purchase 20 million shares at a price of three euros each , granting a 60-million-euro -lrb- $ 80.1-million -rrb- capital injection to hre .
the current shareholders will initially remain on board .
" -lrb- soffin -rrb- intends to take action to stabilize hypo real estate group , in the interest of stabilizing the financial markets , " soffin said .
" soffin will implement measures to achieve a sufficient recapitalization " of hre , the statement added .
however , the prerequisite for soffin to stabilize the ailing bank is said to be a complete state takeover , either through the bailout fund or by direct government intervention .
" to this end it is intended to make use of the options that will be provided by the german financial markets stabilization amendment act , which is currently being discussed in the legislative process , " a statement on the bank 's website said .
the act , which specifies the conditions for a state expropriation of hre , has been approved by germany 's lower house of parliament .
state ministers are expected to grant their approval in an upper house consultation due friday .
berlin moves to avert catastrophic bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doomed lehman brothers could have brought down hre berlin is concerned that the failure of hre could have catastrophic consequences similar to those sparked by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september , which hit financial markets around the world .
the head of hre said sunday the state 's purchase of the 8.7 percent stake in the bank would allow it to survive despite expected losses for the next two years .
chief executive axel wieandt hailed the government 's purchase of 20 million shares as " good news . "
" with the proposed long-term liquidity and capital support , the federal republic ... has put in place the necessary requirements for hre to continue , " wieandt said in a statement .
" we welcome this step .
it is in the interests of the company and clearly good news , " he added .
the purchase of hre shares - at the minimum legal price of three euros per share - is an " important signal , an important first step , " he said .
" the stabilization and rescue of hre must succeed .
it is in everyone 's interests , " the chief executive stressed .
however , he acknowledged that the bank expected to be " in a loss situation for at least the next two years . "
" nevertheless , we see our medium-term strategic prospects as positive , " he said .
hre announces hefty losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre 's wieandt was understandably pleased hre also released its unaudited earnings statement for 2008 , reporting a hefty net loss of 5.46 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.25 billion -rrb- due largely to write-downs on intangible assets .
" this result very much reflects the difficult situation on the capital and financing markets , " the bank said in the earnings statement .
the pre-tax loss was 5.375 billion , it said , compared to pre-tax profits of 862 million euros in 2007 .
it said hre expected to make losses until at least 2011 .
" the financial year 2008 reflects the impact of the general crisis on the international financial markets and the specific extremely difficult situation for the hypo real estate group , " wieandt , said in a statement .
hre said in its earnings statement that complex " derivative " investments with lehman brothers had been the main cause of a 150-million-euro expense on its own balance sheet .
it said it was also hit by losses linked to icelandic banks , which were largely wiped out by the financial crisis last year .

the switch-off ended in honolulu , capital of the us state of hawaii .
residents of the chatham islands , a territory of new zealand in the southern pacific ocean , turned off light switches and kicked off the global earth hour .

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .

additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .

that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .
" the clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead , " de boer said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us climate envoy todd stern former us president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , but it was never ratified .
the white house on saturday invited the un and 16 major economies to washington to prepare for international efforts to reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 eu aims to present united front at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can 27 nations really march in one direction ?
after refining its economic positions at a recent summit , the eu seems ready to present a united front at the upcoming g20 talks in london .
but some issues are still being fought over within the 27-member bloc . at a summit in brussels on march 20 , the eu member states agreed on an extra 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , as well as a further 25 billion euros in emergency credit for eastern europe .
with that , the union appeared to have aligned the position it would take at the upcoming g20 summit in london on april 2 .
going by the words of french president nicolas sarkozy at the latest eu summit , it would seem that the european union is marching to london in step as one unit .
" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 eu aims to present united front at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can 27 nations really march in one direction ?
after refining its economic positions at a recent summit , the eu seems ready to present a united front at the upcoming g20 talks in london .
but some issues are still being fought over within the 27-member bloc . at a summit in brussels on march 20 , the eu member states agreed on an extra 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , as well as a further 25 billion euros in emergency credit for eastern europe .
with that , the union appeared to have aligned the position it would take at the upcoming g20 summit in london on april 2 .
going by the words of french president nicolas sarkozy at the latest eu summit , it would seem that the european union is marching to london in step as one unit .
" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

marcell jansen , bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski got the other goals .
germany top group 4 with 13 points from five games ahead of russia , who have nine from four games .
only the group winner qualifies directly for the 2010 finals in south africa .
" we have fulfilled our duty , " said germany coach joachim loew .
" we had expected liechtenstein would defend with nine or ten men .
obviously , we would have liked to have scored a few more goals , but i am quite content . "
liechtenstein coach hans-peter zaugg admitted afterwards this was a good result for them and germany 's stars had expected more goals .
liechtenstein goalkeeper peter jehle said : " i am a little disappointed how we conceded the goals early in each half .
we made life too easy for the germans but in the end we played a decent match . "
loew had to make several changes due to injuries concerning among others striker miroslav klose , midfielder torsten frings and defender arne friedrich .
tsg hoffenheim defender andreas beck started for a first time and hanover 's robert enke returned between the posts from a hand fracture .
germany were determined from the start to make up for home defeats against england and norway in their last two -lrb- friendly -rrb- matches , with mario gomez heading wide just 16 seconds into the game .
chelsea midfielder ballack broke the deadlock in the fourth minute with a stunning volley high into the net off schweinsteiger 's cross .
just five minutes later sv hamburg 's jansen doubled the lead on the rebound from podolski 's shot saved which had been saved by jehle .
avalanche of goals fails to materialize the fans naturally hoped for plenty goals but the germans then showed a lack of precision until the break , and the second half passed in identical fashion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweini added a goal to give germany a 3-0 lead schweinsteiger made victory secure when he scored the third goal in the 48th when he hit the empty net after an initial shot from his bayern munich team-mate podolski , who then found the net himself two minutes later .
enke had to make only one save , in the 54th against mario frick , while up front most notably vfb stuttgart forward mario gomez failed to score as his germany drought now covers almost one year .
germany next visit wales , 2-0 losers against finland saturday , on wednesday .
the same day liechtenstein host russia .
" i am pleased with the victory , but now much harder tasks lie ahead for us , " said ballack whose side face russia next october in moscow in the game which is likely to decide the group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 g20 leaders planning revamp of market regulations at london summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 hopes to bring world financial markets into line the world 's biggest economic powers are expected to agree next week on an urgent revamp of market regulations , helping them to smooth over a rift about the need for new public spending to combat the global recession . indeed , the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- landmark summit of the world 's richest and emerging economies in london is likely to sign off on plans to bring world financial controls into line with the changes unleashed by fast-paced globalization by stepping up coordinated market supervision and closing off gaps in the regulatory system .
the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .
g8 ministers meet to discuss " human dimension " meanwhile in rome on sunday , labor ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- and six other major economies gathered for talks on the " human dimension " of the financial crisis sweeping the planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment is rising around the world due ´ to the crisis the three-day " group of 14 " meeting will bring together the g8 leading industrial powers with the emerging giants china , india and brazil as well as mexico , south africa and egypt at a time when worldwide job losses are sparking fears of social unrest .
the g14 " social summit " in rome will urge the g20 to put " people first " as they discuss economic recovery strategies and reforms to the financial regulatory system , italian labour minister maurizio sacconi said .
sacconi said the g14 would advocate a " global pact " to ensure sustainable social protections , investment in people , notably skills development , and job creation , especially in the areas of environmental protection , health and education .
imf chief dominique strauss-kahn warned last week that " dramatic " rises in unemployment around the world would set the stage for conflict .
social unrest fears gather credence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests , like this one in paris , have been peaceful so far the world financial crisis could spark " social unrest , some threats to democracy and maybe for some cases , it can also end in war , " he warned during an international labour organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- meeting in geneva .
the ilo in january said the global financial meltdown could claim up to 50 million jobs over 2008 and 2009 , while the world bank warned that the crisis could push 46 million back into poverty .
ilo chief juan somavia will stress in rome " that we are confronting an inter-connected financial , economic and social crisis , and that the attention of policy makers should turn to the three crises at the same time , " his deputy philippe egger said last week .
tens of thousands of people demonstrated in london , rome , berlin and other cities on saturday to express their anger at the human cost of the financial crisis .
organizers of the put people first march for " jobs , justice and climate " in london had rejected as " smears " claims in police briefings that marches could be hijacked by anarchists bent on violence .
france last week saw more than a million workers take to the streets in a nationwide strike to force president sarkozy to boost wages and protect jobs .

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .
" the clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead , " de boer said .
all eyes on the us the united states ' position will be keenly observed in the coming days , since washington recently changed tack on climate change with the inauguration of president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us climate envoy todd stern former us president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , but it was never ratified .
the white house on saturday invited the un and 16 major economies to washington to prepare for international efforts to reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions .
" the us will be powerfully and fervently engaged in this process , " obama 's climate negotiator , todd stern said on sunday .
but he cautioned against unrealistic expectations that the united states could " wave a magic wand " and find solutions to all problems .
" i do n't think anybody should be thinking that the us can ride in on a white horse and make it all work , " he said .
the chinese puzzle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is a major greenhouse gas emitter in particular , washington wants to see china increase its commitment to emissions reduction , since the country 's economic growth made it one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors .
china and the us between them account for more than 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions .
" if you do the math , you simply can not be anywhere near where science tells us we need to be if you do n't have china involved , as well also other major developing countries , " he said .
the kyoto protocol was lenient on developing countries such as china , india and brazil .
this is to change in the document to be signed in copenhagen .

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .
" the clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead , " de boer said .
all eyes on the us the united states ' position will be keenly observed in the coming days , since washington recently changed tack on climate change with the inauguration of president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us climate envoy todd stern former us president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , but it was never ratified .
the white house on saturday invited the un and 16 major economies to washington to prepare for international efforts to reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions .
" the us will be powerfully and fervently engaged in this process , " obama 's climate negotiator , todd stern said on sunday .
but he cautioned against unrealistic expectations that the united states could " wave a magic wand " and find solutions to all problems .
" i do n't think anybody should be thinking that the us can ride in on a white horse and make it all work , " he said .
the chinese puzzle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is a major greenhouse gas emitter in particular , washington wants to see china increase its commitment to emissions reduction , since the country 's economic growth made it one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors .
china and the us between them account for more than 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions .
" if you do the math , you simply can not be anywhere near where science tells us we need to be if you do n't have china involved , as well also other major developing countries , " he said .
the kyoto protocol was lenient on developing countries such as china , india and brazil .
this is to change in the document to be signed in copenhagen .
de boer welcomed obama 's initiative , saying it could be " useful " to find a political solution to the climate change talks . tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 371 landmarks powered down worldwide , including the eiffel tower , niagara falls , the las vegas casino strip and beijing 's " bird 's nest " olympic stadium .
the switch-off ended in honolulu , capital of the us state of hawaii .
residents of the chatham islands , a territory of new zealand in the southern pacific ocean , turned off light switches and kicked off the global earth hour .
one of the event 's dramatic episodes occurred in sydney , where the iconic opera house and harbour bridge plunged into darkness on saturday night , killing their lights for an hour .
millions of people turned out in sydney , while melbourne , australia 's second-largest city , came to life with a pedal-powered concert and others enjoyed moonlit picnics and barbecues .
the global grassroots movement began in sydney two years ago , when 2.2 million people switched off their lights .
earth hour has since grown to include 3,929 cities , villages and localities across the globe .
" it is a very positive , hopeful campaign , " andy ridley , the event 's director , told reporters in sydney .
" we want people to think , even if it is for an hour , what they can do to lower their carbon footprint and take that beyond the hour . "
organizers send message to world leaders ridley said he was aiming for one billion participants , hoping the event would send a resounding message to world leaders about significant emissions cuts .
scientists have warned that global warming caused by burning fossil fuels on a massive scale could devastate the planet , hitting the poorest countries hardest with floods , droughts and disease .
sceptics criticized the event as little more than empty symbolism , with danish professor bjorn lomborg claiming the use of candles during the hour could produce more emissions than electric lights .

the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .

the ilo in january said the global financial meltdown could claim up to 50 million jobs over 2008 and 2009 , while the world bank warned that the crisis could push 46 million back into poverty .

the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .

the ilo in january said the global financial meltdown could claim up to 50 million jobs over 2008 and 2009 , while the world bank warned that the crisis could push 46 million back into poverty .

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .

marcell jansen , bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski got the other goals .
germany top group 4 with 13 points from five games ahead of russia , who have nine from four games .
only the group winner qualifies directly for the 2010 finals in south africa .
" we have fulfilled our duty , " said germany coach joachim loew .
" we had expected liechtenstein would defend with nine or ten men .
obviously , we would have liked to have scored a few more goals , but i am quite content . "
liechtenstein coach hans-peter zaugg admitted afterwards this was a good result for them and germany 's stars had expected more goals .
liechtenstein goalkeeper peter jehle said : " i am a little disappointed how we conceded the goals early in each half .
we made life too easy for the germans but in the end we played a decent match . "
loew had to make several changes due to injuries concerning among others striker miroslav klose , midfielder torsten frings and defender arne friedrich .
tsg hoffenheim defender andreas beck started for a first time and hanover 's robert enke returned between the posts from a hand fracture .
germany were determined from the start to make up for home defeats against england and norway in their last two -lrb- friendly -rrb- matches , with mario gomez heading wide just 16 seconds into the game .
chelsea midfielder ballack broke the deadlock in the fourth minute with a stunning volley high into the net off schweinsteiger 's cross .
just five minutes later sv hamburg 's jansen doubled the lead on the rebound from podolski 's shot saved which had been saved by jehle .
avalanche of goals fails to materialize the fans naturally hoped for plenty goals but the germans then showed a lack of precision until the break , and the second half passed in identical fashion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweini added a goal to give germany a 3-0 lead schweinsteiger made victory secure when he scored the third goal in the 48th when he hit the empty net after an initial shot from his bayern munich team-mate podolski , who then found the net himself two minutes later .
enke had to make only one save , in the 54th against mario frick , while up front most notably vfb stuttgart forward mario gomez failed to score as his germany drought now covers almost one year .

in the long term however , the german government bank bailout agency soffin is to take complete control of the bank , hre said .
soffin is to purchase 20 million shares at a price of three euros each , granting a 60-million-euro -lrb- $ 80.1-million -rrb- capital injection to hre .
the current shareholders will initially remain on board .
" -lrb- soffin -rrb- intends to take action to stabilize hypo real estate group , in the interest of stabilizing the financial markets , " soffin said .
" soffin will implement measures to achieve a sufficient recapitalization " of hre , the statement added .
however , the prerequisite for soffin to stabilize the ailing bank is said to be a complete state takeover , either through the bailout fund or by direct government intervention .
" to this end it is intended to make use of the options that will be provided by the german financial markets stabilization amendment act , which is currently being discussed in the legislative process , " a statement on the bank 's website said .
the act , which specifies the conditions for a state expropriation of hre , has been approved by germany 's lower house of parliament .
state ministers are expected to grant their approval in an upper house consultation due friday .
berlin moves to avert catastrophic bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doomed lehman brothers could have brought down hre berlin is concerned that the failure of hre could have catastrophic consequences similar to those sparked by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september , which hit financial markets around the world .
the head of hre said sunday the state 's purchase of the 8.7 percent stake in the bank would allow it to survive despite expected losses for the next two years .
chief executive axel wieandt hailed the government 's purchase of 20 million shares as " good news . "
" with the proposed long-term liquidity and capital support , the federal republic ... has put in place the necessary requirements for hre to continue , " wieandt said in a statement .
" we welcome this step .
it is in the interests of the company and clearly good news , " he added .
the purchase of hre shares - at the minimum legal price of three euros per share - is an " important signal , an important first step , " he said .
" the stabilization and rescue of hre must succeed .
it is in everyone 's interests , " the chief executive stressed .
however , he acknowledged that the bank expected to be " in a loss situation for at least the next two years . "
" nevertheless , we see our medium-term strategic prospects as positive , " he said .
hre announces hefty losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre 's wieandt was understandably pleased hre also released its unaudited earnings statement for 2008 , reporting a hefty net loss of 5.46 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.25 billion -rrb- due largely to write-downs on intangible assets .
" this result very much reflects the difficult situation on the capital and financing markets , " the bank said in the earnings statement .
the pre-tax loss was 5.375 billion , it said , compared to pre-tax profits of 862 million euros in 2007 .
it said hre expected to make losses until at least 2011 .
" the financial year 2008 reflects the impact of the general crisis on the international financial markets and the specific extremely difficult situation for the hypo real estate group , " wieandt , said in a statement .
hre said in its earnings statement that complex " derivative " investments with lehman brothers had been the main cause of a 150-million-euro expense on its own balance sheet .
it said it was also hit by losses linked to icelandic banks , which were largely wiped out by the financial crisis last year .
hre has already benefited from more than 100 billion euros in private and public aid to keep it afloat . nda / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 29.03.2009 anti-doping agency takes fifa , uefa to task over testing rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa and uefa argue that a new anti-doping rule is too invasive the chief of the world anti-doping agency has accused fifa and uefa of ignoring the reality of doping after the soccer associations rejected tighter drug testing rules . " one of the key principles of efficient doping control is the surprise effect and the possibility to test an athlete without advance notice on a 365 day basis , " the world anti doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- president john fahey said on wednesday , march 25 , in a statement explaining the rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa chief platini -lrb- left -rrb- and fifa president blatter rejected the rule " alleging , as fifa and uefa do , that testing should only take place at training grounds and not during holiday periods , ignores the reality of doping in sport , " fahey said .
" experience has demonstrated that athletes who cheat seize every opportunity to do so and dope when they believe they wo n't be tested . "
fifa and uefa have taken issue with the rule implemented in january that requires elite athletes to indicate their whereabouts on a chosen one-hour period every day , seven days a week .
the soccer bodies have argued that this rule is too invasive , insisting that " the fundamental differences between an individual athlete , who trains on his own ... and a team-sport athlete , who is present at the stadium six days out of seven , and thus easy to locate , " must be taken into account .
they formally rejected the " whereabouts rule , " calling instead for " collective location rules , within the scope of the team . "
unfair policy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa and fifa : leave soccer stars , like david beckham , alone when they 're on vacation uefa chief michel platini and fifa president sepp blatter insist that the new rules are perceived as unfair by many sport associations .
" this is not just the line taken by soccer , but of all the team sports , basketball , handball , volleyball and rugby , " blatter said recently .
but the anti-doping agency said that it did in fact allow teams to submit the location of their players collectively and maintained that only fifa and uefa were disputing the rule .
" wada stakeholders have recognized this reality , and the feedback we have received from the overwhelming majority of other sports , but also from athletes and all those who support doping-free sport , strongly contradicts fifa 's and uefa 's stance , " fahey said .
blatter however put the focus on respecting player 's free time , saying that although the soccer federations are jointly combating doping , it should not turn into a " witch hunt . "
" i do n't want a fight , i just want them to understand , " blatter said .
platini echoed this sentiment of protecting players .
" footballers ca n't be under control 365 days a year , " he said .
" we ask simply that players be left in peace when they are spending their holidays with their families . " ls / tt / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

marcell jansen , bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski got the other goals .
germany top group 4 with 13 points from five games ahead of russia , who have nine from four games .
only the group winner qualifies directly for the 2010 finals in south africa .
" we have fulfilled our duty , " said germany coach joachim loew .
" we had expected liechtenstein would defend with nine or ten men .
obviously , we would have liked to have scored a few more goals , but i am quite content . "
liechtenstein coach hans-peter zaugg admitted afterwards this was a good result for them and germany 's stars had expected more goals .
liechtenstein goalkeeper peter jehle said : " i am a little disappointed how we conceded the goals early in each half .
we made life too easy for the germans but in the end we played a decent match . "
loew had to make several changes due to injuries concerning among others striker miroslav klose , midfielder torsten frings and defender arne friedrich .
tsg hoffenheim defender andreas beck started for a first time and hanover 's robert enke returned between the posts from a hand fracture .
germany were determined from the start to make up for home defeats against england and norway in their last two -lrb- friendly -rrb- matches , with mario gomez heading wide just 16 seconds into the game .
chelsea midfielder ballack broke the deadlock in the fourth minute with a stunning volley high into the net off schweinsteiger 's cross .
just five minutes later sv hamburg 's jansen doubled the lead on the rebound from podolski 's shot saved which had been saved by jehle .
avalanche of goals fails to materialize the fans naturally hoped for plenty goals but the germans then showed a lack of precision until the break , and the second half passed in identical fashion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweini added a goal to give germany a 3-0 lead schweinsteiger made victory secure when he scored the third goal in the 48th when he hit the empty net after an initial shot from his bayern munich team-mate podolski , who then found the net himself two minutes later .
enke had to make only one save , in the 54th against mario frick , while up front most notably vfb stuttgart forward mario gomez failed to score as his germany drought now covers almost one year .
germany next visit wales , 2-0 losers against finland saturday , on wednesday .
the same day liechtenstein host russia .
" i am pleased with the victory , but now much harder tasks lie ahead for us , " said ballack whose side face russia next october in moscow in the game which is likely to decide the group .

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .
" the clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead , " de boer said .
all eyes on the us the united states ' position will be keenly observed in the coming days , since washington recently changed tack on climate change with the inauguration of president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us climate envoy todd stern former us president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , but it was never ratified .
the white house on saturday invited the un and 16 major economies to washington to prepare for international efforts to reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions .
" the us will be powerfully and fervently engaged in this process , " obama 's climate negotiator , todd stern said on sunday .
but he cautioned against unrealistic expectations that the united states could " wave a magic wand " and find solutions to all problems .
" i do n't think anybody should be thinking that the us can ride in on a white horse and make it all work , " he said .
the chinese puzzle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is a major greenhouse gas emitter in particular , washington wants to see china increase its commitment to emissions reduction , since the country 's economic growth made it one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors .
china and the us between them account for more than 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions .
" if you do the math , you simply can not be anywhere near where science tells us we need to be if you do n't have china involved , as well also other major developing countries , " he said .
the kyoto protocol was lenient on developing countries such as china , india and brazil .
this is to change in the document to be signed in copenhagen .
de boer welcomed obama 's initiative , saying it could be " useful " to find a political solution to the climate change talks . tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

marcell jansen , bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski got the other goals .
germany top group 4 with 13 points from five games ahead of russia , who have nine from four games .
only the group winner qualifies directly for the 2010 finals in south africa .
" we have fulfilled our duty , " said germany coach joachim loew .
" we had expected liechtenstein would defend with nine or ten men .
obviously , we would have liked to have scored a few more goals , but i am quite content . "
liechtenstein coach hans-peter zaugg admitted afterwards this was a good result for them and germany 's stars had expected more goals .
liechtenstein goalkeeper peter jehle said : " i am a little disappointed how we conceded the goals early in each half .
we made life too easy for the germans but in the end we played a decent match . "
loew had to make several changes due to injuries concerning among others striker miroslav klose , midfielder torsten frings and defender arne friedrich .
tsg hoffenheim defender andreas beck started for a first time and hanover 's robert enke returned between the posts from a hand fracture .
germany were determined from the start to make up for home defeats against england and norway in their last two -lrb- friendly -rrb- matches , with mario gomez heading wide just 16 seconds into the game .
chelsea midfielder ballack broke the deadlock in the fourth minute with a stunning volley high into the net off schweinsteiger 's cross .
just five minutes later sv hamburg 's jansen doubled the lead on the rebound from podolski 's shot saved which had been saved by jehle .
avalanche of goals fails to materialize the fans naturally hoped for plenty goals but the germans then showed a lack of precision until the break , and the second half passed in identical fashion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweini added a goal to give germany a 3-0 lead schweinsteiger made victory secure when he scored the third goal in the 48th when he hit the empty net after an initial shot from his bayern munich team-mate podolski , who then found the net himself two minutes later .
enke had to make only one save , in the 54th against mario frick , while up front most notably vfb stuttgart forward mario gomez failed to score as his germany drought now covers almost one year .
germany next visit wales , 2-0 losers against finland saturday , on wednesday .
the same day liechtenstein host russia .
" i am pleased with the victory , but now much harder tasks lie ahead for us , " said ballack whose side face russia next october in moscow in the game which is likely to decide the group .

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .
" the clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead , " de boer said .
all eyes on the us the united states ' position will be keenly observed in the coming days , since washington recently changed tack on climate change with the inauguration of president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us climate envoy todd stern former us president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , but it was never ratified .
the white house on saturday invited the un and 16 major economies to washington to prepare for international efforts to reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions .
" the us will be powerfully and fervently engaged in this process , " obama 's climate negotiator , todd stern said on sunday .
but he cautioned against unrealistic expectations that the united states could " wave a magic wand " and find solutions to all problems .
" i do n't think anybody should be thinking that the us can ride in on a white horse and make it all work , " he said .
the chinese puzzle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is a major greenhouse gas emitter in particular , washington wants to see china increase its commitment to emissions reduction , since the country 's economic growth made it one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors .
china and the us between them account for more than 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions .
" if you do the math , you simply can not be anywhere near where science tells us we need to be if you do n't have china involved , as well also other major developing countries , " he said .
the kyoto protocol was lenient on developing countries such as china , india and brazil .
this is to change in the document to be signed in copenhagen .
de boer welcomed obama 's initiative , saying it could be " useful " to find a political solution to the climate change talks . tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one of the key principles of efficient doping control is the surprise effect and the possibility to test an athlete without advance notice on a 365 day basis , " the world anti doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- president john fahey said on wednesday , march 25 , in a statement explaining the rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa chief platini -lrb- left -rrb- and fifa president blatter rejected the rule " alleging , as fifa and uefa do , that testing should only take place at training grounds and not during holiday periods , ignores the reality of doping in sport , " fahey said .
" experience has demonstrated that athletes who cheat seize every opportunity to do so and dope when they believe they wo n't be tested . "
fifa and uefa have taken issue with the rule implemented in january that requires elite athletes to indicate their whereabouts on a chosen one-hour period every day , seven days a week .
the soccer bodies have argued that this rule is too invasive , insisting that " the fundamental differences between an individual athlete , who trains on his own ... and a team-sport athlete , who is present at the stadium six days out of seven , and thus easy to locate , " must be taken into account .
they formally rejected the " whereabouts rule , " calling instead for " collective location rules , within the scope of the team . "
unfair policy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa and fifa : leave soccer stars , like david beckham , alone when they 're on vacation uefa chief michel platini and fifa president sepp blatter insist that the new rules are perceived as unfair by many sport associations .
" this is not just the line taken by soccer , but of all the team sports , basketball , handball , volleyball and rugby , " blatter said recently .
but the anti-doping agency said that it did in fact allow teams to submit the location of their players collectively and maintained that only fifa and uefa were disputing the rule .
" wada stakeholders have recognized this reality , and the feedback we have received from the overwhelming majority of other sports , but also from athletes and all those who support doping-free sport , strongly contradicts fifa 's and uefa 's stance , " fahey said .
blatter however put the focus on respecting player 's free time , saying that although the soccer federations are jointly combating doping , it should not turn into a " witch hunt . "
" i do n't want a fight , i just want them to understand , " blatter said .
platini echoed this sentiment of protecting players .
" footballers ca n't be under control 365 days a year , " he said .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 eu aims to present united front at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can 27 nations really march in one direction ?
after refining its economic positions at a recent summit , the eu seems ready to present a united front at the upcoming g20 talks in london .
but some issues are still being fought over within the 27-member bloc . at a summit in brussels on march 20 , the eu member states agreed on an extra 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , as well as a further 25 billion euros in emergency credit for eastern europe .
with that , the union appeared to have aligned the position it would take at the upcoming g20 summit in london on april 2 .
going by the words of french president nicolas sarkozy at the latest eu summit , it would seem that the european union is marching to london in step as one unit .
" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .
" the clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead , " de boer said .
all eyes on the us the united states ' position will be keenly observed in the coming days , since washington recently changed tack on climate change with the inauguration of president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us climate envoy todd stern former us president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , but it was never ratified .
the white house on saturday invited the un and 16 major economies to washington to prepare for international efforts to reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions .
" the us will be powerfully and fervently engaged in this process , " obama 's climate negotiator , todd stern said on sunday .
but he cautioned against unrealistic expectations that the united states could " wave a magic wand " and find solutions to all problems .
" i do n't think anybody should be thinking that the us can ride in on a white horse and make it all work , " he said .
the chinese puzzle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is a major greenhouse gas emitter in particular , washington wants to see china increase its commitment to emissions reduction , since the country 's economic growth made it one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors .
china and the us between them account for more than 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions .
" if you do the math , you simply can not be anywhere near where science tells us we need to be if you do n't have china involved , as well also other major developing countries , " he said .
the kyoto protocol was lenient on developing countries such as china , india and brazil .
this is to change in the document to be signed in copenhagen .

some 371 landmarks powered down worldwide , including the eiffel tower , niagara falls , the las vegas casino strip and beijing 's " bird 's nest " olympic stadium .
the switch-off ended in honolulu , capital of the us state of hawaii .
residents of the chatham islands , a territory of new zealand in the southern pacific ocean , turned off light switches and kicked off the global earth hour .
one of the event 's dramatic episodes occurred in sydney , where the iconic opera house and harbour bridge plunged into darkness on saturday night , killing their lights for an hour .
millions of people turned out in sydney , while melbourne , australia 's second-largest city , came to life with a pedal-powered concert and others enjoyed moonlit picnics and barbecues .
the global grassroots movement began in sydney two years ago , when 2.2 million people switched off their lights .
earth hour has since grown to include 3,929 cities , villages and localities across the globe .
" it is a very positive , hopeful campaign , " andy ridley , the event 's director , told reporters in sydney .
" we want people to think , even if it is for an hour , what they can do to lower their carbon footprint and take that beyond the hour . "
organizers send message to world leaders ridley said he was aiming for one billion participants , hoping the event would send a resounding message to world leaders about significant emissions cuts .
scientists have warned that global warming caused by burning fossil fuels on a massive scale could devastate the planet , hitting the poorest countries hardest with floods , droughts and disease .
sceptics criticized the event as little more than empty symbolism , with danish professor bjorn lomborg claiming the use of candles during the hour could produce more emissions than electric lights .
but united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a video message earlier this month that " earth hour is a way for the citizens of the world to send a clear message .
they want action on climate change . "
lights in the " city that never sleeps " began going dark at 8:30 pm -lrb- 0130 cet -rrb- at some of new york city 's most renowned buildings and landmarks , including broadway theaters , the empire state building , the chrysler building and the signs of several big firms , including coca-cola 's in times square .
in washington , campuses of major universities and several embassies flipped the switch .
people gathered at freedom plaza , which has an unobstructed view of the us congress , to watch the lights dim on nearby buildings and hotels .
iconic structures plunged into darkness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden gate bridge added its weight to the message in london , the lights went off at the houses of parliament and the famous electronic billboard at piccadilly circus .
in paris , hundreds of monuments and buildings , from the louvre and notre dame cathedral to the arc de triomphe , all went dark .
for safety reasons , the lights on the eiffel tower were switched off for only five minutes .
elsewhere across europe , st peter 's basilica in rome and the greek parliament in athens were all plunged into darkness , while entertainers danced in front of the romanian parliament in bucharest .
in egypt , the giza pyramids , the cairo tower and the alexandria library on the mediterranean all went dark .
in the united arab emirates , which has the highest per capita energy consumption in the world , dubai 's iconic sail-shaped seven-star burj al arab hotel turned off its nightly multi-colored light show .
the lights went dark in downtown manila , as they did in the world 's tallest completed skyscraper , the taipei 101 building .
in south africa , table mountain was to be seen only by starlight for an hour .
and the weekender newspaper reported that one couple would turn the lights down on their marriage at a vineyard near cape town .
the event ended in honolulu , where municipal buildings darkened for the second consecutive year to mark the eco-friendly hour , according to local news reports .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : g20 summit in london can europe help developing countries out of the crisis ?
germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 eu aims to present united front at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can 27 nations really march in one direction ?
after refining its economic positions at a recent summit , the eu seems ready to present a united front at the upcoming g20 talks in london .
but some issues are still being fought over within the 27-member bloc . at a summit in brussels on march 20 , the eu member states agreed on an extra 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , as well as a further 25 billion euros in emergency credit for eastern europe .
with that , the union appeared to have aligned the position it would take at the upcoming g20 summit in london on april 2 .
going by the words of french president nicolas sarkozy at the latest eu summit , it would seem that the european union is marching to london in step as one unit .
" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 eu aims to present united front at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can 27 nations really march in one direction ?
after refining its economic positions at a recent summit , the eu seems ready to present a united front at the upcoming g20 talks in london .
but some issues are still being fought over within the 27-member bloc . at a summit in brussels on march 20 , the eu member states agreed on an extra 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , as well as a further 25 billion euros in emergency credit for eastern europe .
with that , the union appeared to have aligned the position it would take at the upcoming g20 summit in london on april 2 .
going by the words of french president nicolas sarkozy at the latest eu summit , it would seem that the european union is marching to london in step as one unit .
" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

in the long term however , the german government bank bailout agency soffin is to take complete control of the bank , hre said .
soffin is to purchase 20 million shares at a price of three euros each , granting a 60-million-euro -lrb- $ 80.1-million -rrb- capital injection to hre .
the current shareholders will initially remain on board .
" -lrb- soffin -rrb- intends to take action to stabilize hypo real estate group , in the interest of stabilizing the financial markets , " soffin said .
" soffin will implement measures to achieve a sufficient recapitalization " of hre , the statement added .
however , the prerequisite for soffin to stabilize the ailing bank is said to be a complete state takeover , either through the bailout fund or by direct government intervention .
" to this end it is intended to make use of the options that will be provided by the german financial markets stabilization amendment act , which is currently being discussed in the legislative process , " a statement on the bank 's website said .
the act , which specifies the conditions for a state expropriation of hre , has been approved by germany 's lower house of parliament .
state ministers are expected to grant their approval in an upper house consultation due friday .
berlin moves to avert catastrophic bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doomed lehman brothers could have brought down hre berlin is concerned that the failure of hre could have catastrophic consequences similar to those sparked by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september , which hit financial markets around the world .
the head of hre said sunday the state 's purchase of the 8.7 percent stake in the bank would allow it to survive despite expected losses for the next two years .
chief executive axel wieandt hailed the government 's purchase of 20 million shares as " good news . "
" with the proposed long-term liquidity and capital support , the federal republic ... has put in place the necessary requirements for hre to continue , " wieandt said in a statement .
" we welcome this step .
it is in the interests of the company and clearly good news , " he added .
the purchase of hre shares - at the minimum legal price of three euros per share - is an " important signal , an important first step , " he said .
" the stabilization and rescue of hre must succeed .
it is in everyone 's interests , " the chief executive stressed .
however , he acknowledged that the bank expected to be " in a loss situation for at least the next two years . "
" nevertheless , we see our medium-term strategic prospects as positive , " he said .
hre announces hefty losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre 's wieandt was understandably pleased hre also released its unaudited earnings statement for 2008 , reporting a hefty net loss of 5.46 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.25 billion -rrb- due largely to write-downs on intangible assets .
" this result very much reflects the difficult situation on the capital and financing markets , " the bank said in the earnings statement .
the pre-tax loss was 5.375 billion , it said , compared to pre-tax profits of 862 million euros in 2007 .
it said hre expected to make losses until at least 2011 .
" the financial year 2008 reflects the impact of the general crisis on the international financial markets and the specific extremely difficult situation for the hypo real estate group , " wieandt , said in a statement .
hre said in its earnings statement that complex " derivative " investments with lehman brothers had been the main cause of a 150-million-euro expense on its own balance sheet .
it said it was also hit by losses linked to icelandic banks , which were largely wiped out by the financial crisis last year .
hre has already benefited from more than 100 billion euros in private and public aid to keep it afloat . nda / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 eu aims to present united front at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can 27 nations really march in one direction ?
after refining its economic positions at a recent summit , the eu seems ready to present a united front at the upcoming g20 talks in london .
but some issues are still being fought over within the 27-member bloc . at a summit in brussels on march 20 , the eu member states agreed on an extra 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , as well as a further 25 billion euros in emergency credit for eastern europe .
with that , the union appeared to have aligned the position it would take at the upcoming g20 summit in london on april 2 .
going by the words of french president nicolas sarkozy at the latest eu summit , it would seem that the european union is marching to london in step as one unit .
" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

some 371 landmarks powered down worldwide , including the eiffel tower , niagara falls , the las vegas casino strip and beijing 's " bird 's nest " olympic stadium .
the switch-off ended in honolulu , capital of the us state of hawaii .
residents of the chatham islands , a territory of new zealand in the southern pacific ocean , turned off light switches and kicked off the global earth hour .
one of the event 's dramatic episodes occurred in sydney , where the iconic opera house and harbour bridge plunged into darkness on saturday night , killing their lights for an hour .
millions of people turned out in sydney , while melbourne , australia 's second-largest city , came to life with a pedal-powered concert and others enjoyed moonlit picnics and barbecues .
the global grassroots movement began in sydney two years ago , when 2.2 million people switched off their lights .
earth hour has since grown to include 3,929 cities , villages and localities across the globe .
" it is a very positive , hopeful campaign , " andy ridley , the event 's director , told reporters in sydney .
" we want people to think , even if it is for an hour , what they can do to lower their carbon footprint and take that beyond the hour . "
organizers send message to world leaders ridley said he was aiming for one billion participants , hoping the event would send a resounding message to world leaders about significant emissions cuts .
scientists have warned that global warming caused by burning fossil fuels on a massive scale could devastate the planet , hitting the poorest countries hardest with floods , droughts and disease .
sceptics criticized the event as little more than empty symbolism , with danish professor bjorn lomborg claiming the use of candles during the hour could produce more emissions than electric lights .
but united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a video message earlier this month that " earth hour is a way for the citizens of the world to send a clear message .
they want action on climate change . "
lights in the " city that never sleeps " began going dark at 8:30 pm -lrb- 0130 cet -rrb- at some of new york city 's most renowned buildings and landmarks , including broadway theaters , the empire state building , the chrysler building and the signs of several big firms , including coca-cola 's in times square .

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .
" the clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead , " de boer said .
all eyes on the us the united states ' position will be keenly observed in the coming days , since washington recently changed tack on climate change with the inauguration of president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us climate envoy todd stern former us president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , but it was never ratified .
the white house on saturday invited the un and 16 major economies to washington to prepare for international efforts to reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions .
" the us will be powerfully and fervently engaged in this process , " obama 's climate negotiator , todd stern said on sunday .
but he cautioned against unrealistic expectations that the united states could " wave a magic wand " and find solutions to all problems .
" i do n't think anybody should be thinking that the us can ride in on a white horse and make it all work , " he said .
the chinese puzzle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is a major greenhouse gas emitter in particular , washington wants to see china increase its commitment to emissions reduction , since the country 's economic growth made it one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors .
china and the us between them account for more than 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions .
" if you do the math , you simply can not be anywhere near where science tells us we need to be if you do n't have china involved , as well also other major developing countries , " he said .
the kyoto protocol was lenient on developing countries such as china , india and brazil .
this is to change in the document to be signed in copenhagen .
de boer welcomed obama 's initiative , saying it could be " useful " to find a political solution to the climate change talks . tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

celebrations will include a special exhibition at the city 's bauhaus museum . bauhaus might be turning 90 , but for enthusiasts of the german design movement , the art , furniture and architecture it inspired still looks fresh and young .
the school was founded in 1919 by architect walter gropius , who wanted to create something bold and forward-thinking in the wake of world war i , which he described as a " catastrophe of world history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus classics designed by marcel breuer and ludwig mies van der rohe gropius was 35 when he applied to the city of weimar to establish an academy there .
by the time he received his permit , he 'd penned a manifesto which would prove to be the beginning of an aesthetic upheaval that would reach far beyond germany 's borders .
in a pamphlet he wrote for an april 1919 exhibition entitled " exhibition of unknown architects , " gropius described his goal as being " to create a new guild of craftsmen , without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist . "
he argued that a new era had begun with the end of the war , and he wanted a new architectural style to reflect this .
crucially , he advocated architecture and consumer goods that were functional , inexpensive and consistent with the industrialization and mass production that was changing the face of europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus buildings in dessau , shown here , and weimar are unesco world heritage sites the school existed in three german cities : weimar -lrb- 1919 -1925 -rrb- , dessau -lrb- 1925 - 1932 -rrb- and berlin -lrb- 1932 - 1933 -rrb- .
in 1933 , it was closed by the nazi regime .
during its years of operation , the school attracted avant garde artists such as wassily kandinsky , paul klee and lyonel feininger .
along with gropius , hannes meyer and ludwig mies van der rohe acted as architect-directors .
bauhaus spirit lives on but although the original bauhaus school had a relatively short lifespan , the bauhaus principles and aesthetic have lived on and served as the inspiration for more schools of design , particularly in the united states , where many of those associated with the bauhaus movement settled in the 1930s .
today , the bauhaus school is called the bauhaus university of weimar .
although weimar is commonly seen as the cradle of great german literary figures such as goethe and schiller , the popularity of bauhaus has also contributed to the city becoming a popular tourist destination in recent years .
many designers are taking the 90th anniversary as an occasion to bring remakes of bauhaus classics to the market .
at the interior design trade show ambiente in mid-february in frankfurt , a number of porcelain and glassmakers showed variations of designs that originated at the bauhaus school .
examples include tea sets by kpm in berlin and by rosenthal in selb .
gropius designed the tac collection in 1969 for rosenthal , which is offering the set in the bauhaus colors of blue , yellow and red to mark the anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamps in the bauhaus style a highlight of the bauhaus anniversary week celebrations in weimar will be the 11th international bauhaus colloquium featuring architectural experts from around the world debating the political and ethical challenges of globalization , and how architecture responds to them .
the bauhaus colloquia are highly-regarded conferences on architectural theory and have been held regularly since 1976 .

celebrations will include a special exhibition at the city 's bauhaus museum . bauhaus might be turning 90 , but for enthusiasts of the german design movement , the art , furniture and architecture it inspired still looks fresh and young .
the school was founded in 1919 by architect walter gropius , who wanted to create something bold and forward-thinking in the wake of world war i , which he described as a " catastrophe of world history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus classics designed by marcel breuer and ludwig mies van der rohe gropius was 35 when he applied to the city of weimar to establish an academy there .
by the time he received his permit , he 'd penned a manifesto which would prove to be the beginning of an aesthetic upheaval that would reach far beyond germany 's borders .
in a pamphlet he wrote for an april 1919 exhibition entitled " exhibition of unknown architects , " gropius described his goal as being " to create a new guild of craftsmen , without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist . "
he argued that a new era had begun with the end of the war , and he wanted a new architectural style to reflect this .
crucially , he advocated architecture and consumer goods that were functional , inexpensive and consistent with the industrialization and mass production that was changing the face of europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus buildings in dessau , shown here , and weimar are unesco world heritage sites the school existed in three german cities : weimar -lrb- 1919 -1925 -rrb- , dessau -lrb- 1925 - 1932 -rrb- and berlin -lrb- 1932 - 1933 -rrb- .
in 1933 , it was closed by the nazi regime .
during its years of operation , the school attracted avant garde artists such as wassily kandinsky , paul klee and lyonel feininger .
along with gropius , hannes meyer and ludwig mies van der rohe acted as architect-directors .
bauhaus spirit lives on but although the original bauhaus school had a relatively short lifespan , the bauhaus principles and aesthetic have lived on and served as the inspiration for more schools of design , particularly in the united states , where many of those associated with the bauhaus movement settled in the 1930s .
today , the bauhaus school is called the bauhaus university of weimar .
although weimar is commonly seen as the cradle of great german literary figures such as goethe and schiller , the popularity of bauhaus has also contributed to the city becoming a popular tourist destination in recent years .
many designers are taking the 90th anniversary as an occasion to bring remakes of bauhaus classics to the market .
at the interior design trade show ambiente in mid-february in frankfurt , a number of porcelain and glassmakers showed variations of designs that originated at the bauhaus school .
examples include tea sets by kpm in berlin and by rosenthal in selb .
gropius designed the tac collection in 1969 for rosenthal , which is offering the set in the bauhaus colors of blue , yellow and red to mark the anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamps in the bauhaus style a highlight of the bauhaus anniversary week celebrations in weimar will be the 11th international bauhaus colloquium featuring architectural experts from around the world debating the political and ethical challenges of globalization , and how architecture responds to them .
the bauhaus colloquia are highly-regarded conferences on architectural theory and have been held regularly since 1976 .
meanwhile , weimar is already looking ahead a decade to the bauhaus centenary , and plans to open a new museum dedicated to the movement in 2019 . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the long term however , the german government bank bailout agency soffin is to take complete control of the bank , hre said .
soffin is to purchase 20 million shares at a price of three euros each , granting a 60-million-euro -lrb- $ 80.1-million -rrb- capital injection to hre .
the current shareholders will initially remain on board .
" -lrb- soffin -rrb- intends to take action to stabilize hypo real estate group , in the interest of stabilizing the financial markets , " soffin said .
" soffin will implement measures to achieve a sufficient recapitalization " of hre , the statement added .
however , the prerequisite for soffin to stabilize the ailing bank is said to be a complete state takeover , either through the bailout fund or by direct government intervention .
" to this end it is intended to make use of the options that will be provided by the german financial markets stabilization amendment act , which is currently being discussed in the legislative process , " a statement on the bank 's website said .
the act , which specifies the conditions for a state expropriation of hre , has been approved by germany 's lower house of parliament .
state ministers are expected to grant their approval in an upper house consultation due friday .
berlin moves to avert catastrophic bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doomed lehman brothers could have brought down hre berlin is concerned that the failure of hre could have catastrophic consequences similar to those sparked by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september , which hit financial markets around the world .
the head of hre said sunday the state 's purchase of the 8.7 percent stake in the bank would allow it to survive despite expected losses for the next two years .
chief executive axel wieandt hailed the government 's purchase of 20 million shares as " good news . "
" with the proposed long-term liquidity and capital support , the federal republic ... has put in place the necessary requirements for hre to continue , " wieandt said in a statement .
" we welcome this step .
it is in the interests of the company and clearly good news , " he added .
the purchase of hre shares - at the minimum legal price of three euros per share - is an " important signal , an important first step , " he said .
" the stabilization and rescue of hre must succeed .
it is in everyone 's interests , " the chief executive stressed .
however , he acknowledged that the bank expected to be " in a loss situation for at least the next two years . "
" nevertheless , we see our medium-term strategic prospects as positive , " he said .

after refining its economic positions at a recent summit , the eu seems ready to present a united front at the upcoming g20 talks in london .
but some issues are still being fought over within the 27-member bloc . at a summit in brussels on march 20 , the eu member states agreed on an extra 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , as well as a further 25 billion euros in emergency credit for eastern europe .
with that , the union appeared to have aligned the position it would take at the upcoming g20 summit in london on april 2 .
going by the words of french president nicolas sarkozy at the latest eu summit , it would seem that the european union is marching to london in step as one unit .
" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

in the long term however , the german government bank bailout agency soffin is to take complete control of the bank , hre said .
soffin is to purchase 20 million shares at a price of three euros each , granting a 60-million-euro -lrb- $ 80.1-million -rrb- capital injection to hre .
the current shareholders will initially remain on board .
" -lrb- soffin -rrb- intends to take action to stabilize hypo real estate group , in the interest of stabilizing the financial markets , " soffin said .
" soffin will implement measures to achieve a sufficient recapitalization " of hre , the statement added .
however , the prerequisite for soffin to stabilize the ailing bank is said to be a complete state takeover , either through the bailout fund or by direct government intervention .
" to this end it is intended to make use of the options that will be provided by the german financial markets stabilization amendment act , which is currently being discussed in the legislative process , " a statement on the bank 's website said .
the act , which specifies the conditions for a state expropriation of hre , has been approved by germany 's lower house of parliament .
state ministers are expected to grant their approval in an upper house consultation due friday .
berlin moves to avert catastrophic bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doomed lehman brothers could have brought down hre berlin is concerned that the failure of hre could have catastrophic consequences similar to those sparked by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september , which hit financial markets around the world .
the head of hre said sunday the state 's purchase of the 8.7 percent stake in the bank would allow it to survive despite expected losses for the next two years .
chief executive axel wieandt hailed the government 's purchase of 20 million shares as " good news . "
" with the proposed long-term liquidity and capital support , the federal republic ... has put in place the necessary requirements for hre to continue , " wieandt said in a statement .
" we welcome this step .
it is in the interests of the company and clearly good news , " he added .
the purchase of hre shares - at the minimum legal price of three euros per share - is an " important signal , an important first step , " he said .
" the stabilization and rescue of hre must succeed .
it is in everyone 's interests , " the chief executive stressed .
however , he acknowledged that the bank expected to be " in a loss situation for at least the next two years . "
" nevertheless , we see our medium-term strategic prospects as positive , " he said .
hre announces hefty losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre 's wieandt was understandably pleased hre also released its unaudited earnings statement for 2008 , reporting a hefty net loss of 5.46 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.25 billion -rrb- due largely to write-downs on intangible assets .
" this result very much reflects the difficult situation on the capital and financing markets , " the bank said in the earnings statement .
the pre-tax loss was 5.375 billion , it said , compared to pre-tax profits of 862 million euros in 2007 .
it said hre expected to make losses until at least 2011 .
" the financial year 2008 reflects the impact of the general crisis on the international financial markets and the specific extremely difficult situation for the hypo real estate group , " wieandt , said in a statement .
hre said in its earnings statement that complex " derivative " investments with lehman brothers had been the main cause of a 150-million-euro expense on its own balance sheet .
it said it was also hit by losses linked to icelandic banks , which were largely wiped out by the financial crisis last year .

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .
" the clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead , " de boer said .
all eyes on the us the united states ' position will be keenly observed in the coming days , since washington recently changed tack on climate change with the inauguration of president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us climate envoy todd stern former us president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , but it was never ratified .
the white house on saturday invited the un and 16 major economies to washington to prepare for international efforts to reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions .
" the us will be powerfully and fervently engaged in this process , " obama 's climate negotiator , todd stern said on sunday .
but he cautioned against unrealistic expectations that the united states could " wave a magic wand " and find solutions to all problems .
" i do n't think anybody should be thinking that the us can ride in on a white horse and make it all work , " he said .
the chinese puzzle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is a major greenhouse gas emitter in particular , washington wants to see china increase its commitment to emissions reduction , since the country 's economic growth made it one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors .
china and the us between them account for more than 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions .
" if you do the math , you simply can not be anywhere near where science tells us we need to be if you do n't have china involved , as well also other major developing countries , " he said .
the kyoto protocol was lenient on developing countries such as china , india and brazil .
this is to change in the document to be signed in copenhagen .
de boer welcomed obama 's initiative , saying it could be " useful " to find a political solution to the climate change talks . tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 eu aims to present united front at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can 27 nations really march in one direction ?
after refining its economic positions at a recent summit , the eu seems ready to present a united front at the upcoming g20 talks in london .
but some issues are still being fought over within the 27-member bloc . at a summit in brussels on march 20 , the eu member states agreed on an extra 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , as well as a further 25 billion euros in emergency credit for eastern europe .
with that , the union appeared to have aligned the position it would take at the upcoming g20 summit in london on april 2 .
going by the words of french president nicolas sarkozy at the latest eu summit , it would seem that the european union is marching to london in step as one unit .
" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

marcell jansen , bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski got the other goals .
germany top group 4 with 13 points from five games ahead of russia , who have nine from four games .
only the group winner qualifies directly for the 2010 finals in south africa .
" we have fulfilled our duty , " said germany coach joachim loew .
" we had expected liechtenstein would defend with nine or ten men .
obviously , we would have liked to have scored a few more goals , but i am quite content . "
liechtenstein coach hans-peter zaugg admitted afterwards this was a good result for them and germany 's stars had expected more goals .
liechtenstein goalkeeper peter jehle said : " i am a little disappointed how we conceded the goals early in each half .

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .
" the clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead , " de boer said .
all eyes on the us the united states ' position will be keenly observed in the coming days , since washington recently changed tack on climate change with the inauguration of president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us climate envoy todd stern former us president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , but it was never ratified .

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .

marcell jansen , bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski got the other goals .
germany top group 4 with 13 points from five games ahead of russia , who have nine from four games .
only the group winner qualifies directly for the 2010 finals in south africa .
" we have fulfilled our duty , " said germany coach joachim loew .
" we had expected liechtenstein would defend with nine or ten men .
obviously , we would have liked to have scored a few more goals , but i am quite content . "
liechtenstein coach hans-peter zaugg admitted afterwards this was a good result for them and germany 's stars had expected more goals .
liechtenstein goalkeeper peter jehle said : " i am a little disappointed how we conceded the goals early in each half .
we made life too easy for the germans but in the end we played a decent match . "
loew had to make several changes due to injuries concerning among others striker miroslav klose , midfielder torsten frings and defender arne friedrich .
tsg hoffenheim defender andreas beck started for a first time and hanover 's robert enke returned between the posts from a hand fracture .
germany were determined from the start to make up for home defeats against england and norway in their last two -lrb- friendly -rrb- matches , with mario gomez heading wide just 16 seconds into the game .
chelsea midfielder ballack broke the deadlock in the fourth minute with a stunning volley high into the net off schweinsteiger 's cross .
just five minutes later sv hamburg 's jansen doubled the lead on the rebound from podolski 's shot saved which had been saved by jehle .
avalanche of goals fails to materialize the fans naturally hoped for plenty goals but the germans then showed a lack of precision until the break , and the second half passed in identical fashion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweini added a goal to give germany a 3-0 lead schweinsteiger made victory secure when he scored the third goal in the 48th when he hit the empty net after an initial shot from his bayern munich team-mate podolski , who then found the net himself two minutes later .
enke had to make only one save , in the 54th against mario frick , while up front most notably vfb stuttgart forward mario gomez failed to score as his germany drought now covers almost one year .
germany next visit wales , 2-0 losers against finland saturday , on wednesday .
the same day liechtenstein host russia .
" i am pleased with the victory , but now much harder tasks lie ahead for us , " said ballack whose side face russia next october in moscow in the game which is likely to decide the group .

the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .
g8 ministers meet to discuss " human dimension " meanwhile in rome on sunday , labor ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- and six other major economies gathered for talks on the " human dimension " of the financial crisis sweeping the planet .

the g14 " social summit " in rome will urge the g20 to put " people first " as they discuss economic recovery strategies and reforms to the financial regulatory system , italian labour minister maurizio sacconi said .
sacconi said the g14 would advocate a " global pact " to ensure sustainable social protections , investment in people , notably skills development , and job creation , especially in the areas of environmental protection , health and education .
imf chief dominique strauss-kahn warned last week that " dramatic " rises in unemployment around the world would set the stage for conflict .
social unrest fears gather credence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests , like this one in paris , have been peaceful so far the world financial crisis could spark " social unrest , some threats to democracy and maybe for some cases , it can also end in war , " he warned during an international labour organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- meeting in geneva .
the ilo in january said the global financial meltdown could claim up to 50 million jobs over 2008 and 2009 , while the world bank warned that the crisis could push 46 million back into poverty .
ilo chief juan somavia will stress in rome " that we are confronting an inter-connected financial , economic and social crisis , and that the attention of policy makers should turn to the three crises at the same time , " his deputy philippe egger said last week .
tens of thousands of people demonstrated in london , rome , berlin and other cities on saturday to express their anger at the human cost of the financial crisis .
organizers of the put people first march for " jobs , justice and climate " in london had rejected as " smears " claims in police briefings that marches could be hijacked by anarchists bent on violence .

g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .

the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .

least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .

the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .

while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .
g8 ministers meet to discuss " human dimension " meanwhile in rome on sunday , labor ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- and six other major economies gathered for talks on the " human dimension " of the financial crisis sweeping the planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment is rising around the world due ´ to the crisis the three-day " group of 14 " meeting will bring together the g8 leading industrial powers with the emerging giants china , india and brazil as well as mexico , south africa and egypt at a time when worldwide job losses are sparking fears of social unrest .
the g14 " social summit " in rome will urge the g20 to put " people first " as they discuss economic recovery strategies and reforms to the financial regulatory system , italian labour minister maurizio sacconi said .
sacconi said the g14 would advocate a " global pact " to ensure sustainable social protections , investment in people , notably skills development , and job creation , especially in the areas of environmental protection , health and education .
imf chief dominique strauss-kahn warned last week that " dramatic " rises in unemployment around the world would set the stage for conflict .
social unrest fears gather credence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests , like this one in paris , have been peaceful so far the world financial crisis could spark " social unrest , some threats to democracy and maybe for some cases , it can also end in war , " he warned during an international labour organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- meeting in geneva .
the ilo in january said the global financial meltdown could claim up to 50 million jobs over 2008 and 2009 , while the world bank warned that the crisis could push 46 million back into poverty .
ilo chief juan somavia will stress in rome " that we are confronting an inter-connected financial , economic and social crisis , and that the attention of policy makers should turn to the three crises at the same time , " his deputy philippe egger said last week .
tens of thousands of people demonstrated in london , rome , berlin and other cities on saturday to express their anger at the human cost of the financial crisis .
organizers of the put people first march for " jobs , justice and climate " in london had rejected as " smears " claims in police briefings that marches could be hijacked by anarchists bent on violence .
france last week saw more than a million workers take to the streets in a nationwide strike to force president sarkozy to boost wages and protect jobs .
a protest in paris left nine police officers injured and led to some 300 arrests . nda / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 29.03.2009 celebrations mark 90 years of bauhaus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus masters in a group photo bauhaus , the modern design movement that originated in the eastern german city of weimar , marks its 90th birthday on april 1 .
celebrations will include a special exhibition at the city 's bauhaus museum . bauhaus might be turning 90 , but for enthusiasts of the german design movement , the art , furniture and architecture it inspired still looks fresh and young .
the school was founded in 1919 by architect walter gropius , who wanted to create something bold and forward-thinking in the wake of world war i , which he described as a " catastrophe of world history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus classics designed by marcel breuer and ludwig mies van der rohe gropius was 35 when he applied to the city of weimar to establish an academy there .
by the time he received his permit , he 'd penned a manifesto which would prove to be the beginning of an aesthetic upheaval that would reach far beyond germany 's borders .
in a pamphlet he wrote for an april 1919 exhibition entitled " exhibition of unknown architects , " gropius described his goal as being " to create a new guild of craftsmen , without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist . "
he argued that a new era had begun with the end of the war , and he wanted a new architectural style to reflect this .
crucially , he advocated architecture and consumer goods that were functional , inexpensive and consistent with the industrialization and mass production that was changing the face of europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus buildings in dessau , shown here , and weimar are unesco world heritage sites the school existed in three german cities : weimar -lrb- 1919 -1925 -rrb- , dessau -lrb- 1925 - 1932 -rrb- and berlin -lrb- 1932 - 1933 -rrb- .
in 1933 , it was closed by the nazi regime .
during its years of operation , the school attracted avant garde artists such as wassily kandinsky , paul klee and lyonel feininger .
along with gropius , hannes meyer and ludwig mies van der rohe acted as architect-directors .
bauhaus spirit lives on but although the original bauhaus school had a relatively short lifespan , the bauhaus principles and aesthetic have lived on and served as the inspiration for more schools of design , particularly in the united states , where many of those associated with the bauhaus movement settled in the 1930s .
today , the bauhaus school is called the bauhaus university of weimar .
although weimar is commonly seen as the cradle of great german literary figures such as goethe and schiller , the popularity of bauhaus has also contributed to the city becoming a popular tourist destination in recent years .
many designers are taking the 90th anniversary as an occasion to bring remakes of bauhaus classics to the market .
at the interior design trade show ambiente in mid-february in frankfurt , a number of porcelain and glassmakers showed variations of designs that originated at the bauhaus school .
examples include tea sets by kpm in berlin and by rosenthal in selb .
gropius designed the tac collection in 1969 for rosenthal , which is offering the set in the bauhaus colors of blue , yellow and red to mark the anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamps in the bauhaus style a highlight of the bauhaus anniversary week celebrations in weimar will be the 11th international bauhaus colloquium featuring architectural experts from around the world debating the political and ethical challenges of globalization , and how architecture responds to them .
the bauhaus colloquia are highly-regarded conferences on architectural theory and have been held regularly since 1976 .
meanwhile , weimar is already looking ahead a decade to the bauhaus centenary , and plans to open a new museum dedicated to the movement in 2019 . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 29.03.2009 celebrations mark 90 years of bauhaus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus masters in a group photo bauhaus , the modern design movement that originated in the eastern german city of weimar , marks its 90th birthday on april 1 .
celebrations will include a special exhibition at the city 's bauhaus museum . bauhaus might be turning 90 , but for enthusiasts of the german design movement , the art , furniture and architecture it inspired still looks fresh and young .
the school was founded in 1919 by architect walter gropius , who wanted to create something bold and forward-thinking in the wake of world war i , which he described as a " catastrophe of world history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus classics designed by marcel breuer and ludwig mies van der rohe gropius was 35 when he applied to the city of weimar to establish an academy there .
by the time he received his permit , he 'd penned a manifesto which would prove to be the beginning of an aesthetic upheaval that would reach far beyond germany 's borders .
in a pamphlet he wrote for an april 1919 exhibition entitled " exhibition of unknown architects , " gropius described his goal as being " to create a new guild of craftsmen , without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist . "
he argued that a new era had begun with the end of the war , and he wanted a new architectural style to reflect this .
crucially , he advocated architecture and consumer goods that were functional , inexpensive and consistent with the industrialization and mass production that was changing the face of europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus buildings in dessau , shown here , and weimar are unesco world heritage sites the school existed in three german cities : weimar -lrb- 1919 -1925 -rrb- , dessau -lrb- 1925 - 1932 -rrb- and berlin -lrb- 1932 - 1933 -rrb- .
in 1933 , it was closed by the nazi regime .
during its years of operation , the school attracted avant garde artists such as wassily kandinsky , paul klee and lyonel feininger .
along with gropius , hannes meyer and ludwig mies van der rohe acted as architect-directors .
bauhaus spirit lives on but although the original bauhaus school had a relatively short lifespan , the bauhaus principles and aesthetic have lived on and served as the inspiration for more schools of design , particularly in the united states , where many of those associated with the bauhaus movement settled in the 1930s .
today , the bauhaus school is called the bauhaus university of weimar .
although weimar is commonly seen as the cradle of great german literary figures such as goethe and schiller , the popularity of bauhaus has also contributed to the city becoming a popular tourist destination in recent years .
many designers are taking the 90th anniversary as an occasion to bring remakes of bauhaus classics to the market .
at the interior design trade show ambiente in mid-february in frankfurt , a number of porcelain and glassmakers showed variations of designs that originated at the bauhaus school .
examples include tea sets by kpm in berlin and by rosenthal in selb .
gropius designed the tac collection in 1969 for rosenthal , which is offering the set in the bauhaus colors of blue , yellow and red to mark the anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamps in the bauhaus style a highlight of the bauhaus anniversary week celebrations in weimar will be the 11th international bauhaus colloquium featuring architectural experts from around the world debating the political and ethical challenges of globalization , and how architecture responds to them .
the bauhaus colloquia are highly-regarded conferences on architectural theory and have been held regularly since 1976 .
meanwhile , weimar is already looking ahead a decade to the bauhaus centenary , and plans to open a new museum dedicated to the movement in 2019 . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

celebrations will include a special exhibition at the city 's bauhaus museum . bauhaus might be turning 90 , but for enthusiasts of the german design movement , the art , furniture and architecture it inspired still looks fresh and young .
the school was founded in 1919 by architect walter gropius , who wanted to create something bold and forward-thinking in the wake of world war i , which he described as a " catastrophe of world history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus classics designed by marcel breuer and ludwig mies van der rohe gropius was 35 when he applied to the city of weimar to establish an academy there .
by the time he received his permit , he 'd penned a manifesto which would prove to be the beginning of an aesthetic upheaval that would reach far beyond germany 's borders .
in a pamphlet he wrote for an april 1919 exhibition entitled " exhibition of unknown architects , " gropius described his goal as being " to create a new guild of craftsmen , without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist . "
he argued that a new era had begun with the end of the war , and he wanted a new architectural style to reflect this .
crucially , he advocated architecture and consumer goods that were functional , inexpensive and consistent with the industrialization and mass production that was changing the face of europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus buildings in dessau , shown here , and weimar are unesco world heritage sites the school existed in three german cities : weimar -lrb- 1919 -1925 -rrb- , dessau -lrb- 1925 - 1932 -rrb- and berlin -lrb- 1932 - 1933 -rrb- .
in 1933 , it was closed by the nazi regime .
during its years of operation , the school attracted avant garde artists such as wassily kandinsky , paul klee and lyonel feininger .
along with gropius , hannes meyer and ludwig mies van der rohe acted as architect-directors .
bauhaus spirit lives on but although the original bauhaus school had a relatively short lifespan , the bauhaus principles and aesthetic have lived on and served as the inspiration for more schools of design , particularly in the united states , where many of those associated with the bauhaus movement settled in the 1930s .
today , the bauhaus school is called the bauhaus university of weimar .
although weimar is commonly seen as the cradle of great german literary figures such as goethe and schiller , the popularity of bauhaus has also contributed to the city becoming a popular tourist destination in recent years .
many designers are taking the 90th anniversary as an occasion to bring remakes of bauhaus classics to the market .
at the interior design trade show ambiente in mid-february in frankfurt , a number of porcelain and glassmakers showed variations of designs that originated at the bauhaus school .
examples include tea sets by kpm in berlin and by rosenthal in selb .
gropius designed the tac collection in 1969 for rosenthal , which is offering the set in the bauhaus colors of blue , yellow and red to mark the anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamps in the bauhaus style a highlight of the bauhaus anniversary week celebrations in weimar will be the 11th international bauhaus colloquium featuring architectural experts from around the world debating the political and ethical challenges of globalization , and how architecture responds to them .
the bauhaus colloquia are highly-regarded conferences on architectural theory and have been held regularly since 1976 .
meanwhile , weimar is already looking ahead a decade to the bauhaus centenary , and plans to open a new museum dedicated to the movement in 2019 . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the long term however , the german government bank bailout agency soffin is to take complete control of the bank , hre said .
soffin is to purchase 20 million shares at a price of three euros each , granting a 60-million-euro -lrb- $ 80.1-million -rrb- capital injection to hre .
the current shareholders will initially remain on board .
" -lrb- soffin -rrb- intends to take action to stabilize hypo real estate group , in the interest of stabilizing the financial markets , " soffin said .
" soffin will implement measures to achieve a sufficient recapitalization " of hre , the statement added .
however , the prerequisite for soffin to stabilize the ailing bank is said to be a complete state takeover , either through the bailout fund or by direct government intervention .
" to this end it is intended to make use of the options that will be provided by the german financial markets stabilization amendment act , which is currently being discussed in the legislative process , " a statement on the bank 's website said .
the act , which specifies the conditions for a state expropriation of hre , has been approved by germany 's lower house of parliament .
state ministers are expected to grant their approval in an upper house consultation due friday .
berlin moves to avert catastrophic bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doomed lehman brothers could have brought down hre berlin is concerned that the failure of hre could have catastrophic consequences similar to those sparked by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september , which hit financial markets around the world .
the head of hre said sunday the state 's purchase of the 8.7 percent stake in the bank would allow it to survive despite expected losses for the next two years .
chief executive axel wieandt hailed the government 's purchase of 20 million shares as " good news . "
" with the proposed long-term liquidity and capital support , the federal republic ... has put in place the necessary requirements for hre to continue , " wieandt said in a statement .
" we welcome this step .
it is in the interests of the company and clearly good news , " he added .
the purchase of hre shares - at the minimum legal price of three euros per share - is an " important signal , an important first step , " he said .
" the stabilization and rescue of hre must succeed .
it is in everyone 's interests , " the chief executive stressed .
however , he acknowledged that the bank expected to be " in a loss situation for at least the next two years . "
" nevertheless , we see our medium-term strategic prospects as positive , " he said .
hre announces hefty losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre 's wieandt was understandably pleased hre also released its unaudited earnings statement for 2008 , reporting a hefty net loss of 5.46 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.25 billion -rrb- due largely to write-downs on intangible assets .
" this result very much reflects the difficult situation on the capital and financing markets , " the bank said in the earnings statement .
the pre-tax loss was 5.375 billion , it said , compared to pre-tax profits of 862 million euros in 2007 .
it said hre expected to make losses until at least 2011 .
" the financial year 2008 reflects the impact of the general crisis on the international financial markets and the specific extremely difficult situation for the hypo real estate group , " wieandt , said in a statement .
hre said in its earnings statement that complex " derivative " investments with lehman brothers had been the main cause of a 150-million-euro expense on its own balance sheet .
it said it was also hit by losses linked to icelandic banks , which were largely wiped out by the financial crisis last year .
hre has already benefited from more than 100 billion euros in private and public aid to keep it afloat . nda / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 371 landmarks powered down worldwide , including the eiffel tower , niagara falls , the las vegas casino strip and beijing 's " bird 's nest " olympic stadium .
the switch-off ended in honolulu , capital of the us state of hawaii .
residents of the chatham islands , a territory of new zealand in the southern pacific ocean , turned off light switches and kicked off the global earth hour .
one of the event 's dramatic episodes occurred in sydney , where the iconic opera house and harbour bridge plunged into darkness on saturday night , killing their lights for an hour .
millions of people turned out in sydney , while melbourne , australia 's second-largest city , came to life with a pedal-powered concert and others enjoyed moonlit picnics and barbecues .
the global grassroots movement began in sydney two years ago , when 2.2 million people switched off their lights .
earth hour has since grown to include 3,929 cities , villages and localities across the globe .
" it is a very positive , hopeful campaign , " andy ridley , the event 's director , told reporters in sydney .
" we want people to think , even if it is for an hour , what they can do to lower their carbon footprint and take that beyond the hour . "
organizers send message to world leaders ridley said he was aiming for one billion participants , hoping the event would send a resounding message to world leaders about significant emissions cuts .
scientists have warned that global warming caused by burning fossil fuels on a massive scale could devastate the planet , hitting the poorest countries hardest with floods , droughts and disease .
sceptics criticized the event as little more than empty symbolism , with danish professor bjorn lomborg claiming the use of candles during the hour could produce more emissions than electric lights .
but united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a video message earlier this month that " earth hour is a way for the citizens of the world to send a clear message .
they want action on climate change . "
lights in the " city that never sleeps " began going dark at 8:30 pm -lrb- 0130 cet -rrb- at some of new york city 's most renowned buildings and landmarks , including broadway theaters , the empire state building , the chrysler building and the signs of several big firms , including coca-cola 's in times square .
in washington , campuses of major universities and several embassies flipped the switch .
people gathered at freedom plaza , which has an unobstructed view of the us congress , to watch the lights dim on nearby buildings and hotels .
iconic structures plunged into darkness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden gate bridge added its weight to the message in london , the lights went off at the houses of parliament and the famous electronic billboard at piccadilly circus .
in paris , hundreds of monuments and buildings , from the louvre and notre dame cathedral to the arc de triomphe , all went dark .
for safety reasons , the lights on the eiffel tower were switched off for only five minutes .
elsewhere across europe , st peter 's basilica in rome and the greek parliament in athens were all plunged into darkness , while entertainers danced in front of the romanian parliament in bucharest .
in egypt , the giza pyramids , the cairo tower and the alexandria library on the mediterranean all went dark .
in the united arab emirates , which has the highest per capita energy consumption in the world , dubai 's iconic sail-shaped seven-star burj al arab hotel turned off its nightly multi-colored light show .
the lights went dark in downtown manila , as they did in the world 's tallest completed skyscraper , the taipei 101 building .
in south africa , table mountain was to be seen only by starlight for an hour .
and the weekender newspaper reported that one couple would turn the lights down on their marriage at a vineyard near cape town .
the event ended in honolulu , where municipal buildings darkened for the second consecutive year to mark the eco-friendly hour , according to local news reports .

celebrations will include a special exhibition at the city 's bauhaus museum . bauhaus might be turning 90 , but for enthusiasts of the german design movement , the art , furniture and architecture it inspired still looks fresh and young .
the school was founded in 1919 by architect walter gropius , who wanted to create something bold and forward-thinking in the wake of world war i , which he described as a " catastrophe of world history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus classics designed by marcel breuer and ludwig mies van der rohe gropius was 35 when he applied to the city of weimar to establish an academy there .
by the time he received his permit , he 'd penned a manifesto which would prove to be the beginning of an aesthetic upheaval that would reach far beyond germany 's borders .
in a pamphlet he wrote for an april 1919 exhibition entitled " exhibition of unknown architects , " gropius described his goal as being " to create a new guild of craftsmen , without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist . "
he argued that a new era had begun with the end of the war , and he wanted a new architectural style to reflect this .
crucially , he advocated architecture and consumer goods that were functional , inexpensive and consistent with the industrialization and mass production that was changing the face of europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus buildings in dessau , shown here , and weimar are unesco world heritage sites the school existed in three german cities : weimar -lrb- 1919 -1925 -rrb- , dessau -lrb- 1925 - 1932 -rrb- and berlin -lrb- 1932 - 1933 -rrb- .
in 1933 , it was closed by the nazi regime .
during its years of operation , the school attracted avant garde artists such as wassily kandinsky , paul klee and lyonel feininger .
along with gropius , hannes meyer and ludwig mies van der rohe acted as architect-directors .
bauhaus spirit lives on but although the original bauhaus school had a relatively short lifespan , the bauhaus principles and aesthetic have lived on and served as the inspiration for more schools of design , particularly in the united states , where many of those associated with the bauhaus movement settled in the 1930s .
today , the bauhaus school is called the bauhaus university of weimar .
although weimar is commonly seen as the cradle of great german literary figures such as goethe and schiller , the popularity of bauhaus has also contributed to the city becoming a popular tourist destination in recent years .
many designers are taking the 90th anniversary as an occasion to bring remakes of bauhaus classics to the market .
at the interior design trade show ambiente in mid-february in frankfurt , a number of porcelain and glassmakers showed variations of designs that originated at the bauhaus school .
examples include tea sets by kpm in berlin and by rosenthal in selb .
gropius designed the tac collection in 1969 for rosenthal , which is offering the set in the bauhaus colors of blue , yellow and red to mark the anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamps in the bauhaus style a highlight of the bauhaus anniversary week celebrations in weimar will be the 11th international bauhaus colloquium featuring architectural experts from around the world debating the political and ethical challenges of globalization , and how architecture responds to them .
the bauhaus colloquia are highly-regarded conferences on architectural theory and have been held regularly since 1976 .
meanwhile , weimar is already looking ahead a decade to the bauhaus centenary , and plans to open a new museum dedicated to the movement in 2019 . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .
" the clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead , " de boer said .
all eyes on the us the united states ' position will be keenly observed in the coming days , since washington recently changed tack on climate change with the inauguration of president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us climate envoy todd stern former us president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , but it was never ratified .
the white house on saturday invited the un and 16 major economies to washington to prepare for international efforts to reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions .
" the us will be powerfully and fervently engaged in this process , " obama 's climate negotiator , todd stern said on sunday .
but he cautioned against unrealistic expectations that the united states could " wave a magic wand " and find solutions to all problems .
" i do n't think anybody should be thinking that the us can ride in on a white horse and make it all work , " he said .
the chinese puzzle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is a major greenhouse gas emitter in particular , washington wants to see china increase its commitment to emissions reduction , since the country 's economic growth made it one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors .
china and the us between them account for more than 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions .
" if you do the math , you simply can not be anywhere near where science tells us we need to be if you do n't have china involved , as well also other major developing countries , " he said .
the kyoto protocol was lenient on developing countries such as china , india and brazil .
this is to change in the document to be signed in copenhagen .
de boer welcomed obama 's initiative , saying it could be " useful " to find a political solution to the climate change talks . tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

marcell jansen , bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski got the other goals .
germany top group 4 with 13 points from five games ahead of russia , who have nine from four games .
only the group winner qualifies directly for the 2010 finals in south africa .
" we have fulfilled our duty , " said germany coach joachim loew .
" we had expected liechtenstein would defend with nine or ten men .
obviously , we would have liked to have scored a few more goals , but i am quite content . "
liechtenstein coach hans-peter zaugg admitted afterwards this was a good result for them and germany 's stars had expected more goals .
liechtenstein goalkeeper peter jehle said : " i am a little disappointed how we conceded the goals early in each half .
we made life too easy for the germans but in the end we played a decent match . "
loew had to make several changes due to injuries concerning among others striker miroslav klose , midfielder torsten frings and defender arne friedrich .
tsg hoffenheim defender andreas beck started for a first time and hanover 's robert enke returned between the posts from a hand fracture .
germany were determined from the start to make up for home defeats against england and norway in their last two -lrb- friendly -rrb- matches , with mario gomez heading wide just 16 seconds into the game .
chelsea midfielder ballack broke the deadlock in the fourth minute with a stunning volley high into the net off schweinsteiger 's cross .
just five minutes later sv hamburg 's jansen doubled the lead on the rebound from podolski 's shot saved which had been saved by jehle .
avalanche of goals fails to materialize the fans naturally hoped for plenty goals but the germans then showed a lack of precision until the break , and the second half passed in identical fashion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweini added a goal to give germany a 3-0 lead schweinsteiger made victory secure when he scored the third goal in the 48th when he hit the empty net after an initial shot from his bayern munich team-mate podolski , who then found the net himself two minutes later .
enke had to make only one save , in the 54th against mario frick , while up front most notably vfb stuttgart forward mario gomez failed to score as his germany drought now covers almost one year .
germany next visit wales , 2-0 losers against finland saturday , on wednesday .
the same day liechtenstein host russia .
" i am pleased with the victory , but now much harder tasks lie ahead for us , " said ballack whose side face russia next october in moscow in the game which is likely to decide the group .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 eu aims to present united front at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can 27 nations really march in one direction ?
after refining its economic positions at a recent summit , the eu seems ready to present a united front at the upcoming g20 talks in london .
but some issues are still being fought over within the 27-member bloc . at a summit in brussels on march 20 , the eu member states agreed on an extra 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , as well as a further 25 billion euros in emergency credit for eastern europe .
with that , the union appeared to have aligned the position it would take at the upcoming g20 summit in london on april 2 .
going by the words of french president nicolas sarkozy at the latest eu summit , it would seem that the european union is marching to london in step as one unit .
" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .
g8 ministers meet to discuss " human dimension " meanwhile in rome on sunday , labor ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- and six other major economies gathered for talks on the " human dimension " of the financial crisis sweeping the planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment is rising around the world due ´ to the crisis the three-day " group of 14 " meeting will bring together the g8 leading industrial powers with the emerging giants china , india and brazil as well as mexico , south africa and egypt at a time when worldwide job losses are sparking fears of social unrest .
the g14 " social summit " in rome will urge the g20 to put " people first " as they discuss economic recovery strategies and reforms to the financial regulatory system , italian labour minister maurizio sacconi said .
sacconi said the g14 would advocate a " global pact " to ensure sustainable social protections , investment in people , notably skills development , and job creation , especially in the areas of environmental protection , health and education .
imf chief dominique strauss-kahn warned last week that " dramatic " rises in unemployment around the world would set the stage for conflict .
social unrest fears gather credence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests , like this one in paris , have been peaceful so far the world financial crisis could spark " social unrest , some threats to democracy and maybe for some cases , it can also end in war , " he warned during an international labour organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- meeting in geneva .
the ilo in january said the global financial meltdown could claim up to 50 million jobs over 2008 and 2009 , while the world bank warned that the crisis could push 46 million back into poverty .
ilo chief juan somavia will stress in rome " that we are confronting an inter-connected financial , economic and social crisis , and that the attention of policy makers should turn to the three crises at the same time , " his deputy philippe egger said last week .
tens of thousands of people demonstrated in london , rome , berlin and other cities on saturday to express their anger at the human cost of the financial crisis .
organizers of the put people first march for " jobs , justice and climate " in london had rejected as " smears " claims in police briefings that marches could be hijacked by anarchists bent on violence .
france last week saw more than a million workers take to the streets in a nationwide strike to force president sarkozy to boost wages and protect jobs .

" the cooperative project lohafex has yielded new insights on how ocean ecosystems function , " the awi said in statement published earlier this week . " but it has dampened hopes on the potential of the southern ocean to sequester significant amounts of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- and thus mitigate global warming . " simple idea , complex issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polarstern is the most important tool in germany 's polar research program the team set sail from cape town on the polarstern vessel in january and spent two and half months conducting the geo-engineering experiment . the idea behind iron fertilization was simple .
algae living at the ocean surface have plenty of nutrients but are starved of iron .
sprinkle iron dust on the water and they reproduce rapidly , absorbing carbon dioxide from the surface water . at the end of their life cycle the algae die and sink .
most of the carbon would thus end up in deep water or on the sea bottom . the ocean would absorb more carbon dioxide from the air , reducing the greenhouse effect .
sequestering carbon this was thought to be a possible strategy against global warming . similar projects , however , have been heavily criticized by environmentalist groups for failing to address the human behavior that causes global warming and for having the potential to change the ecosystem in unforeseen ways . other geo-engineering ideas include sowing sulphur particles in the stratosphere to reflect solar radiation and erecting mirrors in orbit that would deflect sunrays and thus slightly cool the planet . sms / tt / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" experience has demonstrated that athletes who cheat seize every opportunity to do so and dope when they believe they wo n't be tested . "
fifa and uefa have taken issue with the rule implemented in january that requires elite athletes to indicate their whereabouts on a chosen one-hour period every day , seven days a week .
the soccer bodies have argued that this rule is too invasive , insisting that " the fundamental differences between an individual athlete , who trains on his own ... and a team-sport athlete , who is present at the stadium six days out of seven , and thus easy to locate , " must be taken into account .
they formally rejected the " whereabouts rule , " calling instead for " collective location rules , within the scope of the team . "
unfair policy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa and fifa : leave soccer stars , like david beckham , alone when they 're on vacation uefa chief michel platini and fifa president sepp blatter insist that the new rules are perceived as unfair by many sport associations .
" this is not just the line taken by soccer , but of all the team sports , basketball , handball , volleyball and rugby , " blatter said recently .
but the anti-doping agency said that it did in fact allow teams to submit the location of their players collectively and maintained that only fifa and uefa were disputing the rule .
" wada stakeholders have recognized this reality , and the feedback we have received from the overwhelming majority of other sports , but also from athletes and all those who support doping-free sport , strongly contradicts fifa 's and uefa 's stance , " fahey said .
blatter however put the focus on respecting player 's free time , saying that although the soccer federations are jointly combating doping , it should not turn into a " witch hunt . "
" i do n't want a fight , i just want them to understand , " blatter said .
platini echoed this sentiment of protecting players .

celebrations will include a special exhibition at the city 's bauhaus museum . bauhaus might be turning 90 , but for enthusiasts of the german design movement , the art , furniture and architecture it inspired still looks fresh and young .
the school was founded in 1919 by architect walter gropius , who wanted to create something bold and forward-thinking in the wake of world war i , which he described as a " catastrophe of world history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus classics designed by marcel breuer and ludwig mies van der rohe gropius was 35 when he applied to the city of weimar to establish an academy there .
by the time he received his permit , he 'd penned a manifesto which would prove to be the beginning of an aesthetic upheaval that would reach far beyond germany 's borders .
in a pamphlet he wrote for an april 1919 exhibition entitled " exhibition of unknown architects , " gropius described his goal as being " to create a new guild of craftsmen , without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist . "
he argued that a new era had begun with the end of the war , and he wanted a new architectural style to reflect this .
crucially , he advocated architecture and consumer goods that were functional , inexpensive and consistent with the industrialization and mass production that was changing the face of europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus buildings in dessau , shown here , and weimar are unesco world heritage sites the school existed in three german cities : weimar -lrb- 1919 -1925 -rrb- , dessau -lrb- 1925 - 1932 -rrb- and berlin -lrb- 1932 - 1933 -rrb- .
in 1933 , it was closed by the nazi regime .
during its years of operation , the school attracted avant garde artists such as wassily kandinsky , paul klee and lyonel feininger .
along with gropius , hannes meyer and ludwig mies van der rohe acted as architect-directors .
bauhaus spirit lives on but although the original bauhaus school had a relatively short lifespan , the bauhaus principles and aesthetic have lived on and served as the inspiration for more schools of design , particularly in the united states , where many of those associated with the bauhaus movement settled in the 1930s .
today , the bauhaus school is called the bauhaus university of weimar .
although weimar is commonly seen as the cradle of great german literary figures such as goethe and schiller , the popularity of bauhaus has also contributed to the city becoming a popular tourist destination in recent years .
many designers are taking the 90th anniversary as an occasion to bring remakes of bauhaus classics to the market .
at the interior design trade show ambiente in mid-february in frankfurt , a number of porcelain and glassmakers showed variations of designs that originated at the bauhaus school .
examples include tea sets by kpm in berlin and by rosenthal in selb .
gropius designed the tac collection in 1969 for rosenthal , which is offering the set in the bauhaus colors of blue , yellow and red to mark the anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamps in the bauhaus style a highlight of the bauhaus anniversary week celebrations in weimar will be the 11th international bauhaus colloquium featuring architectural experts from around the world debating the political and ethical challenges of globalization , and how architecture responds to them .
the bauhaus colloquia are highly-regarded conferences on architectural theory and have been held regularly since 1976 .
meanwhile , weimar is already looking ahead a decade to the bauhaus centenary , and plans to open a new museum dedicated to the movement in 2019 . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

celebrations will include a special exhibition at the city 's bauhaus museum . bauhaus might be turning 90 , but for enthusiasts of the german design movement , the art , furniture and architecture it inspired still looks fresh and young .
the school was founded in 1919 by architect walter gropius , who wanted to create something bold and forward-thinking in the wake of world war i , which he described as a " catastrophe of world history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus classics designed by marcel breuer and ludwig mies van der rohe gropius was 35 when he applied to the city of weimar to establish an academy there .
by the time he received his permit , he 'd penned a manifesto which would prove to be the beginning of an aesthetic upheaval that would reach far beyond germany 's borders .
in a pamphlet he wrote for an april 1919 exhibition entitled " exhibition of unknown architects , " gropius described his goal as being " to create a new guild of craftsmen , without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist . "
he argued that a new era had begun with the end of the war , and he wanted a new architectural style to reflect this .
crucially , he advocated architecture and consumer goods that were functional , inexpensive and consistent with the industrialization and mass production that was changing the face of europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus buildings in dessau , shown here , and weimar are unesco world heritage sites the school existed in three german cities : weimar -lrb- 1919 -1925 -rrb- , dessau -lrb- 1925 - 1932 -rrb- and berlin -lrb- 1932 - 1933 -rrb- .
in 1933 , it was closed by the nazi regime .
during its years of operation , the school attracted avant garde artists such as wassily kandinsky , paul klee and lyonel feininger .
along with gropius , hannes meyer and ludwig mies van der rohe acted as architect-directors .
bauhaus spirit lives on but although the original bauhaus school had a relatively short lifespan , the bauhaus principles and aesthetic have lived on and served as the inspiration for more schools of design , particularly in the united states , where many of those associated with the bauhaus movement settled in the 1930s .
today , the bauhaus school is called the bauhaus university of weimar .
although weimar is commonly seen as the cradle of great german literary figures such as goethe and schiller , the popularity of bauhaus has also contributed to the city becoming a popular tourist destination in recent years .
many designers are taking the 90th anniversary as an occasion to bring remakes of bauhaus classics to the market .
at the interior design trade show ambiente in mid-february in frankfurt , a number of porcelain and glassmakers showed variations of designs that originated at the bauhaus school .
examples include tea sets by kpm in berlin and by rosenthal in selb .
gropius designed the tac collection in 1969 for rosenthal , which is offering the set in the bauhaus colors of blue , yellow and red to mark the anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamps in the bauhaus style a highlight of the bauhaus anniversary week celebrations in weimar will be the 11th international bauhaus colloquium featuring architectural experts from around the world debating the political and ethical challenges of globalization , and how architecture responds to them .
the bauhaus colloquia are highly-regarded conferences on architectural theory and have been held regularly since 1976 .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 eu aims to present united front at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can 27 nations really march in one direction ?
after refining its economic positions at a recent summit , the eu seems ready to present a united front at the upcoming g20 talks in london .
but some issues are still being fought over within the 27-member bloc . at a summit in brussels on march 20 , the eu member states agreed on an extra 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , as well as a further 25 billion euros in emergency credit for eastern europe .
with that , the union appeared to have aligned the position it would take at the upcoming g20 summit in london on april 2 .
going by the words of french president nicolas sarkozy at the latest eu summit , it would seem that the european union is marching to london in step as one unit .
" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .

the g14 " social summit " in rome will urge the g20 to put " people first " as they discuss economic recovery strategies and reforms to the financial regulatory system , italian labour minister maurizio sacconi said .
sacconi said the g14 would advocate a " global pact " to ensure sustainable social protections , investment in people , notably skills development , and job creation , especially in the areas of environmental protection , health and education .
imf chief dominique strauss-kahn warned last week that " dramatic " rises in unemployment around the world would set the stage for conflict .

the ilo in january said the global financial meltdown could claim up to 50 million jobs over 2008 and 2009 , while the world bank warned that the crisis could push 46 million back into poverty .
ilo chief juan somavia will stress in rome " that we are confronting an inter-connected financial , economic and social crisis , and that the attention of policy makers should turn to the three crises at the same time , " his deputy philippe egger said last week .

the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .

germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 eu aims to present united front at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can 27 nations really march in one direction ?
after refining its economic positions at a recent summit , the eu seems ready to present a united front at the upcoming g20 talks in london .
but some issues are still being fought over within the 27-member bloc . at a summit in brussels on march 20 , the eu member states agreed on an extra 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , as well as a further 25 billion euros in emergency credit for eastern europe .
with that , the union appeared to have aligned the position it would take at the upcoming g20 summit in london on april 2 .
going by the words of french president nicolas sarkozy at the latest eu summit , it would seem that the european union is marching to london in step as one unit .
" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

after refining its economic positions at a recent summit , the eu seems ready to present a united front at the upcoming g20 talks in london .
but some issues are still being fought over within the 27-member bloc . at a summit in brussels on march 20 , the eu member states agreed on an extra 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , as well as a further 25 billion euros in emergency credit for eastern europe .
with that , the union appeared to have aligned the position it would take at the upcoming g20 summit in london on april 2 .
going by the words of french president nicolas sarkozy at the latest eu summit , it would seem that the european union is marching to london in step as one unit .
" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .
" the clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead , " de boer said .
all eyes on the us the united states ' position will be keenly observed in the coming days , since washington recently changed tack on climate change with the inauguration of president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us climate envoy todd stern former us president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , but it was never ratified .
the white house on saturday invited the un and 16 major economies to washington to prepare for international efforts to reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions .
" the us will be powerfully and fervently engaged in this process , " obama 's climate negotiator , todd stern said on sunday .
but he cautioned against unrealistic expectations that the united states could " wave a magic wand " and find solutions to all problems .
" i do n't think anybody should be thinking that the us can ride in on a white horse and make it all work , " he said .
the chinese puzzle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is a major greenhouse gas emitter in particular , washington wants to see china increase its commitment to emissions reduction , since the country 's economic growth made it one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors .
china and the us between them account for more than 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions .
" if you do the math , you simply can not be anywhere near where science tells us we need to be if you do n't have china involved , as well also other major developing countries , " he said .
the kyoto protocol was lenient on developing countries such as china , india and brazil .
this is to change in the document to be signed in copenhagen .
de boer welcomed obama 's initiative , saying it could be " useful " to find a political solution to the climate change talks . tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

marcell jansen , bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski got the other goals .
germany top group 4 with 13 points from five games ahead of russia , who have nine from four games .
only the group winner qualifies directly for the 2010 finals in south africa .
" we have fulfilled our duty , " said germany coach joachim loew .
" we had expected liechtenstein would defend with nine or ten men .
obviously , we would have liked to have scored a few more goals , but i am quite content . "
liechtenstein coach hans-peter zaugg admitted afterwards this was a good result for them and germany 's stars had expected more goals .
liechtenstein goalkeeper peter jehle said : " i am a little disappointed how we conceded the goals early in each half .
we made life too easy for the germans but in the end we played a decent match . "
loew had to make several changes due to injuries concerning among others striker miroslav klose , midfielder torsten frings and defender arne friedrich .
tsg hoffenheim defender andreas beck started for a first time and hanover 's robert enke returned between the posts from a hand fracture .
germany were determined from the start to make up for home defeats against england and norway in their last two -lrb- friendly -rrb- matches , with mario gomez heading wide just 16 seconds into the game .
chelsea midfielder ballack broke the deadlock in the fourth minute with a stunning volley high into the net off schweinsteiger 's cross .
just five minutes later sv hamburg 's jansen doubled the lead on the rebound from podolski 's shot saved which had been saved by jehle .
avalanche of goals fails to materialize the fans naturally hoped for plenty goals but the germans then showed a lack of precision until the break , and the second half passed in identical fashion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweini added a goal to give germany a 3-0 lead schweinsteiger made victory secure when he scored the third goal in the 48th when he hit the empty net after an initial shot from his bayern munich team-mate podolski , who then found the net himself two minutes later .
enke had to make only one save , in the 54th against mario frick , while up front most notably vfb stuttgart forward mario gomez failed to score as his germany drought now covers almost one year .
germany next visit wales , 2-0 losers against finland saturday , on wednesday .
the same day liechtenstein host russia .
" i am pleased with the victory , but now much harder tasks lie ahead for us , " said ballack whose side face russia next october in moscow in the game which is likely to decide the group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : g20 summit in london can europe help developing countries out of the crisis ?
germany and france make the case for regulation financial crisis hindering african development goals merkel , medvedev unite on market reform before g20 summit economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 eu aims to present united front at g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can 27 nations really march in one direction ?
after refining its economic positions at a recent summit , the eu seems ready to present a united front at the upcoming g20 talks in london .
but some issues are still being fought over within the 27-member bloc . at a summit in brussels on march 20 , the eu member states agreed on an extra 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , as well as a further 25 billion euros in emergency credit for eastern europe .
with that , the union appeared to have aligned the position it would take at the upcoming g20 summit in london on april 2 .
going by the words of french president nicolas sarkozy at the latest eu summit , it would seem that the european union is marching to london in step as one unit .
" everyone agrees on tax havens and a blacklist , on hedge funds and executive pay , on clear balancing rules for banks and the need for regulation , " sarkozy said .
bildunterschrift : everybody seems united , at least for the photo op but many of the details of these issues continue to be up for debate in the eu , and will have to be voted on in london together with the other participants .
the issue of tax havens is one such example .
with his call for greater cooperation to combat tax evasion , german finance minister peer steinbrueck prompted a hefty response not just in switzerland , but also in eu states such as luxembourg and austria .
the preliminary result of this internal european conflict is that no eu country should be put on the blacklist of uncooperative states .
crisis management when it comes to management of the economic crisis , the question of where the emphasis should lie is raised time and again : control of the financial markets , stimulation of demand , or saving jobs ?
according to eu commission president jose barroso , all these aspects have to be seen together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the crisis requires to be takcled on all fronts " you ca n't separate the financial markets from the economy and jobs , " he said .
" we ca n't pit economic issues against social questions , or prioritize social issues over economic ones .
we have to act on all fronts . "
the host of the g20 summit , british prime minister gordon brown , also sees a danger that many countries - european countries included - are reacting wrongly to the crisis .
" i know that the temptation for many is to meet this uncertainty by pulling back , but i 'm telling you that if we 've learned anything from history , it 's that protectionism is a policy of defeat and fear , and in the end , it protects no one , " brown said at an address at the european parliament .
no more stimulus packages willingness to compromise aside , there 's one important point in which the eu will likely not bend : more national economic stimulus packages , as washington is requesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not interested in any more stimulus packages many states are already swimming in debt , and even before the summit , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt warned of the consequences of more expenditure .
" the problem is that we 're reaching the point where europe has done what it can , and we 're also coming to the point where many european national economies have huge budget deficits , which will create new problems , " he said .
" interest rates and taxes have to be pushed upwards in order to balance these deficits . "
from the european perspective , one of the basic problems of the g20 summit is that only a minority of eu states are going to london , and they more or less have to represent the others .
the question is to what extent will the many small countries feel that they 've been represented by the few big ones .

" the cooperative project lohafex has yielded new insights on how ocean ecosystems function , " the awi said in statement published earlier this week .

algae living at the ocean surface have plenty of nutrients but are starved of iron .
sprinkle iron dust on the water and they reproduce rapidly , absorbing carbon dioxide from the surface water . at the end of their life cycle the algae die and sink .
most of the carbon would thus end up in deep water or on the sea bottom . the ocean would absorb more carbon dioxide from the air , reducing the greenhouse effect .
sequestering carbon this was thought to be a possible strategy against global warming . similar projects , however , have been heavily criticized by environmentalist groups for failing to address the human behavior that causes global warming and for having the potential to change the ecosystem in unforeseen ways . other geo-engineering ideas include sowing sulphur particles in the stratosphere to reflect solar radiation and erecting mirrors in orbit that would deflect sunrays and thus slightly cool the planet . sms / tt / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .
" the clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead , " de boer said .
all eyes on the us the united states ' position will be keenly observed in the coming days , since washington recently changed tack on climate change with the inauguration of president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us climate envoy todd stern former us president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , but it was never ratified .
the white house on saturday invited the un and 16 major economies to washington to prepare for international efforts to reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions .
" the us will be powerfully and fervently engaged in this process , " obama 's climate negotiator , todd stern said on sunday .
but he cautioned against unrealistic expectations that the united states could " wave a magic wand " and find solutions to all problems .
" i do n't think anybody should be thinking that the us can ride in on a white horse and make it all work , " he said .
the chinese puzzle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is a major greenhouse gas emitter in particular , washington wants to see china increase its commitment to emissions reduction , since the country 's economic growth made it one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors .
china and the us between them account for more than 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions .
" if you do the math , you simply can not be anywhere near where science tells us we need to be if you do n't have china involved , as well also other major developing countries , " he said .
the kyoto protocol was lenient on developing countries such as china , india and brazil .
this is to change in the document to be signed in copenhagen .
de boer welcomed obama 's initiative , saying it could be " useful " to find a political solution to the climate change talks . tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .
" the clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead , " de boer said .

" if you do the math , you simply can not be anywhere near where science tells us we need to be if you do n't have china involved , as well also other major developing countries , " he said .

some 371 landmarks powered down worldwide , including the eiffel tower , niagara falls , the las vegas casino strip and beijing 's " bird 's nest " olympic stadium .
the switch-off ended in honolulu , capital of the us state of hawaii .
residents of the chatham islands , a territory of new zealand in the southern pacific ocean , turned off light switches and kicked off the global earth hour .
one of the event 's dramatic episodes occurred in sydney , where the iconic opera house and harbour bridge plunged into darkness on saturday night , killing their lights for an hour .
millions of people turned out in sydney , while melbourne , australia 's second-largest city , came to life with a pedal-powered concert and others enjoyed moonlit picnics and barbecues .
the global grassroots movement began in sydney two years ago , when 2.2 million people switched off their lights .
earth hour has since grown to include 3,929 cities , villages and localities across the globe .
" it is a very positive , hopeful campaign , " andy ridley , the event 's director , told reporters in sydney .
" we want people to think , even if it is for an hour , what they can do to lower their carbon footprint and take that beyond the hour . "
organizers send message to world leaders ridley said he was aiming for one billion participants , hoping the event would send a resounding message to world leaders about significant emissions cuts .
scientists have warned that global warming caused by burning fossil fuels on a massive scale could devastate the planet , hitting the poorest countries hardest with floods , droughts and disease .
sceptics criticized the event as little more than empty symbolism , with danish professor bjorn lomborg claiming the use of candles during the hour could produce more emissions than electric lights .

some 371 landmarks powered down worldwide , including the eiffel tower , niagara falls , the las vegas casino strip and beijing 's " bird 's nest " olympic stadium .
the switch-off ended in honolulu , capital of the us state of hawaii .
residents of the chatham islands , a territory of new zealand in the southern pacific ocean , turned off light switches and kicked off the global earth hour .
one of the event 's dramatic episodes occurred in sydney , where the iconic opera house and harbour bridge plunged into darkness on saturday night , killing their lights for an hour .
millions of people turned out in sydney , while melbourne , australia 's second-largest city , came to life with a pedal-powered concert and others enjoyed moonlit picnics and barbecues .
the global grassroots movement began in sydney two years ago , when 2.2 million people switched off their lights .
earth hour has since grown to include 3,929 cities , villages and localities across the globe .
" it is a very positive , hopeful campaign , " andy ridley , the event 's director , told reporters in sydney .
" we want people to think , even if it is for an hour , what they can do to lower their carbon footprint and take that beyond the hour . "
organizers send message to world leaders ridley said he was aiming for one billion participants , hoping the event would send a resounding message to world leaders about significant emissions cuts .
scientists have warned that global warming caused by burning fossil fuels on a massive scale could devastate the planet , hitting the poorest countries hardest with floods , droughts and disease .
sceptics criticized the event as little more than empty symbolism , with danish professor bjorn lomborg claiming the use of candles during the hour could produce more emissions than electric lights .
but united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon said in a video message earlier this month that " earth hour is a way for the citizens of the world to send a clear message .
they want action on climate change . "
lights in the " city that never sleeps " began going dark at 8:30 pm -lrb- 0130 cet -rrb- at some of new york city 's most renowned buildings and landmarks , including broadway theaters , the empire state building , the chrysler building and the signs of several big firms , including coca-cola 's in times square .
in washington , campuses of major universities and several embassies flipped the switch .
people gathered at freedom plaza , which has an unobstructed view of the us congress , to watch the lights dim on nearby buildings and hotels .
iconic structures plunged into darkness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden gate bridge added its weight to the message in london , the lights went off at the houses of parliament and the famous electronic billboard at piccadilly circus .
in paris , hundreds of monuments and buildings , from the louvre and notre dame cathedral to the arc de triomphe , all went dark .
for safety reasons , the lights on the eiffel tower were switched off for only five minutes .
elsewhere across europe , st peter 's basilica in rome and the greek parliament in athens were all plunged into darkness , while entertainers danced in front of the romanian parliament in bucharest .
in egypt , the giza pyramids , the cairo tower and the alexandria library on the mediterranean all went dark .
in the united arab emirates , which has the highest per capita energy consumption in the world , dubai 's iconic sail-shaped seven-star burj al arab hotel turned off its nightly multi-colored light show .
the lights went dark in downtown manila , as they did in the world 's tallest completed skyscraper , the taipei 101 building .
in south africa , table mountain was to be seen only by starlight for an hour .
and the weekender newspaper reported that one couple would turn the lights down on their marriage at a vineyard near cape town .
the event ended in honolulu , where municipal buildings darkened for the second consecutive year to mark the eco-friendly hour , according to local news reports .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 29.03.2009 g20 leaders planning revamp of market regulations at london summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 hopes to bring world financial markets into line the world 's biggest economic powers are expected to agree next week on an urgent revamp of market regulations , helping them to smooth over a rift about the need for new public spending to combat the global recession . indeed , the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- landmark summit of the world 's richest and emerging economies in london is likely to sign off on plans to bring world financial controls into line with the changes unleashed by fast-paced globalization by stepping up coordinated market supervision and closing off gaps in the regulatory system .
the g20 agreement on overhauling the world financial structure will also help to paper over the differences between member states on the need for pumping more money into the world economy to help kick-start growth and thaw frozen credit markets .
but apart from driving forward the cause of market reform , firm commitments at the summit are likely to be limited to a significant increase in funding for the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which forms a key part of global financial architecture .
" nothing much is now expected beyond another exquisitely crafted statement that shows how much everyone is in agreement with each other about everything , " said ray attrill , economist with the research group 4cast .
while hopes have been raised that the economic downturn might bottom out in the coming months , the g20 summit is being held against the backdrop of evidence that the recession is starting to bite amid a stream of disastrous economic data and layoffs .
as a sign that the slump has gained momentum , thursday 's meeting will also coincide with the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- delivering another forecast 50 basis points rate cut .
the prospects of the ecb reducing borrowing costs again comes in the wake of reports showing japanese exports crashing by nearly 50 per cent in february , german business confidence at about 26-year low and the us economy shrinking by 6.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2008 .
what is more , the deepening economic gloom also means that the g20 summit in london 's vast new conference center on the river thames could be held against the backdrop of potentially violent demonstrations on the streets outside .
g20 looking to protect the poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 wants to shield the poor from the donwturn apart from overhauling the world financial system , the g20 leaders are again expected to call for steps to shield those in poverty from the full force of the downturn and to issue a stern warning about the threat posed by climate change and protectionism .
the summit is to be launched wednesday with a reception at buckingham palace followed by what has been billed as a recession-style meal to be prepared by british star chief jamie oliver at number 10 downing street , the g20 host and uk prime minister gordon brown 's residence .
but after a three-continent trip aimed at forging consensus ahead of the london 's summit , brown 's diplomatic could still face a major test at the meeting with positions appearing to have hardened in the run-up to the gathering .
us president barack obama can count on g20 members japan , korea , and australia as well as possibly china to support his push for the summit to take what he said was " bold , comprehensive and coordinated action " to jump start a recovery .
the imf has also called for additional economic stimulus plans .
but spearheaded by german chancellor angela merkel , europe remains skeptical about throwing more money at the recession , arguing that it will take some time for the measures also introduced to take effect and that the focus should now be on financial reform .
europe concerned about unsustainable growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for merkel it 's a question of too much not too little " this crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth , " merkel said in an interview with saturday 's financial times .
backing up the european stance the chiefs of europe 's two leading central banks , the european central bank and the bank of england , have also questioned boosting funds to deal with the recession .
representing about 85 per cent of world economic activity and formed in 1999 , the g20 includes the world 's top industrialized nations , such as canada and france as well leading emerging economies , such as china , india , brazil and saudi arabia .
but none of the government chiefs attending the london summit will want to see it fail in the midst of the world 's biggest financial crisis since the great depression .
least of all obama , who will be keen to ensure his first major foray onto the world stage , does not end on a sour note .
obama unlikely to make demands in london obama is not expected to make demands for new economic stimulus program by the other members of the g20 top , although it maintains significant stimulus remains critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is unwilling to rock the boat on his first big engagement " nobody has asked and nobody is asking any country to come to london to commit to do more right now , " mike froman , the white house deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs , said .
washington has indicated in recent weeks that it wants european governments to follow the us by spending billions more in economic stimulus , a move most of obama 's counterparts , particularly merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , have flatly rejected .
but briefing reporters saturday ahead of obama 's trip , spokesman robert gibbs appeared to play down any differences among the leaders .
" the president and america are going to listen in london , as well as to lead , " gibbs said .
white house officials insisted there was a broad consensus on action to restore the economic amid the global recession .
so instead of new concrete budget measures to help haul global economy out of its current downturn , the leaders are likely to take their cue from their finance ministers ' meeting this month and simple declare they will do what ever is necessary to fight the recession .
g8 ministers meet to discuss " human dimension " meanwhile in rome on sunday , labor ministers from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- and six other major economies gathered for talks on the " human dimension " of the financial crisis sweeping the planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment is rising around the world due ´ to the crisis the three-day " group of 14 " meeting will bring together the g8 leading industrial powers with the emerging giants china , india and brazil as well as mexico , south africa and egypt at a time when worldwide job losses are sparking fears of social unrest .
the g14 " social summit " in rome will urge the g20 to put " people first " as they discuss economic recovery strategies and reforms to the financial regulatory system , italian labour minister maurizio sacconi said .
sacconi said the g14 would advocate a " global pact " to ensure sustainable social protections , investment in people , notably skills development , and job creation , especially in the areas of environmental protection , health and education .
imf chief dominique strauss-kahn warned last week that " dramatic " rises in unemployment around the world would set the stage for conflict .
social unrest fears gather credence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests , like this one in paris , have been peaceful so far the world financial crisis could spark " social unrest , some threats to democracy and maybe for some cases , it can also end in war , " he warned during an international labour organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- meeting in geneva .
the ilo in january said the global financial meltdown could claim up to 50 million jobs over 2008 and 2009 , while the world bank warned that the crisis could push 46 million back into poverty .
ilo chief juan somavia will stress in rome " that we are confronting an inter-connected financial , economic and social crisis , and that the attention of policy makers should turn to the three crises at the same time , " his deputy philippe egger said last week .
tens of thousands of people demonstrated in london , rome , berlin and other cities on saturday to express their anger at the human cost of the financial crisis .
organizers of the put people first march for " jobs , justice and climate " in london had rejected as " smears " claims in police briefings that marches could be hijacked by anarchists bent on violence .
france last week saw more than a million workers take to the streets in a nationwide strike to force president sarkozy to boost wages and protect jobs .
a protest in paris left nine police officers injured and led to some 300 arrests . nda / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the long term however , the german government bank bailout agency soffin is to take complete control of the bank , hre said .
soffin is to purchase 20 million shares at a price of three euros each , granting a 60-million-euro -lrb- $ 80.1-million -rrb- capital injection to hre .
the current shareholders will initially remain on board .
" -lrb- soffin -rrb- intends to take action to stabilize hypo real estate group , in the interest of stabilizing the financial markets , " soffin said .
" soffin will implement measures to achieve a sufficient recapitalization " of hre , the statement added .
however , the prerequisite for soffin to stabilize the ailing bank is said to be a complete state takeover , either through the bailout fund or by direct government intervention .
" to this end it is intended to make use of the options that will be provided by the german financial markets stabilization amendment act , which is currently being discussed in the legislative process , " a statement on the bank 's website said .

the head of hre said sunday the state 's purchase of the 8.7 percent stake in the bank would allow it to survive despite expected losses for the next two years .
chief executive axel wieandt hailed the government 's purchase of 20 million shares as " good news . "
" with the proposed long-term liquidity and capital support , the federal republic ... has put in place the necessary requirements for hre to continue , " wieandt said in a statement .

it is in everyone 's interests , " the chief executive stressed .
however , he acknowledged that the bank expected to be " in a loss situation for at least the next two years . "

" this result very much reflects the difficult situation on the capital and financing markets , " the bank said in the earnings statement .
the pre-tax loss was 5.375 billion , it said , compared to pre-tax profits of 862 million euros in 2007 .
it said hre expected to make losses until at least 2011 .
" the financial year 2008 reflects the impact of the general crisis on the international financial markets and the specific extremely difficult situation for the hypo real estate group , " wieandt , said in a statement .
hre said in its earnings statement that complex " derivative " investments with lehman brothers had been the main cause of a 150-million-euro expense on its own balance sheet .
it said it was also hit by losses linked to icelandic banks , which were largely wiped out by the financial crisis last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 29.03.2009 german government to buy stake in ailing lender hre großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre is being saved from potentially catastrophic bankruptcy the german federal government is to buy shares of ailing mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , the bank announced saturday , in a move which would keep the ailing lender afloat for at least two more years . the state is to initially recapitalize the munich-based financier by purchasing an 8.7-per-cent stake in the business , hre said in a statement .
in the long term however , the german government bank bailout agency soffin is to take complete control of the bank , hre said .
soffin is to purchase 20 million shares at a price of three euros each , granting a 60-million-euro -lrb- $ 80.1-million -rrb- capital injection to hre .
the current shareholders will initially remain on board .
" -lrb- soffin -rrb- intends to take action to stabilize hypo real estate group , in the interest of stabilizing the financial markets , " soffin said .
" soffin will implement measures to achieve a sufficient recapitalization " of hre , the statement added .
however , the prerequisite for soffin to stabilize the ailing bank is said to be a complete state takeover , either through the bailout fund or by direct government intervention .
" to this end it is intended to make use of the options that will be provided by the german financial markets stabilization amendment act , which is currently being discussed in the legislative process , " a statement on the bank 's website said .
the act , which specifies the conditions for a state expropriation of hre , has been approved by germany 's lower house of parliament .
state ministers are expected to grant their approval in an upper house consultation due friday .
berlin moves to avert catastrophic bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doomed lehman brothers could have brought down hre berlin is concerned that the failure of hre could have catastrophic consequences similar to those sparked by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september , which hit financial markets around the world .
the head of hre said sunday the state 's purchase of the 8.7 percent stake in the bank would allow it to survive despite expected losses for the next two years .
chief executive axel wieandt hailed the government 's purchase of 20 million shares as " good news . "
" with the proposed long-term liquidity and capital support , the federal republic ... has put in place the necessary requirements for hre to continue , " wieandt said in a statement .
" we welcome this step .
it is in the interests of the company and clearly good news , " he added .
the purchase of hre shares - at the minimum legal price of three euros per share - is an " important signal , an important first step , " he said .
" the stabilization and rescue of hre must succeed .
it is in everyone 's interests , " the chief executive stressed .
however , he acknowledged that the bank expected to be " in a loss situation for at least the next two years . "
" nevertheless , we see our medium-term strategic prospects as positive , " he said .
hre announces hefty losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre 's wieandt was understandably pleased hre also released its unaudited earnings statement for 2008 , reporting a hefty net loss of 5.46 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.25 billion -rrb- due largely to write-downs on intangible assets .
" this result very much reflects the difficult situation on the capital and financing markets , " the bank said in the earnings statement .
the pre-tax loss was 5.375 billion , it said , compared to pre-tax profits of 862 million euros in 2007 .
it said hre expected to make losses until at least 2011 .
" the financial year 2008 reflects the impact of the general crisis on the international financial markets and the specific extremely difficult situation for the hypo real estate group , " wieandt , said in a statement .
hre said in its earnings statement that complex " derivative " investments with lehman brothers had been the main cause of a 150-million-euro expense on its own balance sheet .
it said it was also hit by losses linked to icelandic banks , which were largely wiped out by the financial crisis last year .
hre has already benefited from more than 100 billion euros in private and public aid to keep it afloat . nda / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 29.03.2009 celebrations mark 90 years of bauhaus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus masters in a group photo bauhaus , the modern design movement that originated in the eastern german city of weimar , marks its 90th birthday on april 1 .
celebrations will include a special exhibition at the city 's bauhaus museum . bauhaus might be turning 90 , but for enthusiasts of the german design movement , the art , furniture and architecture it inspired still looks fresh and young .
the school was founded in 1919 by architect walter gropius , who wanted to create something bold and forward-thinking in the wake of world war i , which he described as a " catastrophe of world history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus classics designed by marcel breuer and ludwig mies van der rohe gropius was 35 when he applied to the city of weimar to establish an academy there .
by the time he received his permit , he 'd penned a manifesto which would prove to be the beginning of an aesthetic upheaval that would reach far beyond germany 's borders .
in a pamphlet he wrote for an april 1919 exhibition entitled " exhibition of unknown architects , " gropius described his goal as being " to create a new guild of craftsmen , without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist . "
he argued that a new era had begun with the end of the war , and he wanted a new architectural style to reflect this .
crucially , he advocated architecture and consumer goods that were functional , inexpensive and consistent with the industrialization and mass production that was changing the face of europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus buildings in dessau , shown here , and weimar are unesco world heritage sites the school existed in three german cities : weimar -lrb- 1919 -1925 -rrb- , dessau -lrb- 1925 - 1932 -rrb- and berlin -lrb- 1932 - 1933 -rrb- .
in 1933 , it was closed by the nazi regime .
during its years of operation , the school attracted avant garde artists such as wassily kandinsky , paul klee and lyonel feininger .
along with gropius , hannes meyer and ludwig mies van der rohe acted as architect-directors .
bauhaus spirit lives on but although the original bauhaus school had a relatively short lifespan , the bauhaus principles and aesthetic have lived on and served as the inspiration for more schools of design , particularly in the united states , where many of those associated with the bauhaus movement settled in the 1930s .
today , the bauhaus school is called the bauhaus university of weimar .
although weimar is commonly seen as the cradle of great german literary figures such as goethe and schiller , the popularity of bauhaus has also contributed to the city becoming a popular tourist destination in recent years .
many designers are taking the 90th anniversary as an occasion to bring remakes of bauhaus classics to the market .
at the interior design trade show ambiente in mid-february in frankfurt , a number of porcelain and glassmakers showed variations of designs that originated at the bauhaus school .
examples include tea sets by kpm in berlin and by rosenthal in selb .
gropius designed the tac collection in 1969 for rosenthal , which is offering the set in the bauhaus colors of blue , yellow and red to mark the anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamps in the bauhaus style a highlight of the bauhaus anniversary week celebrations in weimar will be the 11th international bauhaus colloquium featuring architectural experts from around the world debating the political and ethical challenges of globalization , and how architecture responds to them .
the bauhaus colloquia are highly-regarded conferences on architectural theory and have been held regularly since 1976 .

celebrations will include a special exhibition at the city 's bauhaus museum . bauhaus might be turning 90 , but for enthusiasts of the german design movement , the art , furniture and architecture it inspired still looks fresh and young .
the school was founded in 1919 by architect walter gropius , who wanted to create something bold and forward-thinking in the wake of world war i , which he described as a " catastrophe of world history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus classics designed by marcel breuer and ludwig mies van der rohe gropius was 35 when he applied to the city of weimar to establish an academy there .
by the time he received his permit , he 'd penned a manifesto which would prove to be the beginning of an aesthetic upheaval that would reach far beyond germany 's borders .
in a pamphlet he wrote for an april 1919 exhibition entitled " exhibition of unknown architects , " gropius described his goal as being " to create a new guild of craftsmen , without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist . "
he argued that a new era had begun with the end of the war , and he wanted a new architectural style to reflect this .
crucially , he advocated architecture and consumer goods that were functional , inexpensive and consistent with the industrialization and mass production that was changing the face of europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus buildings in dessau , shown here , and weimar are unesco world heritage sites the school existed in three german cities : weimar -lrb- 1919 -1925 -rrb- , dessau -lrb- 1925 - 1932 -rrb- and berlin -lrb- 1932 - 1933 -rrb- .
in 1933 , it was closed by the nazi regime .
during its years of operation , the school attracted avant garde artists such as wassily kandinsky , paul klee and lyonel feininger .
along with gropius , hannes meyer and ludwig mies van der rohe acted as architect-directors .
bauhaus spirit lives on but although the original bauhaus school had a relatively short lifespan , the bauhaus principles and aesthetic have lived on and served as the inspiration for more schools of design , particularly in the united states , where many of those associated with the bauhaus movement settled in the 1930s .
today , the bauhaus school is called the bauhaus university of weimar .
although weimar is commonly seen as the cradle of great german literary figures such as goethe and schiller , the popularity of bauhaus has also contributed to the city becoming a popular tourist destination in recent years .
many designers are taking the 90th anniversary as an occasion to bring remakes of bauhaus classics to the market .
at the interior design trade show ambiente in mid-february in frankfurt , a number of porcelain and glassmakers showed variations of designs that originated at the bauhaus school .
examples include tea sets by kpm in berlin and by rosenthal in selb .
gropius designed the tac collection in 1969 for rosenthal , which is offering the set in the bauhaus colors of blue , yellow and red to mark the anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamps in the bauhaus style a highlight of the bauhaus anniversary week celebrations in weimar will be the 11th international bauhaus colloquium featuring architectural experts from around the world debating the political and ethical challenges of globalization , and how architecture responds to them .
the bauhaus colloquia are highly-regarded conferences on architectural theory and have been held regularly since 1976 .

celebrations will include a special exhibition at the city 's bauhaus museum . bauhaus might be turning 90 , but for enthusiasts of the german design movement , the art , furniture and architecture it inspired still looks fresh and young .
the school was founded in 1919 by architect walter gropius , who wanted to create something bold and forward-thinking in the wake of world war i , which he described as a " catastrophe of world history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus classics designed by marcel breuer and ludwig mies van der rohe gropius was 35 when he applied to the city of weimar to establish an academy there .
by the time he received his permit , he 'd penned a manifesto which would prove to be the beginning of an aesthetic upheaval that would reach far beyond germany 's borders .
in a pamphlet he wrote for an april 1919 exhibition entitled " exhibition of unknown architects , " gropius described his goal as being " to create a new guild of craftsmen , without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist . "
he argued that a new era had begun with the end of the war , and he wanted a new architectural style to reflect this .
crucially , he advocated architecture and consumer goods that were functional , inexpensive and consistent with the industrialization and mass production that was changing the face of europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bauhaus buildings in dessau , shown here , and weimar are unesco world heritage sites the school existed in three german cities : weimar -lrb- 1919 -1925 -rrb- , dessau -lrb- 1925 - 1932 -rrb- and berlin -lrb- 1932 - 1933 -rrb- .
in 1933 , it was closed by the nazi regime .
during its years of operation , the school attracted avant garde artists such as wassily kandinsky , paul klee and lyonel feininger .
along with gropius , hannes meyer and ludwig mies van der rohe acted as architect-directors .
bauhaus spirit lives on but although the original bauhaus school had a relatively short lifespan , the bauhaus principles and aesthetic have lived on and served as the inspiration for more schools of design , particularly in the united states , where many of those associated with the bauhaus movement settled in the 1930s .
today , the bauhaus school is called the bauhaus university of weimar .
although weimar is commonly seen as the cradle of great german literary figures such as goethe and schiller , the popularity of bauhaus has also contributed to the city becoming a popular tourist destination in recent years .
many designers are taking the 90th anniversary as an occasion to bring remakes of bauhaus classics to the market .
at the interior design trade show ambiente in mid-february in frankfurt , a number of porcelain and glassmakers showed variations of designs that originated at the bauhaus school .
examples include tea sets by kpm in berlin and by rosenthal in selb .
gropius designed the tac collection in 1969 for rosenthal , which is offering the set in the bauhaus colors of blue , yellow and red to mark the anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamps in the bauhaus style a highlight of the bauhaus anniversary week celebrations in weimar will be the 11th international bauhaus colloquium featuring architectural experts from around the world debating the political and ethical challenges of globalization , and how architecture responds to them .
the bauhaus colloquia are highly-regarded conferences on architectural theory and have been held regularly since 1976 .
meanwhile , weimar is already looking ahead a decade to the bauhaus centenary , and plans to open a new museum dedicated to the movement in 2019 . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the kyoto protocol , an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases , entered into force in 2005 .
yvo de boer , who heads climate change initiatives at the united nations , said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases .
additionally , those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries .
a challenge for big polluters the new agreement to replace the kyoto protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations , with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 figures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in order to slow global warming by the year 2050 , output is to be reduced even more , with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent .
that cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- .
these targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to december 's copenhagen summit .
many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible , perhaps by using compensatory projects , such as rain forest preservation , to help them meet targets .
de boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day bonn conference , as a draft proposal was needed by june in order to meet the copenhagen deadline .
" the clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead , " de boer said .
all eyes on the us the united states ' position will be keenly observed in the coming days , since washington recently changed tack on climate change with the inauguration of president barack obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us climate envoy todd stern former us president bill clinton signed the kyoto protocol , but it was never ratified .
the white house on saturday invited the un and 16 major economies to washington to prepare for international efforts to reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions .
" the us will be powerfully and fervently engaged in this process , " obama 's climate negotiator , todd stern said on sunday .
but he cautioned against unrealistic expectations that the united states could " wave a magic wand " and find solutions to all problems .
" i do n't think anybody should be thinking that the us can ride in on a white horse and make it all work , " he said .
the chinese puzzle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is a major greenhouse gas emitter in particular , washington wants to see china increase its commitment to emissions reduction , since the country 's economic growth made it one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors .
china and the us between them account for more than 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions .
" if you do the math , you simply can not be anywhere near where science tells us we need to be if you do n't have china involved , as well also other major developing countries , " he said .
the kyoto protocol was lenient on developing countries such as china , india and brazil .
this is to change in the document to be signed in copenhagen .

marcell jansen , bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski got the other goals .
germany top group 4 with 13 points from five games ahead of russia , who have nine from four games .
only the group winner qualifies directly for the 2010 finals in south africa .
" we have fulfilled our duty , " said germany coach joachim loew .
" we had expected liechtenstein would defend with nine or ten men .
obviously , we would have liked to have scored a few more goals , but i am quite content . "
liechtenstein coach hans-peter zaugg admitted afterwards this was a good result for them and germany 's stars had expected more goals .
liechtenstein goalkeeper peter jehle said : " i am a little disappointed how we conceded the goals early in each half .
we made life too easy for the germans but in the end we played a decent match . "
loew had to make several changes due to injuries concerning among others striker miroslav klose , midfielder torsten frings and defender arne friedrich .
tsg hoffenheim defender andreas beck started for a first time and hanover 's robert enke returned between the posts from a hand fracture .
germany were determined from the start to make up for home defeats against england and norway in their last two -lrb- friendly -rrb- matches , with mario gomez heading wide just 16 seconds into the game .
chelsea midfielder ballack broke the deadlock in the fourth minute with a stunning volley high into the net off schweinsteiger 's cross .
just five minutes later sv hamburg 's jansen doubled the lead on the rebound from podolski 's shot saved which had been saved by jehle .
avalanche of goals fails to materialize the fans naturally hoped for plenty goals but the germans then showed a lack of precision until the break , and the second half passed in identical fashion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweini added a goal to give germany a 3-0 lead schweinsteiger made victory secure when he scored the third goal in the 48th when he hit the empty net after an initial shot from his bayern munich team-mate podolski , who then found the net himself two minutes later .
enke had to make only one save , in the 54th against mario frick , while up front most notably vfb stuttgart forward mario gomez failed to score as his germany drought now covers almost one year .
germany next visit wales , 2-0 losers against finland saturday , on wednesday .
the same day liechtenstein host russia .
" i am pleased with the victory , but now much harder tasks lie ahead for us , " said ballack whose side face russia next october in moscow in the game which is likely to decide the group .

human rights lawyers brought the case against the six , who all served under former president george w bush .
among those named was former defence official douglas feith , who said the charges against him " made no sense " .
spanish courts can prosecute offences such as torture or war crimes even if they occurred in other countries .
the former officials - who include ex-attorney-general alberto gonzalez - could face arrest on leaving the us if the courts decide to issue warrants .
' controversial position ' the lawyers who brought the case accuse the six of providing legal cover to allow the security services to use techniques of interrogation such as " waterboarding " .
they say the methods amounted to torture .
mr feith , a former under-secretary for defence , rebuffed the accusations .
" the charges as related to me make no sense , " he said .
" they criticise me for promoting a controversial position that i never advocated . "
the lawyers took their accusations to judge baltasar garzon , who agreed to allow state prosecutors to decide if the case has merit .
judge garzon was responsible for bringing a prosecution against former chilean leader augusto pinochet , who was arrested in the uk in 1998 .
spain 's courts have also launched investigations over alleged crimes in argentina , tibet , el salvador and rwanda .

please note ' the andrew marr show ' must be credited if any part of this transcript is used .
the foreign secretary says reforming the world 's financial system is the priority for the summit .
andrew marr : well we 've been hearing this morning about chinese-british relationships , about chinese-russian-british relationships , and of course this week in london we 're going to have i think one of the biggest gatherings of world leaders ever seen for this g20 summit .
david miliband mp so there is a great deal to talk about with the foreign secretary david miliband who is with me now .
welcome , foreign secretary .
david miliband : good morning , andrew .
good to be here .
andrew marr : the g20 agenda .
from what kevin rudd was saying and what 's been said in the papers as well , there is n't going to be a new announcement on the fiscal stimulus side and so i 'm still struggling to grasp what is going to be the sort of rabbit-out-of-a-hat as it were in the final communique .
are we going to see something genuinely fresh on the architecture of the world 's finances , for instance ?
david miliband : i think that what is in play at the moment - and it 's significant that discussions are still going on - is first of all real discussion about financial sector reform because , remember , the origins of this crisis are in the financial sector .
andrew marr : yes .
david miliband : secondly in respect of macroeconomic coordination and the commitments of the finance ministers and how they 're taken forward .
third in respect of trade where words matter but so do systems for ensuring that open trade is protected and , if possible , advanced .
fourth , and significantly , 70 % of the world 's economic growth in the last 10 years has come from emerging and developing countries .
they are represented at the g20 .
it 's significant that the whole world is effectively around the table , not just the rich parts of the world .
so for the developing world , there are issues in play , and there 's also the low carbon aspect .
i think that is the agenda .
and it 's not about rabbits out of hats .
this is about trying to tackle an exceptional economic crisis , far beyond the financial system , and set in place measures , measures , that really do make a difference over the short-term and the medium-term .
andrew marr : so we will , we will actually see a series of specific , concrete proposals ?
david miliband : that 's certainly the andrew marr : it wo n't be general declarations ?
david miliband : no , this is not just warm words .
this is about there 's an article in the newspapers today saying 2 trillion dollars is never going to be achieved .
it actually already has been achieved !
that was actually a previous draft of the declaration .
and so substantial measures have been taken .
but it is a unique process because the truth about this is that the world 's been fundamentally unbalanced over the last 10 or 20 years - unbalanced economically between rich and poor , unbalanced environmentally , but also unbalanced politically because we 've got a global economic system but essentially national political systems .
what you see in the g20 is economic governance , issues of politics at the international level being applied to the economy really for the first time in 50 or 60 years .
and i think that is what makes this significant - not least because there 's real issues and real substance at stake .
andrew marr : but to be absolutely clear , what we 're not going to see is another huge tranche of money around the world freshly announced .
david miliband : well this debate and this g20 summit was never about writing national budgets .
it is about the international financial architecture .
the european union has pledged $ 100 billion .
so has japan .
so there will be figures in respect of the role of the imf , in respect of helping developing countries , but it 's not about writing andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- but in terms of new you know you were talking past tense then , and i understand that , but we 're not going to see another sort of global cheque being waved at the end of this .
david miliband : well there are global cheques with respect to the imf and the world bank .
andrew marr : right , okay .
david miliband : there are not cheques to do with the british budget , which is set in april , or the german budgets , etcetera .
so this is not about substituting .
andrew marr : so when angela merkel says you know we 're not going to be spending it , we 're not going to have another fiscal boost , you know it 's wrong , let 's see how this one works - in essence we 've accepted that argument ?
david miliband : we were never trying to substitute our decisions for the german budgetary process .
the germans andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- i think she was talking about the world , not david miliband : -lrb- over -rrb- remember when i came on this programme last year , you were saying look the germans are never going to do a fiscal stimulus , they do n't agree with you .
in fact two massive budget stimuluses have been put through in germany .
4 % of german gdp , a german fiscal stimulus actually bigger than ours .
so let 's not hear this ; that somehow the anglo saxons are for fiscal policy and the other europeans are for somehow regulation .
you 've got to do both .
you 've got to mend the banking system , but you 've also got to make sure that demand is put back into the economy .
andrew marr : i went through quite a lot of the issues between russia and britain with president medvedev .
what did you make of what he was saying and the tone that was coming back ?
david miliband : well i think it 's significant and important .
gordon brown reached out to president medvedev last july at the g8 summit .
he made a particular point of saying that the russian election could be a new beginning .
and i think we 've never sought to disguise the fact that there are bilateral issues that divide us , but at the multilateral level on iran , where there were significant statements today in your interview , on climate change , on nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament , we have big issues that we need to engage with , grapple with with russia .
the russian president , the russian foreign minister are coming this week and as leaders of the security council , we 're both permanent members of the security council , we have important responsibilities where we need to work with russia .
we 've always said it should be hard-headed engagement , and i think that 's what we 're getting back from the russians .
andrew marr : and in hard-headed terms on some of those specifics , do you now accept that we 're not going to get anywhere with the lugovoy-litvinenko issue ; that he is not going to be sent for trial in a third jurisdiction ?
david miliband : well i do n't think we can abandon our own independent judicial systems .
our judicial system has set in play a prosecution case .
we 've made requests to the russians .
it 's not for me to interfere in that and abandon that .
we 've had a terrible murder on british streets and it 's right that we pursue that .
equally , on the multilateral agenda we say we 've got business with the russians and , as president medvedev said , there 's also a trading link .
so we can compartmentalise those , i think .
andrew marr : and what about the british council ?
do you think relations are beginning to normalise ?
david miliband : well andrew marr : have you talked about restriction still ?
david miliband : yeah , the british council is now only operating in moscow .
andrew marr : moscow .
david miliband : the biggest losers are actually russians .
one and a quarter million russians used the british council last year .
this year , only about 500/700,000 will be able to because of the restrictions on their activity .
that 's a russian loss and i hope that they recognise that the purpose of the british council is actually to foster understanding between countries .
it 's not to pump out the line of the british government .
so i think that it is very , very important that we engage with countries like russia without fear or favour , but absolutely clear that they are as much part of this new global society as we are .
andrew marr : now we heard , we heard president medvedev talking about obama .
he and the russian president have n't met obama before , so there 's going to be a sort of kind of speed dating , diplomatic speed dating going on in london at the moment .
-lrb- miliband laughs -rrb- do you think this is a moment for a change in the tone of relations between the west and russia and also china ?
david miliband : well i do n't think it 's more than tone .
what joe biden , the us vice president said , is that he wanted to set the reset button on the us-russia relationship , and he has shown , whether on issues of nuclear proliferation or other issues , that they want to work with the russians very , very closely .
and that must be a good thing because russia has big equities in the international system .
it 's got a big role to play if it chooses to play it .
and , as i say , i think the prime minister was ahead of the curve on this last year and i think it 's right that this has followed through .
andrew marr : when it comes to running through many of the issues in front of you at the moment , when it comes to the change of policy in afghanistan announced by president obama , are we going to see another announcement of british troops to complement that ?
david miliband : well we 've not been asked by the us or by anyone else to increase our number of troops .
we have about between , around 12 % of all foreign troops in afghanistan .
the biggest increase in troops in afghanistan over the next few years is going to come from recruits of the afghan national army .
we are not in afghanistan to create a new colony .
andrew marr : so we should n't expect another boost from david miliband : -lrb- over -rrb- we always keep our troop numbers under review because we have to do so for the safety of our own troops and for our contribution to the coalition , but we have n't been asked for more troops .
what we have now is a new strategy from the us .
it 's a pakistan as well as an afghan strategy .
that 's a good thing .
it 's civilian as well as military .
that 's also a very , very good thing .
and at its heart is building the capacity of the afghan government and the pakistani government to sustain their own societies .
that 's also essential .
andrew marr : turning to domestic politics for a moment , the home secretary in trouble again over her expenses .
other ministers in trouble .
first of all , is her position any longer sustainable ?
and , second , for how long are we going to be picking up newspapers again and again with mp 's pushing absolutely to the edges and beyond what they can claim for expenses ?
this is bad for politics .
david miliband : jacqui smith is doing an outstanding job as home secretary .
i 'm not going to make any comment about individual allegations in respect of mp 's expenses .
what i know is that the system has to be much , much clearer than it was in the past .
that 's the purpose of the reforms that are being put into place .
the system has to be clear above all in the interests of the public , so that they can have trust and confidence in what i know , which is that mp 's come to westminster on all sides of the political spectrum andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- this looks a bit like final straw time for her , does n't it ?
david miliband : well i am never going to get into individual cases .
andrew marr : okay .
david miliband : what i 'm absolutely confident of is that jacqui smith is doing an outstanding job as the home secretary with some of the toughest responsibilities in government .
and i think that what counts in respect of the mp system is that the system is clear .
andrew marr : alright .
one final question .
one of the papers , i think it 's the independent on sunday , raised today the prospect of a new global summit coming up specifically on climate change and greening the world 's economy because that is the other vast issue in front of every world leader .
is that going to happen ?
is that a true report ?
david miliband : yes , it 's already been fixed .
look , one of the remarkable andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- so could you just explain about that ?
david miliband : yeah , one of the remarkable things that our prime minister has achieved since the washington summit is to broaden the agenda , so that it 's not just about finance .
it 's about the economy and about low carbon andrew marr : okay .
this specific summit ?
david miliband : and the green summit will be in december .
it 's the copenhagen summit .
it will design a replacement for the kyoto protocol .
andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- it 's the same copenhagen summit ?
there 's not a new summit of working this out ?
okay .
david miliband : -lrb- over -rrb- well i have n't read the newspaper report , but andrew marr : alright , i just wanted to be clear about that .
david miliband : the world has the responsibility this year to sort out the climate issue .
andrew marr : foreign secretary , thank you very much indeed for joining us .

please note ' the andrew marr show ' must be credited if any part of this transcript is used .
the foreign secretary says reforming the world 's financial system is the priority for the summit .
andrew marr : well we 've been hearing this morning about chinese-british relationships , about chinese-russian-british relationships , and of course this week in london we 're going to have i think one of the biggest gatherings of world leaders ever seen for this g20 summit .
david miliband mp so there is a great deal to talk about with the foreign secretary david miliband who is with me now .
welcome , foreign secretary .
david miliband : good morning , andrew .
good to be here .
andrew marr : the g20 agenda .
from what kevin rudd was saying and what 's been said in the papers as well , there is n't going to be a new announcement on the fiscal stimulus side and so i 'm still struggling to grasp what is going to be the sort of rabbit-out-of-a-hat as it were in the final communique .
are we going to see something genuinely fresh on the architecture of the world 's finances , for instance ?
david miliband : i think that what is in play at the moment - and it 's significant that discussions are still going on - is first of all real discussion about financial sector reform because , remember , the origins of this crisis are in the financial sector .
andrew marr : yes .
david miliband : secondly in respect of macroeconomic coordination and the commitments of the finance ministers and how they 're taken forward .
third in respect of trade where words matter but so do systems for ensuring that open trade is protected and , if possible , advanced .
fourth , and significantly , 70 % of the world 's economic growth in the last 10 years has come from emerging and developing countries .
they are represented at the g20 .
it 's significant that the whole world is effectively around the table , not just the rich parts of the world .
so for the developing world , there are issues in play , and there 's also the low carbon aspect .
i think that is the agenda .
and it 's not about rabbits out of hats .
this is about trying to tackle an exceptional economic crisis , far beyond the financial system , and set in place measures , measures , that really do make a difference over the short-term and the medium-term .
andrew marr : so we will , we will actually see a series of specific , concrete proposals ?
david miliband : that 's certainly the andrew marr : it wo n't be general declarations ?
david miliband : no , this is not just warm words .
this is about there 's an article in the newspapers today saying 2 trillion dollars is never going to be achieved .
it actually already has been achieved !
that was actually a previous draft of the declaration .
and so substantial measures have been taken .
but it is a unique process because the truth about this is that the world 's been fundamentally unbalanced over the last 10 or 20 years - unbalanced economically between rich and poor , unbalanced environmentally , but also unbalanced politically because we 've got a global economic system but essentially national political systems .
what you see in the g20 is economic governance , issues of politics at the international level being applied to the economy really for the first time in 50 or 60 years .
and i think that is what makes this significant - not least because there 's real issues and real substance at stake .

david miliband : well i do n't think we can abandon our own independent judicial systems .
our judicial system has set in play a prosecution case .
we 've made requests to the russians .
it 's not for me to interfere in that and abandon that .
we 've had a terrible murder on british streets and it 's right that we pursue that .
equally , on the multilateral agenda we say we 've got business with the russians and , as president medvedev said , there 's also a trading link .
so we can compartmentalise those , i think .
andrew marr : and what about the british council ?
do you think relations are beginning to normalise ?
david miliband : well andrew marr : have you talked about restriction still ?
david miliband : yeah , the british council is now only operating in moscow .
andrew marr : moscow .
david miliband : the biggest losers are actually russians .
one and a quarter million russians used the british council last year .
this year , only about 500/700,000 will be able to because of the restrictions on their activity .
that 's a russian loss and i hope that they recognise that the purpose of the british council is actually to foster understanding between countries .
it 's not to pump out the line of the british government .
so i think that it is very , very important that we engage with countries like russia without fear or favour , but absolutely clear that they are as much part of this new global society as we are .
andrew marr : now we heard , we heard president medvedev talking about obama .
he and the russian president have n't met obama before , so there 's going to be a sort of kind of speed dating , diplomatic speed dating going on in london at the moment .
-lrb- miliband laughs -rrb- do you think this is a moment for a change in the tone of relations between the west and russia and also china ?
david miliband : well i do n't think it 's more than tone .
what joe biden , the us vice president said , is that he wanted to set the reset button on the us-russia relationship , and he has shown , whether on issues of nuclear proliferation or other issues , that they want to work with the russians very , very closely .
and that must be a good thing because russia has big equities in the international system .
it 's got a big role to play if it chooses to play it .
and , as i say , i think the prime minister was ahead of the curve on this last year and i think it 's right that this has followed through .
andrew marr : when it comes to running through many of the issues in front of you at the moment , when it comes to the change of policy in afghanistan announced by president obama , are we going to see another announcement of british troops to complement that ?
david miliband : well we 've not been asked by the us or by anyone else to increase our number of troops .
we have about between , around 12 % of all foreign troops in afghanistan .
the biggest increase in troops in afghanistan over the next few years is going to come from recruits of the afghan national army .
we are not in afghanistan to create a new colony .
andrew marr : so we should n't expect another boost from david miliband : -lrb- over -rrb- we always keep our troop numbers under review because we have to do so for the safety of our own troops and for our contribution to the coalition , but we have n't been asked for more troops .
what we have now is a new strategy from the us .
it 's a pakistan as well as an afghan strategy .
that 's a good thing .
it 's civilian as well as military .
that 's also a very , very good thing .
and at its heart is building the capacity of the afghan government and the pakistani government to sustain their own societies .
that 's also essential .
andrew marr : turning to domestic politics for a moment , the home secretary in trouble again over her expenses .
other ministers in trouble .
first of all , is her position any longer sustainable ?
and , second , for how long are we going to be picking up newspapers again and again with mp 's pushing absolutely to the edges and beyond what they can claim for expenses ?
this is bad for politics .
david miliband : jacqui smith is doing an outstanding job as home secretary .
i 'm not going to make any comment about individual allegations in respect of mp 's expenses .
what i know is that the system has to be much , much clearer than it was in the past .
that 's the purpose of the reforms that are being put into place .
the system has to be clear above all in the interests of the public , so that they can have trust and confidence in what i know , which is that mp 's come to westminster on all sides of the political spectrum andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- this looks a bit like final straw time for her , does n't it ?
david miliband : well i am never going to get into individual cases .
andrew marr : okay .
david miliband : what i 'm absolutely confident of is that jacqui smith is doing an outstanding job as the home secretary with some of the toughest responsibilities in government .
and i think that what counts in respect of the mp system is that the system is clear .
andrew marr : alright .
one final question .
one of the papers , i think it 's the independent on sunday , raised today the prospect of a new global summit coming up specifically on climate change and greening the world 's economy because that is the other vast issue in front of every world leader .
is that going to happen ?
is that a true report ?
david miliband : yes , it 's already been fixed .
look , one of the remarkable andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- so could you just explain about that ?
david miliband : yeah , one of the remarkable things that our prime minister has achieved since the washington summit is to broaden the agenda , so that it 's not just about finance .
it 's about the economy and about low carbon andrew marr : okay .
this specific summit ?
david miliband : and the green summit will be in december .
it 's the copenhagen summit .
it will design a replacement for the kyoto protocol .
andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- it 's the same copenhagen summit ?
there 's not a new summit of working this out ?
okay .
david miliband : -lrb- over -rrb- well i have n't read the newspaper report , but andrew marr : alright , i just wanted to be clear about that .
david miliband : the world has the responsibility this year to sort out the climate issue .
andrew marr : foreign secretary , thank you very much indeed for joining us .

please note ' the andrew marr show ' must be credited if any part of this transcript is used .
the foreign secretary says reforming the world 's financial system is the priority for the summit .
andrew marr : well we 've been hearing this morning about chinese-british relationships , about chinese-russian-british relationships , and of course this week in london we 're going to have i think one of the biggest gatherings of world leaders ever seen for this g20 summit .
david miliband mp so there is a great deal to talk about with the foreign secretary david miliband who is with me now .
welcome , foreign secretary .
david miliband : good morning , andrew .
good to be here .
andrew marr : the g20 agenda .
from what kevin rudd was saying and what 's been said in the papers as well , there is n't going to be a new announcement on the fiscal stimulus side and so i 'm still struggling to grasp what is going to be the sort of rabbit-out-of-a-hat as it were in the final communique .
are we going to see something genuinely fresh on the architecture of the world 's finances , for instance ?
david miliband : i think that what is in play at the moment - and it 's significant that discussions are still going on - is first of all real discussion about financial sector reform because , remember , the origins of this crisis are in the financial sector .
andrew marr : yes .
david miliband : secondly in respect of macroeconomic coordination and the commitments of the finance ministers and how they 're taken forward .
third in respect of trade where words matter but so do systems for ensuring that open trade is protected and , if possible , advanced .
fourth , and significantly , 70 % of the world 's economic growth in the last 10 years has come from emerging and developing countries .
they are represented at the g20 .
it 's significant that the whole world is effectively around the table , not just the rich parts of the world .
so for the developing world , there are issues in play , and there 's also the low carbon aspect .
i think that is the agenda .
and it 's not about rabbits out of hats .
this is about trying to tackle an exceptional economic crisis , far beyond the financial system , and set in place measures , measures , that really do make a difference over the short-term and the medium-term .
andrew marr : so we will , we will actually see a series of specific , concrete proposals ?
david miliband : that 's certainly the andrew marr : it wo n't be general declarations ?
david miliband : no , this is not just warm words .
this is about there 's an article in the newspapers today saying 2 trillion dollars is never going to be achieved .
it actually already has been achieved !
that was actually a previous draft of the declaration .
and so substantial measures have been taken .
but it is a unique process because the truth about this is that the world 's been fundamentally unbalanced over the last 10 or 20 years - unbalanced economically between rich and poor , unbalanced environmentally , but also unbalanced politically because we 've got a global economic system but essentially national political systems .
what you see in the g20 is economic governance , issues of politics at the international level being applied to the economy really for the first time in 50 or 60 years .
and i think that is what makes this significant - not least because there 's real issues and real substance at stake .
andrew marr : but to be absolutely clear , what we 're not going to see is another huge tranche of money around the world freshly announced .
david miliband : well this debate and this g20 summit was never about writing national budgets .
it is about the international financial architecture .
the european union has pledged $ 100 billion .
so has japan .
so there will be figures in respect of the role of the imf , in respect of helping developing countries , but it 's not about writing andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- but in terms of new you know you were talking past tense then , and i understand that , but we 're not going to see another sort of global cheque being waved at the end of this .
david miliband : well there are global cheques with respect to the imf and the world bank .
andrew marr : right , okay .
david miliband : there are not cheques to do with the british budget , which is set in april , or the german budgets , etcetera .
so this is not about substituting .
andrew marr : so when angela merkel says you know we 're not going to be spending it , we 're not going to have another fiscal boost , you know it 's wrong , let 's see how this one works - in essence we 've accepted that argument ?
david miliband : we were never trying to substitute our decisions for the german budgetary process .
the germans andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- i think she was talking about the world , not david miliband : -lrb- over -rrb- remember when i came on this programme last year , you were saying look the germans are never going to do a fiscal stimulus , they do n't agree with you .
in fact two massive budget stimuluses have been put through in germany .
4 % of german gdp , a german fiscal stimulus actually bigger than ours .
so let 's not hear this ; that somehow the anglo saxons are for fiscal policy and the other europeans are for somehow regulation .
you 've got to do both .
you 've got to mend the banking system , but you 've also got to make sure that demand is put back into the economy .
andrew marr : i went through quite a lot of the issues between russia and britain with president medvedev .
what did you make of what he was saying and the tone that was coming back ?
david miliband : well i think it 's significant and important .
gordon brown reached out to president medvedev last july at the g8 summit .
he made a particular point of saying that the russian election could be a new beginning .
and i think we 've never sought to disguise the fact that there are bilateral issues that divide us , but at the multilateral level on iran , where there were significant statements today in your interview , on climate change , on nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament , we have big issues that we need to engage with , grapple with with russia .
the russian president , the russian foreign minister are coming this week and as leaders of the security council , we 're both permanent members of the security council , we have important responsibilities where we need to work with russia .
we 've always said it should be hard-headed engagement , and i think that 's what we 're getting back from the russians .
andrew marr : and in hard-headed terms on some of those specifics , do you now accept that we 're not going to get anywhere with the lugovoy-litvinenko issue ; that he is not going to be sent for trial in a third jurisdiction ?
david miliband : well i do n't think we can abandon our own independent judicial systems .
our judicial system has set in play a prosecution case .

one and a quarter million russians used the british council last year .

that 's a russian loss and i hope that they recognise that the purpose of the british council is actually to foster understanding between countries .
it 's not to pump out the line of the british government .
so i think that it is very , very important that we engage with countries like russia without fear or favour , but absolutely clear that they are as much part of this new global society as we are .

we have about between , around 12 % of all foreign troops in afghanistan .

we are not in afghanistan to create a new colony .
andrew marr : so we should n't expect another boost from david miliband : -lrb- over -rrb- we always keep our troop numbers under review because we have to do so for the safety of our own troops and for our contribution to the coalition , but we have n't been asked for more troops .
what we have now is a new strategy from the us .
it 's a pakistan as well as an afghan strategy .
that 's a good thing .
it 's civilian as well as military .
that 's also a very , very good thing .
and at its heart is building the capacity of the afghan government and the pakistani government to sustain their own societies .
that 's also essential .
andrew marr : turning to domestic politics for a moment , the home secretary in trouble again over her expenses .
other ministers in trouble .
first of all , is her position any longer sustainable ?
and , second , for how long are we going to be picking up newspapers again and again with mp 's pushing absolutely to the edges and beyond what they can claim for expenses ?
this is bad for politics .
david miliband : jacqui smith is doing an outstanding job as home secretary .
i 'm not going to make any comment about individual allegations in respect of mp 's expenses .
what i know is that the system has to be much , much clearer than it was in the past .
that 's the purpose of the reforms that are being put into place .
the system has to be clear above all in the interests of the public , so that they can have trust and confidence in what i know , which is that mp 's come to westminster on all sides of the political spectrum andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- this looks a bit like final straw time for her , does n't it ?
david miliband : well i am never going to get into individual cases .
andrew marr : okay .
david miliband : what i 'm absolutely confident of is that jacqui smith is doing an outstanding job as the home secretary with some of the toughest responsibilities in government .
and i think that what counts in respect of the mp system is that the system is clear .
andrew marr : alright .
one final question .
one of the papers , i think it 's the independent on sunday , raised today the prospect of a new global summit coming up specifically on climate change and greening the world 's economy because that is the other vast issue in front of every world leader .
is that going to happen ?
is that a true report ?
david miliband : yes , it 's already been fixed .
look , one of the remarkable andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- so could you just explain about that ?
david miliband : yeah , one of the remarkable things that our prime minister has achieved since the washington summit is to broaden the agenda , so that it 's not just about finance .
it 's about the economy and about low carbon andrew marr : okay .
this specific summit ?
david miliband : and the green summit will be in december .
it 's the copenhagen summit .
it will design a replacement for the kyoto protocol .
andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- it 's the same copenhagen summit ?
there 's not a new summit of working this out ?
okay .
david miliband : -lrb- over -rrb- well i have n't read the newspaper report , but andrew marr : alright , i just wanted to be clear about that .
david miliband : the world has the responsibility this year to sort out the climate issue .
andrew marr : foreign secretary , thank you very much indeed for joining us .

democracy live page last updated at 09:30 gmt , sunday , 29 march 2009 10:30 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version its not about rabbits out of hats on sunday 29 march andrew marr interviewed the foreign secretary david miliband mp .
please note ' the andrew marr show ' must be credited if any part of this transcript is used .
the foreign secretary says reforming the world 's financial system is the priority for the summit .
andrew marr : well we 've been hearing this morning about chinese-british relationships , about chinese-russian-british relationships , and of course this week in london we 're going to have i think one of the biggest gatherings of world leaders ever seen for this g20 summit .
david miliband mp so there is a great deal to talk about with the foreign secretary david miliband who is with me now .
welcome , foreign secretary .
david miliband : good morning , andrew .
good to be here .
andrew marr : the g20 agenda .
from what kevin rudd was saying and what 's been said in the papers as well , there is n't going to be a new announcement on the fiscal stimulus side and so i 'm still struggling to grasp what is going to be the sort of rabbit-out-of-a-hat as it were in the final communique .
are we going to see something genuinely fresh on the architecture of the world 's finances , for instance ?
david miliband : i think that what is in play at the moment - and it 's significant that discussions are still going on - is first of all real discussion about financial sector reform because , remember , the origins of this crisis are in the financial sector .
andrew marr : yes .
david miliband : secondly in respect of macroeconomic coordination and the commitments of the finance ministers and how they 're taken forward .
third in respect of trade where words matter but so do systems for ensuring that open trade is protected and , if possible , advanced .
fourth , and significantly , 70 % of the world 's economic growth in the last 10 years has come from emerging and developing countries .
they are represented at the g20 .
it 's significant that the whole world is effectively around the table , not just the rich parts of the world .
so for the developing world , there are issues in play , and there 's also the low carbon aspect .
i think that is the agenda .
and it 's not about rabbits out of hats .
this is about trying to tackle an exceptional economic crisis , far beyond the financial system , and set in place measures , measures , that really do make a difference over the short-term and the medium-term .
andrew marr : so we will , we will actually see a series of specific , concrete proposals ?
david miliband : that 's certainly the andrew marr : it wo n't be general declarations ?
david miliband : no , this is not just warm words .
this is about there 's an article in the newspapers today saying 2 trillion dollars is never going to be achieved .
it actually already has been achieved !
that was actually a previous draft of the declaration .
and so substantial measures have been taken .
but it is a unique process because the truth about this is that the world 's been fundamentally unbalanced over the last 10 or 20 years - unbalanced economically between rich and poor , unbalanced environmentally , but also unbalanced politically because we 've got a global economic system but essentially national political systems .
what you see in the g20 is economic governance , issues of politics at the international level being applied to the economy really for the first time in 50 or 60 years .
and i think that is what makes this significant - not least because there 's real issues and real substance at stake .
andrew marr : but to be absolutely clear , what we 're not going to see is another huge tranche of money around the world freshly announced .
david miliband : well this debate and this g20 summit was never about writing national budgets .
it is about the international financial architecture .
the european union has pledged $ 100 billion .
so has japan .
so there will be figures in respect of the role of the imf , in respect of helping developing countries , but it 's not about writing andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- but in terms of new you know you were talking past tense then , and i understand that , but we 're not going to see another sort of global cheque being waved at the end of this .
david miliband : well there are global cheques with respect to the imf and the world bank .
andrew marr : right , okay .
david miliband : there are not cheques to do with the british budget , which is set in april , or the german budgets , etcetera .
so this is not about substituting .
andrew marr : so when angela merkel says you know we 're not going to be spending it , we 're not going to have another fiscal boost , you know it 's wrong , let 's see how this one works - in essence we 've accepted that argument ?
david miliband : we were never trying to substitute our decisions for the german budgetary process .
the germans andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- i think she was talking about the world , not david miliband : -lrb- over -rrb- remember when i came on this programme last year , you were saying look the germans are never going to do a fiscal stimulus , they do n't agree with you .
in fact two massive budget stimuluses have been put through in germany .
4 % of german gdp , a german fiscal stimulus actually bigger than ours .
so let 's not hear this ; that somehow the anglo saxons are for fiscal policy and the other europeans are for somehow regulation .
you 've got to do both .
you 've got to mend the banking system , but you 've also got to make sure that demand is put back into the economy .
andrew marr : i went through quite a lot of the issues between russia and britain with president medvedev .
what did you make of what he was saying and the tone that was coming back ?
david miliband : well i think it 's significant and important .
gordon brown reached out to president medvedev last july at the g8 summit .
he made a particular point of saying that the russian election could be a new beginning .
and i think we 've never sought to disguise the fact that there are bilateral issues that divide us , but at the multilateral level on iran , where there were significant statements today in your interview , on climate change , on nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament , we have big issues that we need to engage with , grapple with with russia .
the russian president , the russian foreign minister are coming this week and as leaders of the security council , we 're both permanent members of the security council , we have important responsibilities where we need to work with russia .
we 've always said it should be hard-headed engagement , and i think that 's what we 're getting back from the russians .
andrew marr : and in hard-headed terms on some of those specifics , do you now accept that we 're not going to get anywhere with the lugovoy-litvinenko issue ; that he is not going to be sent for trial in a third jurisdiction ?
david miliband : well i do n't think we can abandon our own independent judicial systems .
our judicial system has set in play a prosecution case .
we 've made requests to the russians .
it 's not for me to interfere in that and abandon that .
we 've had a terrible murder on british streets and it 's right that we pursue that .
equally , on the multilateral agenda we say we 've got business with the russians and , as president medvedev said , there 's also a trading link .
so we can compartmentalise those , i think .
andrew marr : and what about the british council ?
do you think relations are beginning to normalise ?
david miliband : well andrew marr : have you talked about restriction still ?
david miliband : yeah , the british council is now only operating in moscow .
andrew marr : moscow .
david miliband : the biggest losers are actually russians .
one and a quarter million russians used the british council last year .
this year , only about 500/700,000 will be able to because of the restrictions on their activity .
that 's a russian loss and i hope that they recognise that the purpose of the british council is actually to foster understanding between countries .
it 's not to pump out the line of the british government .
so i think that it is very , very important that we engage with countries like russia without fear or favour , but absolutely clear that they are as much part of this new global society as we are .
andrew marr : now we heard , we heard president medvedev talking about obama .
he and the russian president have n't met obama before , so there 's going to be a sort of kind of speed dating , diplomatic speed dating going on in london at the moment .
-lrb- miliband laughs -rrb- do you think this is a moment for a change in the tone of relations between the west and russia and also china ?
david miliband : well i do n't think it 's more than tone .
what joe biden , the us vice president said , is that he wanted to set the reset button on the us-russia relationship , and he has shown , whether on issues of nuclear proliferation or other issues , that they want to work with the russians very , very closely .
and that must be a good thing because russia has big equities in the international system .
it 's got a big role to play if it chooses to play it .
and , as i say , i think the prime minister was ahead of the curve on this last year and i think it 's right that this has followed through .
andrew marr : when it comes to running through many of the issues in front of you at the moment , when it comes to the change of policy in afghanistan announced by president obama , are we going to see another announcement of british troops to complement that ?
david miliband : well we 've not been asked by the us or by anyone else to increase our number of troops .
we have about between , around 12 % of all foreign troops in afghanistan .
the biggest increase in troops in afghanistan over the next few years is going to come from recruits of the afghan national army .
we are not in afghanistan to create a new colony .
andrew marr : so we should n't expect another boost from david miliband : -lrb- over -rrb- we always keep our troop numbers under review because we have to do so for the safety of our own troops and for our contribution to the coalition , but we have n't been asked for more troops .

one final question .
one of the papers , i think it 's the independent on sunday , raised today the prospect of a new global summit coming up specifically on climate change and greening the world 's economy because that is the other vast issue in front of every world leader .
is that going to happen ?
is that a true report ?
david miliband : yes , it 's already been fixed .
look , one of the remarkable andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- so could you just explain about that ?
david miliband : yeah , one of the remarkable things that our prime minister has achieved since the washington summit is to broaden the agenda , so that it 's not just about finance .

please note ' the andrew marr show ' must be credited if any part of this transcript is used .
the foreign secretary says reforming the world 's financial system is the priority for the summit .
andrew marr : well we 've been hearing this morning about chinese-british relationships , about chinese-russian-british relationships , and of course this week in london we 're going to have i think one of the biggest gatherings of world leaders ever seen for this g20 summit .
david miliband mp so there is a great deal to talk about with the foreign secretary david miliband who is with me now .
welcome , foreign secretary .
david miliband : good morning , andrew .
good to be here .
andrew marr : the g20 agenda .
from what kevin rudd was saying and what 's been said in the papers as well , there is n't going to be a new announcement on the fiscal stimulus side and so i 'm still struggling to grasp what is going to be the sort of rabbit-out-of-a-hat as it were in the final communique .
are we going to see something genuinely fresh on the architecture of the world 's finances , for instance ?
david miliband : i think that what is in play at the moment - and it 's significant that discussions are still going on - is first of all real discussion about financial sector reform because , remember , the origins of this crisis are in the financial sector .
andrew marr : yes .
david miliband : secondly in respect of macroeconomic coordination and the commitments of the finance ministers and how they 're taken forward .
third in respect of trade where words matter but so do systems for ensuring that open trade is protected and , if possible , advanced .
fourth , and significantly , 70 % of the world 's economic growth in the last 10 years has come from emerging and developing countries .
they are represented at the g20 .
it 's significant that the whole world is effectively around the table , not just the rich parts of the world .
so for the developing world , there are issues in play , and there 's also the low carbon aspect .
i think that is the agenda .
and it 's not about rabbits out of hats .
this is about trying to tackle an exceptional economic crisis , far beyond the financial system , and set in place measures , measures , that really do make a difference over the short-term and the medium-term .
andrew marr : so we will , we will actually see a series of specific , concrete proposals ?
david miliband : that 's certainly the andrew marr : it wo n't be general declarations ?
david miliband : no , this is not just warm words .
this is about there 's an article in the newspapers today saying 2 trillion dollars is never going to be achieved .
it actually already has been achieved !
that was actually a previous draft of the declaration .
and so substantial measures have been taken .
but it is a unique process because the truth about this is that the world 's been fundamentally unbalanced over the last 10 or 20 years - unbalanced economically between rich and poor , unbalanced environmentally , but also unbalanced politically because we 've got a global economic system but essentially national political systems .
what you see in the g20 is economic governance , issues of politics at the international level being applied to the economy really for the first time in 50 or 60 years .
and i think that is what makes this significant - not least because there 's real issues and real substance at stake .
andrew marr : but to be absolutely clear , what we 're not going to see is another huge tranche of money around the world freshly announced .
david miliband : well this debate and this g20 summit was never about writing national budgets .
it is about the international financial architecture .
the european union has pledged $ 100 billion .
so has japan .
so there will be figures in respect of the role of the imf , in respect of helping developing countries , but it 's not about writing andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- but in terms of new you know you were talking past tense then , and i understand that , but we 're not going to see another sort of global cheque being waved at the end of this .
david miliband : well there are global cheques with respect to the imf and the world bank .
andrew marr : right , okay .
david miliband : there are not cheques to do with the british budget , which is set in april , or the german budgets , etcetera .
so this is not about substituting .
andrew marr : so when angela merkel says you know we 're not going to be spending it , we 're not going to have another fiscal boost , you know it 's wrong , let 's see how this one works - in essence we 've accepted that argument ?
david miliband : we were never trying to substitute our decisions for the german budgetary process .
the germans andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- i think she was talking about the world , not david miliband : -lrb- over -rrb- remember when i came on this programme last year , you were saying look the germans are never going to do a fiscal stimulus , they do n't agree with you .
in fact two massive budget stimuluses have been put through in germany .
4 % of german gdp , a german fiscal stimulus actually bigger than ours .
so let 's not hear this ; that somehow the anglo saxons are for fiscal policy and the other europeans are for somehow regulation .
you 've got to do both .
you 've got to mend the banking system , but you 've also got to make sure that demand is put back into the economy .
andrew marr : i went through quite a lot of the issues between russia and britain with president medvedev .
what did you make of what he was saying and the tone that was coming back ?
david miliband : well i think it 's significant and important .
gordon brown reached out to president medvedev last july at the g8 summit .
he made a particular point of saying that the russian election could be a new beginning .
and i think we 've never sought to disguise the fact that there are bilateral issues that divide us , but at the multilateral level on iran , where there were significant statements today in your interview , on climate change , on nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament , we have big issues that we need to engage with , grapple with with russia .
the russian president , the russian foreign minister are coming this week and as leaders of the security council , we 're both permanent members of the security council , we have important responsibilities where we need to work with russia .
we 've always said it should be hard-headed engagement , and i think that 's what we 're getting back from the russians .
andrew marr : and in hard-headed terms on some of those specifics , do you now accept that we 're not going to get anywhere with the lugovoy-litvinenko issue ; that he is not going to be sent for trial in a third jurisdiction ?
david miliband : well i do n't think we can abandon our own independent judicial systems .
our judicial system has set in play a prosecution case .
we 've made requests to the russians .
it 's not for me to interfere in that and abandon that .
we 've had a terrible murder on british streets and it 's right that we pursue that .
equally , on the multilateral agenda we say we 've got business with the russians and , as president medvedev said , there 's also a trading link .
so we can compartmentalise those , i think .
andrew marr : and what about the british council ?
do you think relations are beginning to normalise ?
david miliband : well andrew marr : have you talked about restriction still ?
david miliband : yeah , the british council is now only operating in moscow .
andrew marr : moscow .
david miliband : the biggest losers are actually russians .
one and a quarter million russians used the british council last year .
this year , only about 500/700,000 will be able to because of the restrictions on their activity .
that 's a russian loss and i hope that they recognise that the purpose of the british council is actually to foster understanding between countries .
it 's not to pump out the line of the british government .
so i think that it is very , very important that we engage with countries like russia without fear or favour , but absolutely clear that they are as much part of this new global society as we are .
andrew marr : now we heard , we heard president medvedev talking about obama .
he and the russian president have n't met obama before , so there 's going to be a sort of kind of speed dating , diplomatic speed dating going on in london at the moment .
-lrb- miliband laughs -rrb- do you think this is a moment for a change in the tone of relations between the west and russia and also china ?
david miliband : well i do n't think it 's more than tone .
what joe biden , the us vice president said , is that he wanted to set the reset button on the us-russia relationship , and he has shown , whether on issues of nuclear proliferation or other issues , that they want to work with the russians very , very closely .
and that must be a good thing because russia has big equities in the international system .
it 's got a big role to play if it chooses to play it .
and , as i say , i think the prime minister was ahead of the curve on this last year and i think it 's right that this has followed through .
andrew marr : when it comes to running through many of the issues in front of you at the moment , when it comes to the change of policy in afghanistan announced by president obama , are we going to see another announcement of british troops to complement that ?
david miliband : well we 've not been asked by the us or by anyone else to increase our number of troops .
we have about between , around 12 % of all foreign troops in afghanistan .
the biggest increase in troops in afghanistan over the next few years is going to come from recruits of the afghan national army .
we are not in afghanistan to create a new colony .
andrew marr : so we should n't expect another boost from david miliband : -lrb- over -rrb- we always keep our troop numbers under review because we have to do so for the safety of our own troops and for our contribution to the coalition , but we have n't been asked for more troops .
what we have now is a new strategy from the us .
it 's a pakistan as well as an afghan strategy .
that 's a good thing .
it 's civilian as well as military .
that 's also a very , very good thing .
and at its heart is building the capacity of the afghan government and the pakistani government to sustain their own societies .
that 's also essential .
andrew marr : turning to domestic politics for a moment , the home secretary in trouble again over her expenses .
other ministers in trouble .
first of all , is her position any longer sustainable ?
and , second , for how long are we going to be picking up newspapers again and again with mp 's pushing absolutely to the edges and beyond what they can claim for expenses ?
this is bad for politics .
david miliband : jacqui smith is doing an outstanding job as home secretary .
i 'm not going to make any comment about individual allegations in respect of mp 's expenses .
what i know is that the system has to be much , much clearer than it was in the past .
that 's the purpose of the reforms that are being put into place .
the system has to be clear above all in the interests of the public , so that they can have trust and confidence in what i know , which is that mp 's come to westminster on all sides of the political spectrum andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- this looks a bit like final straw time for her , does n't it ?
david miliband : well i am never going to get into individual cases .
andrew marr : okay .
david miliband : what i 'm absolutely confident of is that jacqui smith is doing an outstanding job as the home secretary with some of the toughest responsibilities in government .
and i think that what counts in respect of the mp system is that the system is clear .
andrew marr : alright .
one final question .
one of the papers , i think it 's the independent on sunday , raised today the prospect of a new global summit coming up specifically on climate change and greening the world 's economy because that is the other vast issue in front of every world leader .
is that going to happen ?
is that a true report ?
david miliband : yes , it 's already been fixed .
look , one of the remarkable andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- so could you just explain about that ?
david miliband : yeah , one of the remarkable things that our prime minister has achieved since the washington summit is to broaden the agenda , so that it 's not just about finance .
it 's about the economy and about low carbon andrew marr : okay .
this specific summit ?
david miliband : and the green summit will be in december .
it 's the copenhagen summit .
it will design a replacement for the kyoto protocol .
andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- it 's the same copenhagen summit ?
there 's not a new summit of working this out ?
okay .
david miliband : -lrb- over -rrb- well i have n't read the newspaper report , but andrew marr : alright , i just wanted to be clear about that .
david miliband : the world has the responsibility this year to sort out the climate issue .

the foreign secretary says reforming the world 's financial system is the priority for the summit .
andrew marr : well we 've been hearing this morning about chinese-british relationships , about chinese-russian-british relationships , and of course this week in london we 're going to have i think one of the biggest gatherings of world leaders ever seen for this g20 summit .
so there is a great deal to talk about with the foreign secretary david miliband who is with me now .
welcome , foreign secretary .
david miliband : good morning , andrew .
good to be here .
andrew marr : the g20 agenda .
from what kevin rudd was saying and what 's been said in the papers as well , there is n't going to be a new announcement on the fiscal stimulus side and so i 'm still struggling to grasp what is going to be the sort of rabbit-out-of-a-hat as it were in the final communique .
are we going to see something genuinely fresh on the architecture of the world 's finances , for instance ?
david miliband : i think that what is in play at the moment - and it 's significant that discussions are still going on - is first of all real discussion about financial sector reform because , remember , the origins of this crisis are in the financial sector .
andrew marr : yes .
david miliband : secondly in respect of macroeconomic coordination and the commitments of the finance ministers and how they 're taken forward .
third in respect of trade where words matter but so do systems for ensuring that open trade is protected and , if possible , advanced .
fourth , and significantly , 70 % of the world 's economic growth in the last 10 years has come from emerging and developing countries .
they are represented at the g20 .
it 's significant that the whole world is effectively around the table , not just the rich parts of the world .
so for the developing world , there are issues in play , and there 's also the low carbon aspect .
i think that is the agenda .
and it 's not about rabbits out of hats .
this is about trying to tackle an exceptional economic crisis , far beyond the financial system , and set in place measures , measures , that really do make a difference over the short-term and the medium-term .
andrew marr : so we will , we will actually see a series of specific , concrete proposals ?
david miliband : that 's certainly the andrew marr : it wo n't be general declarations ?
david miliband : no , this is not just warm words .
this is about there 's an article in the newspapers today saying 2 trillion dollars is never going to be achieved .
it actually already has been achieved !
that was actually a previous draft of the declaration .
and so substantial measures have been taken .
but it is a unique process because the truth about this is that the world 's been fundamentally unbalanced over the last 10 or 20 years - unbalanced economically between rich and poor , unbalanced environmentally , but also unbalanced politically because we 've got a global economic system but essentially national political systems .
what you see in the g20 is economic governance , issues of politics at the international level being applied to the economy really for the first time in 50 or 60 years .
and i think that is what makes this significant - not least because there 's real issues and real substance at stake .
andrew marr : but to be absolutely clear , what we 're not going to see is another huge tranche of money around the world freshly announced .
david miliband : well this debate and this g20 summit was never about writing national budgets .
it is about the international financial architecture .
the european union has pledged $ 100 billion .
so has japan .
so there will be figures in respect of the role of the imf , in respect of helping developing countries , but it 's not about writing andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- but in terms of new you know you were talking past tense then , and i understand that , but we 're not going to see another sort of global cheque being waved at the end of this .
david miliband : well there are global cheques with respect to the imf and the world bank .
andrew marr : right , okay .
david miliband : there are not cheques to do with the british budget , which is set in april , or the german budgets , etcetera .
so this is not about substituting .
andrew marr : so when angela merkel says you know we 're not going to be spending it , we 're not going to have another fiscal boost , you know it 's wrong , let 's see how this one works - in essence we 've accepted that argument ?
david miliband : we were never trying to substitute our decisions for the german budgetary process .
the germans andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- i think she was talking about the world , not david miliband : -lrb- over -rrb- remember when i came on this programme last year , you were saying look the germans are never going to do a fiscal stimulus , they do n't agree with you .
in fact two massive budget stimuluses have been put through in germany .
4 % of german gdp , a german fiscal stimulus actually bigger than ours .
so let 's not hear this ; that somehow the anglo saxons are for fiscal policy and the other europeans are for somehow regulation .
you 've got to do both .
you 've got to mend the banking system , but you 've also got to make sure that demand is put back into the economy .
andrew marr : i went through quite a lot of the issues between russia and britain with president medvedev .
what did you make of what he was saying and the tone that was coming back ?
david miliband : well i think it 's significant and important .
gordon brown reached out to president medvedev last july at the g8 summit .
he made a particular point of saying that the russian election could be a new beginning .
and i think we 've never sought to disguise the fact that there are bilateral issues that divide us , but at the multilateral level on iran , where there were significant statements today in your interview , on climate change , on nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament , we have big issues that we need to engage with , grapple with with russia .
the russian president , the russian foreign minister are coming this week and as leaders of the security council , we 're both permanent members of the security council , we have important responsibilities where we need to work with russia .
we 've always said it should be hard-headed engagement , and i think that 's what we 're getting back from the russians .
andrew marr : and in hard-headed terms on some of those specifics , do you now accept that we 're not going to get anywhere with the lugovoy-litvinenko issue ; that he is not going to be sent for trial in a third jurisdiction ?
david miliband : well i do n't think we can abandon our own independent judicial systems .
our judicial system has set in play a prosecution case .
we 've made requests to the russians .
it 's not for me to interfere in that and abandon that .
we 've had a terrible murder on british streets and it 's right that we pursue that .
equally , on the multilateral agenda we say we 've got business with the russians and , as president medvedev said , there 's also a trading link .
so we can compartmentalise those , i think .
andrew marr : and what about the british council ?
do you think relations are beginning to normalise ?
david miliband : well andrew marr : have you talked about restriction still ?
david miliband : yeah , the british council is now only operating in moscow .
andrew marr : moscow .
david miliband : the biggest losers are actually russians .
one and a quarter million russians used the british council last year .
this year , only about 500/700,000 will be able to because of the restrictions on their activity .
that 's a russian loss and i hope that they recognise that the purpose of the british council is actually to foster understanding between countries .
it 's not to pump out the line of the british government .
so i think that it is very , very important that we engage with countries like russia without fear or favour , but absolutely clear that they are as much part of this new global society as we are .
andrew marr : now we heard , we heard president medvedev talking about obama .
he and the russian president have n't met obama before , so there 's going to be a sort of kind of speed dating , diplomatic speed dating going on in london at the moment .
-lrb- miliband laughs -rrb- do you think this is a moment for a change in the tone of relations between the west and russia and also china ?
david miliband : well i do n't think it 's more than tone .
what joe biden , the us vice president said , is that he wanted to set the reset button on the us-russia relationship , and he has shown , whether on issues of nuclear proliferation or other issues , that they want to work with the russians very , very closely .
and that must be a good thing because russia has big equities in the international system .
it 's got a big role to play if it chooses to play it .
and , as i say , i think the prime minister was ahead of the curve on this last year and i think it 's right that this has followed through .
andrew marr : when it comes to running through many of the issues in front of you at the moment , when it comes to the change of policy in afghanistan announced by president obama , are we going to see another announcement of british troops to complement that ?
david miliband : well we 've not been asked by the us or by anyone else to increase our number of troops .
we have about between , around 12 % of all foreign troops in afghanistan .
the biggest increase in troops in afghanistan over the next few years is going to come from recruits of the afghan national army .
we are not in afghanistan to create a new colony .
andrew marr : so we should n't expect another boost from david miliband : -lrb- over -rrb- we always keep our troop numbers under review because we have to do so for the safety of our own troops and for our contribution to the coalition , but we have n't been asked for more troops .
what we have now is a new strategy from the us .
it 's a pakistan as well as an afghan strategy .
that 's a good thing .
it 's civilian as well as military .
that 's also a very , very good thing .
and at its heart is building the capacity of the afghan government and the pakistani government to sustain their own societies .
that 's also essential .
andrew marr : turning to domestic politics for a moment , the home secretary in trouble again over her expenses .
other ministers in trouble .
first of all , is her position any longer sustainable ?
and , second , for how long are we going to be picking up newspapers again and again with mp 's pushing absolutely to the edges and beyond what they can claim for expenses ?
this is bad for politics .
david miliband : jacqui smith is doing an outstanding job as home secretary .
i 'm not going to make any comment about individual allegations in respect of mp 's expenses .
what i know is that the system has to be much , much clearer than it was in the past .
that 's the purpose of the reforms that are being put into place .
the system has to be clear above all in the interests of the public , so that they can have trust and confidence in what i know , which is that mp 's come to westminster on all sides of the political spectrum andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- this looks a bit like final straw time for her , does n't it ?
david miliband : well i am never going to get into individual cases .
andrew marr : okay .
david miliband : what i 'm absolutely confident of is that jacqui smith is doing an outstanding job as the home secretary with some of the toughest responsibilities in government .
and i think that what counts in respect of the mp system is that the system is clear .
andrew marr : alright .
one final question .
one of the papers , i think it 's the independent on sunday , raised today the prospect of a new global summit coming up specifically on climate change and greening the world 's economy because that is the other vast issue in front of every world leader .
is that going to happen ?
is that a true report ?
david miliband : yes , it 's already been fixed .
look , one of the remarkable andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- so could you just explain about that ?
david miliband : yeah , one of the remarkable things that our prime minister has achieved since the washington summit is to broaden the agenda , so that it 's not just about finance .
it 's about the economy and about low carbon andrew marr : okay .
this specific summit ?
david miliband : and the green summit will be in december .
it 's the copenhagen summit .
it will design a replacement for the kyoto protocol .
andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- it 's the same copenhagen summit ?
there 's not a new summit of working this out ?
okay .
david miliband : -lrb- over -rrb- well i have n't read the newspaper report , but andrew marr : alright , i just wanted to be clear about that .
david miliband : the world has the responsibility this year to sort out the climate issue .
andrew marr : foreign secretary , thank you very much indeed for joining us .

please note ' the andrew marr show ' must be credited if any part of this transcript is used .
andrew marr : now the chinese president also has n't met president obama , and that 'll be another important meeting at this g20 .
the chinese economy is so vast , some observers have declared that only two countries really matter this week : obama 's america and china .
the economist magazine said it 's not the g20 we should be worried about , it 's the g2 .
well the chinese ambassador to london , madam fu ying , is here with me .
good morning , ambassador fu ying : good morning .
andrew marr : and welcome .
fu ying : thank you .
andrew marr : do you expect there to be a specific deal at the g20 when it comes to a fiscal boost for the world , something that we have n't heard before ?
fu ying : thank you for having me here , andrew .
the london summit is very important .
i 'm sure the countries , the leaders who come here all have an objective to bring the summit a success and they are bound to have an agreement about how they speak in one voice to the world and how to tell the world that they are going to stimulate the economy , they are going to boost the market , they are going to restore the confidence , they 're going to help people in difficult situations and continue to provide aid to the poor countries , for example .
although they may not be able to fix the whole thing in one day , but it 's going to be an important process in the global effort to tackle the crisis .
andrew marr : if there is one country in the world which has still got money , big amounts of money to spend if it chose to , it 's china .
and people have speculated about china deciding to build a western style health service or a welfare system or something really big .
could we see that coming out or being announced at this conference ?
fu ying : i think china , we in china feel very flattered , over flattered -lrb- marr laughs -rrb- when we were given all these big hats of being rich , being wealthy , having huge reserves .
and also there is a misunderstanding of the reserves in china .
the reserves are not the money of the government .
the premier can not write a cheque on it .
it 's the money that the chinese people and the chinese businesses who left in safekeeping of the central bank , and the central bank has to look after them and take good care of them .
and the reserves , the size is big .
but if you remember , there are 1.3 billion people in china and when you divide with that number it comes to a very small number .
it 's about £ 1,000 .
so people should remember that china indeed is still a developing country and our per capita gdp is only 3,000 , although we are number three in the world in aggregate terms .
andrew marr : so people should n't be looking for a big extra spending boost from china ?
fu ying : for spending boost , i think the government in china has realised that this is hitting china hard .
although it 's not hitting the banks - our banks are fairly well regulated - but it 's hitting the people , the families .
the migrant workers have lost jobs because the factories which have been producing for export are closing down .
so the government moved very fast to come up with a huge stimulus package of 4 thousand billion us dollars of stimulus , -lrb- sic -rrb- -lrb- correct figure 400 billion pounds sterling -rrb- , which will most of which will go into like rural development , public health , education , ecological related projects .
and the premier announced that he is ready to come up with more if we have to , which means we are running the largest fiscal deficit we 've ever seen in 20 years .
andrew marr : now you would like china obviously to take a bigger role at organisations like the imf .
do you also want is it accurately reported that you 'd like to see an end to the dollar as the world 's reserve currency ?
fu ying : there 's two parts of the question .
on imf - china is fulfilling its quota in the imf , which is under 4 % , but if people want china to contribute more , we hope there is going to be a reform to increase our quota .
we 'll be happy to do more .
andrew marr : so your voting power in effect , yeah ?
fu ying : that 's right , that 's right , that 's right .
and we also announced the vice premier wrote an article to the times that we will take an open attitude if the imf is looking for alternative contributions , and maybe if imf issues a bond we 'll see how good it is and we 'll see if we can contribute .
andrew marr : and on the dollar ?
fu ying : and talking about the dollar , there has been a very interesting debate about the reserve currency and the replacement of the reserve currency , and this topic has become very hot on the chinese web at this moment too .
but it has been a long debate in the world .
there is nothing new , there is nothing new .
and china is not calling for a replacement .
it 's an article written by the governor of the central bank on his bank 's website and he 's , i think he 's joining the debate .
and it 's not it 's natural that china is having a debate of this type because we 're experiencing a global crisis we 've never seen .
andrew marr : yes , sure .
fu ying : people are asking questions .
we are trying to understand the situation .
andrew marr : you face of course many questions about human rights in china .
if china is going to become part of this global system and there 's much more transparency in banking and so on , do you accept that it 's going to be impossible and wrong for china to carry on screening newspapers , screening the internet , censoring news from outside ?
that you 're going to have to be part of an open system in every way ?
fu ying : andrew , i have to say that we in china often find it arrogant for the west to think that the human rights development in china has to be taken care of by the west - an assumption that you have a supreme , superior system everybody has to copy from you .
i think that andrew marr : that sounds like a no to me .
is it ambassador ?
fu ying : i think it 's important that we have a equal dialogue on human rights and also acknowledgement , acceptance that china has made huge progress regarding human rights .
and as far as the open society is concerned , china has become a very , very lively , open society , and everybody who has been in china will see it .
andrew marr : ambassador , thank you very much indeed for joining us this morning .
fu ying : thank you .
andrew marr : that was madam fu ying , the chinese ambassador in london .

please note ' the andrew marr show ' must be credited if any part of this transcript is used .
the australian prime minister , kevin rudd , plays down expectations of the g20 .
andrew marr : now then , just imagine a left of centre prime minister who had called for spending restraint before the crash and was still very popular now .
a bit hard to get your head round , but i am describing kevin rudd , the australian prime minister , who is with me now .
welcome , prime minister .
kevin rudd : thanks for having me on your programme .
andrew marr : the g20 kevin rudd : yuh .
andrew marr : a crucial moment for the world economy .
australia 's had how hard a time has australia been having economically recently and what 's your prognosis for the next 12 months ?
kevin rudd : well it 's a global economic recession .
it 's affecting all economies , developed and developing .
and to put it into context , i mean this is the first time in 2009 that we 're going to see the global economy contract since the war .
i mean this is a big , big event in economic history .
you see the same in trade flows and investment flows .
therefore , in australia we 're affected like everyone else .
we 're performing relatively well against most global economic benchmarks , our banks are doing okay , but this is a global contagion .
on your question about the g20 , given that this is a global economic challenge , only the g20 has the global economic reach to provide the response necessary to begin to mend this global economic recession and to support the restoration of jobs around the world .
andrew marr : it 's pretty clear there 's not going to be the huge coordinated fiscal stimulus that some have called for because not enough countries support that .
so what in real terms do you want to get out of this ?
do you think the world banking system needs to be radically reformed , and is that the kind of story that could come out of this ?
kevin rudd : well let me take your assumption head on .
i think it 's absolutely wrong , and let me tell you why .
you see what we did back in andrew marr : on the fiscal stimulus ?
kevin rudd : yes , absolutely .
andrew marr : yuh .
kevin rudd : let me go back to where this began .
the washington g20 summit in only november last year - it agreed that as governments around the world , we would commission fiscal stimulus as necessary and appropriate to support growth and jobs given the challenge ahead in the global economy .
what 's happened since then ?
since then governments around the world have agreed in calendar year 09 on action already equal to about 2 % of global gdp .
that 's 2 % of a 63 trillion dollar global economy .
what does the imf tell us about the impact of that ?
that action alone , equalling 2 % of global gdp , means supporting nearly 20 million more jobs than would otherwise be the case .
in other words , global unemployment in these economies will be 20 million worse , and i think it is absolutely important that we recognise the consistency of that .
and let me just add andrew marr : sorry , could i just kevin rudd : one further point .
one further point and then you come back on me .
in london just a couple of weekends ago , you had g20 finance ministers , including everybody - europeans , the brits , ourselves .
what did it agree on ?
it agreed to continue to support fiscal stimulus and to use the international monetary fund to assess in the future what further stimulus beyond 2009 we may need .
that is into 2010 .
what i see across these three critical meetings is actual consistency ; and had we not acted , would you want 20 million more people unemployed ?
i do n't think so .
andrew marr : no , but what we 're talking about there is as it were past decisions already taken .
kevin rudd : no , no andrew marr : barack obama 's done his .
kevin rudd : an agreement , an agreement on how to handle it in the future as well - the mechanism being an imf assessment as to how it 's done .
i think there 's andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- the french and the germans say you know no to another big fiscal stimulus .
britain has spent about as much money as is possible .
the same is probably true of what barack obama is doing .
there 's not going to be a second wave of fiscal stimulus as a result of this week 's meeting , is there ?
kevin rudd : well let 's go to the numbers .
in america you have fiscal stimulus of something like 5.4 % of gdp .
for us , about i think 4.6 % of gdp .
the germans , 3.6 % of gdp .
and in calendar year 09 people are acting in broadly the same order of magnitude - some differences here , some differences there .
that 's the action we commissioned only four or five months ago .
it is now done .
the job 's impact is about 20 million strong .
go to the future , what we 've also agreed is let 's put some maths to this , use the international monetary fund .
and all finance ministers - german , british , australian , american -agreed only a few weekends ago that we would use the imf to assess what we would need for calendar year 10 .
so i think there is a great and i think disproportionate emphasis about disagreements at the margins when in fact much has concretely been achieved with a mechanism for the future .
andrew marr : so we should not be looking to the final communique for more numbers and new numbers that we have n't seen before ?
kevin rudd : but that was never the intention .
andrew marr : -lrb- over -rrb- okay , let 's be clear about this .
kevin rudd : i think this has just been quite wrong and a mechanism has been established for us to reflect on for what we need for the future .
and there 'll be a further summit well in time for 2010 , i assume , which will actually look at what metrics would be needed then , what numbers then .
i think we need to andrew marr : so kevin rudd : ... we actually need to look at what 's been done and the impact of what would have occurred in the global economy had that not occurred .
andrew marr : so when george soros for instance says that if this summit is n't a success , does n't change things , the world is heading for depression - that 's wrong ?
kevin rudd : well the fiscal stimulus debate that you and i have just been engaged in is one of about four or five sets of integrated measures .
the other is dealing with toxic assets on bank balance sheets .
progress has been achieved here in britain and in america and elsewhere .
a framework is agreed for how that should be done .
avoiding further acts of protectionism ; dealing with the resources necessary for the imf because if we do n't have proper resources for the international monetary fund the big problems emerging now in central and eastern europe would in fact rebound on the rest of the global economy .
and in each of these four areas , there is real , measurable progress , and a further work programme for the future .
andrew marr : and you think there needs to be another g20 meeting before too long to keep that progress moving forward ?
kevin rudd : i think momentum is necessary .
i think if you step back from all this and ask yourself this question - when else in modern economic history have global economies cooperated and coordinated across such a vast array of policy instruments ? - it has n't happened .
gordon brown has been in the centre of this at the washington summit , but most particularly in the lead up to this one , and that coordination role on the part of the british has been first class .
you 're never going to get a perfect outcome in these circumstances , it 's a political process .
but against what has existed previous , i 've got to say we need to see the glass as being more than half full andrew marr : okay .
kevin rudd : on these questions rather than emphasising what has yet to be done .
andrew marr : everybody is focusing for obvious reasons on the financial crisis , but you 've had some terrible fires in australia .
there is also the huge question of climate change .
talk about another big summit on that as well coming up i think before too long .
how important is it that this financial crisis is a moment when people start to turn their economies in a different direction when it comes to low carbon technologies and all of that ?
kevin rudd : you 're right to raise the fact that we have a challenge now of dealing with the global financial crisis , a real challenge in the economy and jobs .
the interconnectedness of what happens on banks in the city of london and banks on wall street and what happens with jobs in brisbane and what happens with jobs in birmingham , these are all linked .
but at the same time , what we need to also bear in mind is that this continued challenge of climate change is a massive economic challenge as well .
it 's very clear that the costs of economic the costs of inaction on climate change in economic terms are far greater than the costs of action , so , therefore , when we look at stimulus , we look at the other things that are necessary to deal with the economic crisis , we should also be taking steps to prepare ourselves for a more sustainable carbon future as well .
andrew marr : alright .
for now , kevin rudd , thank you very much indeed .

but if you remember , there are 1.3 billion people in china and when you divide with that number it comes to a very small number .
it 's about £ 1,000 .
so people should remember that china indeed is still a developing country and our per capita gdp is only 3,000 , although we are number three in the world in aggregate terms .
andrew marr : so people should n't be looking for a big extra spending boost from china ?
fu ying : for spending boost , i think the government in china has realised that this is hitting china hard .
although it 's not hitting the banks - our banks are fairly well regulated - but it 's hitting the people , the families .
the migrant workers have lost jobs because the factories which have been producing for export are closing down .
so the government moved very fast to come up with a huge stimulus package of 4 thousand billion us dollars of stimulus , -lrb- sic -rrb- -lrb- correct figure 400 billion pounds sterling -rrb- , which will most of which will go into like rural development , public health , education , ecological related projects .
and the premier announced that he is ready to come up with more if we have to , which means we are running the largest fiscal deficit we 've ever seen in 20 years .
andrew marr : now you would like china obviously to take a bigger role at organisations like the imf .
do you also want is it accurately reported that you 'd like to see an end to the dollar as the world 's reserve currency ?
fu ying : there 's two parts of the question .
on imf - china is fulfilling its quota in the imf , which is under 4 % , but if people want china to contribute more , we hope there is going to be a reform to increase our quota .
we 'll be happy to do more .
andrew marr : so your voting power in effect , yeah ?
fu ying : that 's right , that 's right , that 's right .
and we also announced the vice premier wrote an article to the times that we will take an open attitude if the imf is looking for alternative contributions , and maybe if imf issues a bond we 'll see how good it is and we 'll see if we can contribute .
andrew marr : and on the dollar ?
fu ying : and talking about the dollar , there has been a very interesting debate about the reserve currency and the replacement of the reserve currency , and this topic has become very hot on the chinese web at this moment too .
but it has been a long debate in the world .
there is nothing new , there is nothing new .
and china is not calling for a replacement .
it 's an article written by the governor of the central bank on his bank 's website and he 's , i think he 's joining the debate .
and it 's not it 's natural that china is having a debate of this type because we 're experiencing a global crisis we 've never seen .
andrew marr : yes , sure .
fu ying : people are asking questions .
we are trying to understand the situation .
andrew marr : you face of course many questions about human rights in china .
if china is going to become part of this global system and there 's much more transparency in banking and so on , do you accept that it 's going to be impossible and wrong for china to carry on screening newspapers , screening the internet , censoring news from outside ?
that you 're going to have to be part of an open system in every way ?
fu ying : andrew , i have to say that we in china often find it arrogant for the west to think that the human rights development in china has to be taken care of by the west - an assumption that you have a supreme , superior system everybody has to copy from you .
i think that andrew marr : that sounds like a no to me .
is it ambassador ?
fu ying : i think it 's important that we have a equal dialogue on human rights and also acknowledgement , acceptance that china has made huge progress regarding human rights .
and as far as the open society is concerned , china has become a very , very lively , open society , and everybody who has been in china will see it .
andrew marr : ambassador , thank you very much indeed for joining us this morning .
fu ying : thank you .
andrew marr : that was madam fu ying , the chinese ambassador in london .

please note ' the andrew marr show ' must be credited if any part of this transcript is used .
andrew marr : on sunday 29 march andrew marr interviewed her excellency fu ying , chinese ambassador to uk now the chinese president also has n't met president obama , and that 'll be another important meeting at this g20 .
the chinese economy is so vast , some observers have declared that only two countries really matter this week : obama 's america and china .
the economist magazine said it 's not the g20 we should be worried about , it 's the g2 .
well the chinese ambassador to london , madam fu ying , is here with me .
good morning , ambassador fu ying : good morning .
andrew marr : and welcome .
fu ying : thank you .
andrew marr : do you expect there to be a specific deal at the g20 when it comes to a fiscal boost for the world , something that we have n't heard before ?
fu ying : thank you for having me here , andrew .
the london summit is very important .
i 'm sure the countries , the leaders who come here all have an objective to bring the summit a success and they are bound to have an agreement about how they speak in one voice to the world and how to tell the world that they are going to stimulate the economy , they are going to boost the market , they are going to restore the confidence , they 're going to help people in difficult situations and continue to provide aid to the poor countries , for example .
although they may not be able to fix the whole thing in one day , but it 's going to be an important process in the global effort to tackle the crisis .
andrew marr : if there is one country in the world which has still got money , big amounts of money to spend if it chose to , it 's china .
and people have speculated about china deciding to build a western style health service or a welfare system or something really big .
could we see that coming out or being announced at this conference ?
fu ying : i think china , we in china feel very flattered , over flattered -lrb- marr laughs -rrb- when we were given all these big hats of being rich , being wealthy , having huge reserves .
and also there is a misunderstanding of the reserves in china .
the reserves are not the money of the government .
the premier can not write a cheque on it .
it 's the money that the chinese people and the chinese businesses who left in safekeeping of the central bank , and the central bank has to look after them and take good care of them .
and the reserves , the size is big .
but if you remember , there are 1.3 billion people in china and when you divide with that number it comes to a very small number .
it 's about £ 1,000 .
so people should remember that china indeed is still a developing country and our per capita gdp is only 3,000 , although we are number three in the world in aggregate terms .
