the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out . " on the other hand , nolte was surprised by the skepticism that french president francois mitterrand apparently had toward german reunification .
" that 's the biggest revelation from my point of view , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : even francois mitterand , left , harbored misgivings about having a new , unified neighbor wary france the speed with which germany under kohl moved toward reunification seems to have taken europe 's leaders by surprise .
in october 1989 an analysis of the " german question " by the french foreign ministry judged that reunification " does not appear realistic at this moment . " in a letter dated nov .
24 , 1989 from mitterrand to east german leader egon krenz , the french president talked of " perspectives of development in relations with the german democratic republic and the european community . "
four days later kohl introduced his 10-point unification plan to the world . by presenting this program , the normally wary kohl shrewdly seized the initiative both at home , where the opposition social democrats were threatening to steal the issue from him , and abroad .
among the 244 newly released foreign office documents , british ambassador in bonn sir christopher mallaby summed up its significance on the same day . " the key point is that the pressures have reached a level where kohl has felt obliged to make a high profile statement of a policy expressly intended to lead in time to german unity , " he wrote to the british government , " and he has done so on his own authority , not on behalf of the whole coalition , and without prior consultation with the allies … it shows how fast the german question is moving .

the allied military presence in respective sectors gave west berlin the feel of an occupied zone well into the 1980 's .
" western soldiers were customers in shops , in hairdressers .
they were part of everyday life , " reminds nolte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification was not only a domestic problem " it was not just a german problem - something that was split up that had to be reunified - but the whole history of world war ii hung over it .
the international legal situation still had to be cleared up , as the two-plus-four negotiations of 1990 showed , " nolte says .
the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .
" if the people of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic decide freely and democratically in favor of unity , there is no way of stopping that , short of military action , " he told her . the timing of the release of such documents - a full decade before british law required it - shows that the british foreign office apparently felt that its diplomatic reputation needed a little rehabilitation . this is somewhat surprising to roedder .
" the british and the french apparently have a significant need to explain themselves .
i do n't really understand it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i can see that the british and french governments , in a new unified europe , see their own attitudes in a bad light .
it 's also curious that the french are celebrating the 20th anniversary on the champs-élysées .
but the fact that a lot of british and french people were n't exactly overjoyed at the thought of a reunified germany , is completely understandable .
it changed the power balance in europe . " twin fears thatcher had two main fears that were feeding each other in the fraught year between the fall of the berlin wall and reunification - a united germany would be able to strengthen the european community , and a stronger ec would in turn increase germany 's power .
thatcher 's position was in fact not far from the more hysterical right-wing body of opinion in britain , expressed by backbench mps , that germany planned to use the european community to dominate the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how could anyone have been against it ? " while she aired her suspicions publicly , mitterand kept his misgivings private .
the french president was committed to the european project , and in exchange for his blessing for a unified germany , was able to extract from kohl his commitment to european economic and monetary union .
this was exactly what thatcher feared .
" the problems will not be overcome by strengthening the ec .
germany ’ s ambitions would then become the dominant and active factor , " thatcher was quoted as saying in february 1990 . the result was that britain 's diplomacy became crippled in europe and elsewhere .
the german press seized on britain 's perceived negativity and magnified it , until it damaged britain 's relationship with the us , a nation that remained enthusiastic about reunification throughout . the fears of foreign office official sir john fretwell , expressed with some foresight late in 1989 , came true : " if we tried to stand against this tide , we should enter into fundamental political conflict with the federal republic of germany and with many of our allies , including the united states . "
if britain did not begin to convey the impression that it shared the vision of a united europe , he said later , the germans " will be tempted increasingly to move ahead without us on these fundamental issues of european policy . " when thatcher was finally brought down by her own party , in part because of her recalcitrance on european policy , the significance was not lost on those germans .

the allied military presence in respective sectors gave west berlin the feel of an occupied zone well into the 1980 's .
" western soldiers were customers in shops , in hairdressers .
they were part of everyday life , " reminds nolte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification was not only a domestic problem " it was not just a german problem - something that was split up that had to be reunified - but the whole history of world war ii hung over it .
the international legal situation still had to be cleared up , as the two-plus-four negotiations of 1990 showed , " nolte says .
the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .
" if the people of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic decide freely and democratically in favor of unity , there is no way of stopping that , short of military action , " he told her . the timing of the release of such documents - a full decade before british law required it - shows that the british foreign office apparently felt that its diplomatic reputation needed a little rehabilitation . this is somewhat surprising to roedder .
" the british and the french apparently have a significant need to explain themselves .
i do n't really understand it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i can see that the british and french governments , in a new unified europe , see their own attitudes in a bad light .
it 's also curious that the french are celebrating the 20th anniversary on the champs-élysées .
but the fact that a lot of british and french people were n't exactly overjoyed at the thought of a reunified germany , is completely understandable .
it changed the power balance in europe . " twin fears thatcher had two main fears that were feeding each other in the fraught year between the fall of the berlin wall and reunification - a united germany would be able to strengthen the european community , and a stronger ec would in turn increase germany 's power .
thatcher 's position was in fact not far from the more hysterical right-wing body of opinion in britain , expressed by backbench mps , that germany planned to use the european community to dominate the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how could anyone have been against it ? " while she aired her suspicions publicly , mitterand kept his misgivings private .
the french president was committed to the european project , and in exchange for his blessing for a unified germany , was able to extract from kohl his commitment to european economic and monetary union .
this was exactly what thatcher feared .
" the problems will not be overcome by strengthening the ec .
germany ’ s ambitions would then become the dominant and active factor , " thatcher was quoted as saying in february 1990 . the result was that britain 's diplomacy became crippled in europe and elsewhere .
the german press seized on britain 's perceived negativity and magnified it , until it damaged britain 's relationship with the us , a nation that remained enthusiastic about reunification throughout . the fears of foreign office official sir john fretwell , expressed with some foresight late in 1989 , came true : " if we tried to stand against this tide , we should enter into fundamental political conflict with the federal republic of germany and with many of our allies , including the united states . "
if britain did not begin to convey the impression that it shared the vision of a united europe , he said later , the germans " will be tempted increasingly to move ahead without us on these fundamental issues of european policy . " when thatcher was finally brought down by her own party , in part because of her recalcitrance on european policy , the significance was not lost on those germans .

the allied military presence in respective sectors gave west berlin the feel of an occupied zone well into the 1980 's .
" western soldiers were customers in shops , in hairdressers .
they were part of everyday life , " reminds nolte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification was not only a domestic problem " it was not just a german problem - something that was split up that had to be reunified - but the whole history of world war ii hung over it .
the international legal situation still had to be cleared up , as the two-plus-four negotiations of 1990 showed , " nolte says .
the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .
" if the people of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic decide freely and democratically in favor of unity , there is no way of stopping that , short of military action , " he told her . the timing of the release of such documents - a full decade before british law required it - shows that the british foreign office apparently felt that its diplomatic reputation needed a little rehabilitation . this is somewhat surprising to roedder .
" the british and the french apparently have a significant need to explain themselves .
i do n't really understand it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i can see that the british and french governments , in a new unified europe , see their own attitudes in a bad light .
it 's also curious that the french are celebrating the 20th anniversary on the champs-élysées .
but the fact that a lot of british and french people were n't exactly overjoyed at the thought of a reunified germany , is completely understandable .
it changed the power balance in europe . " twin fears thatcher had two main fears that were feeding each other in the fraught year between the fall of the berlin wall and reunification - a united germany would be able to strengthen the european community , and a stronger ec would in turn increase germany 's power .
thatcher 's position was in fact not far from the more hysterical right-wing body of opinion in britain , expressed by backbench mps , that germany planned to use the european community to dominate the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how could anyone have been against it ? " while she aired her suspicions publicly , mitterand kept his misgivings private .
the french president was committed to the european project , and in exchange for his blessing for a unified germany , was able to extract from kohl his commitment to european economic and monetary union .
this was exactly what thatcher feared .
" the problems will not be overcome by strengthening the ec .
germany ’ s ambitions would then become the dominant and active factor , " thatcher was quoted as saying in february 1990 . the result was that britain 's diplomacy became crippled in europe and elsewhere .
the german press seized on britain 's perceived negativity and magnified it , until it damaged britain 's relationship with the us , a nation that remained enthusiastic about reunification throughout . the fears of foreign office official sir john fretwell , expressed with some foresight late in 1989 , came true : " if we tried to stand against this tide , we should enter into fundamental political conflict with the federal republic of germany and with many of our allies , including the united states . "
if britain did not begin to convey the impression that it shared the vision of a united europe , he said later , the germans " will be tempted increasingly to move ahead without us on these fundamental issues of european policy . " when thatcher was finally brought down by her own party , in part because of her recalcitrance on european policy , the significance was not lost on those germans .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out . " on the other hand , nolte was surprised by the skepticism that french president francois mitterrand apparently had toward german reunification .
" that 's the biggest revelation from my point of view , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : even francois mitterand , left , harbored misgivings about having a new , unified neighbor wary france the speed with which germany under kohl moved toward reunification seems to have taken europe 's leaders by surprise .
in october 1989 an analysis of the " german question " by the french foreign ministry judged that reunification " does not appear realistic at this moment . " in a letter dated nov .
24 , 1989 from mitterrand to east german leader egon krenz , the french president talked of " perspectives of development in relations with the german democratic republic and the european community . "
four days later kohl introduced his 10-point unification plan to the world . by presenting this program , the normally wary kohl shrewdly seized the initiative both at home , where the opposition social democrats were threatening to steal the issue from him , and abroad .
among the 244 newly released foreign office documents , british ambassador in bonn sir christopher mallaby summed up its significance on the same day . " the key point is that the pressures have reached a level where kohl has felt obliged to make a high profile statement of a policy expressly intended to lead in time to german unity , " he wrote to the british government , " and he has done so on his own authority , not on behalf of the whole coalition , and without prior consultation with the allies … it shows how fast the german question is moving .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out .

24 , 1989 from mitterrand to east german leader egon krenz , the french president talked of " perspectives of development in relations with the german democratic republic and the european community . "
four days later kohl introduced his 10-point unification plan to the world . by presenting this program , the normally wary kohl shrewdly seized the initiative both at home , where the opposition social democrats were threatening to steal the issue from him , and abroad .

the allied military presence in respective sectors gave west berlin the feel of an occupied zone well into the 1980 's .
" western soldiers were customers in shops , in hairdressers .
they were part of everyday life , " reminds nolte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification was not only a domestic problem " it was not just a german problem - something that was split up that had to be reunified - but the whole history of world war ii hung over it .
the international legal situation still had to be cleared up , as the two-plus-four negotiations of 1990 showed , " nolte says .
the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .
" if the people of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic decide freely and democratically in favor of unity , there is no way of stopping that , short of military action , " he told her . the timing of the release of such documents - a full decade before british law required it - shows that the british foreign office apparently felt that its diplomatic reputation needed a little rehabilitation . this is somewhat surprising to roedder .
" the british and the french apparently have a significant need to explain themselves .
i do n't really understand it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i can see that the british and french governments , in a new unified europe , see their own attitudes in a bad light .
it 's also curious that the french are celebrating the 20th anniversary on the champs-élysées .
but the fact that a lot of british and french people were n't exactly overjoyed at the thought of a reunified germany , is completely understandable .
it changed the power balance in europe . " twin fears thatcher had two main fears that were feeding each other in the fraught year between the fall of the berlin wall and reunification - a united germany would be able to strengthen the european community , and a stronger ec would in turn increase germany 's power .
thatcher 's position was in fact not far from the more hysterical right-wing body of opinion in britain , expressed by backbench mps , that germany planned to use the european community to dominate the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how could anyone have been against it ? " while she aired her suspicions publicly , mitterand kept his misgivings private .
the french president was committed to the european project , and in exchange for his blessing for a unified germany , was able to extract from kohl his commitment to european economic and monetary union .
this was exactly what thatcher feared .
" the problems will not be overcome by strengthening the ec .
germany ’ s ambitions would then become the dominant and active factor , " thatcher was quoted as saying in february 1990 . the result was that britain 's diplomacy became crippled in europe and elsewhere .
the german press seized on britain 's perceived negativity and magnified it , until it damaged britain 's relationship with the us , a nation that remained enthusiastic about reunification throughout . the fears of foreign office official sir john fretwell , expressed with some foresight late in 1989 , came true : " if we tried to stand against this tide , we should enter into fundamental political conflict with the federal republic of germany and with many of our allies , including the united states . "
if britain did not begin to convey the impression that it shared the vision of a united europe , he said later , the germans " will be tempted increasingly to move ahead without us on these fundamental issues of european policy . " when thatcher was finally brought down by her own party , in part because of her recalcitrance on european policy , the significance was not lost on those germans .

germany ’ s ambitions would then become the dominant and active factor , " thatcher was quoted as saying in february 1990 . the result was that britain 's diplomacy became crippled in europe and elsewhere .
the german press seized on britain 's perceived negativity and magnified it , until it damaged britain 's relationship with the us , a nation that remained enthusiastic about reunification throughout . the fears of foreign office official sir john fretwell , expressed with some foresight late in 1989 , came true : " if we tried to stand against this tide , we should enter into fundamental political conflict with the federal republic of germany and with many of our allies , including the united states . "
if britain did not begin to convey the impression that it shared the vision of a united europe , he said later , the germans " will be tempted increasingly to move ahead without us on these fundamental issues of european policy . " when thatcher was finally brought down by her own party , in part because of her recalcitrance on european policy , the significance was not lost on those germans .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out . " on the other hand , nolte was surprised by the skepticism that french president francois mitterrand apparently had toward german reunification .
" that 's the biggest revelation from my point of view , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : even francois mitterand , left , harbored misgivings about having a new , unified neighbor wary france the speed with which germany under kohl moved toward reunification seems to have taken europe 's leaders by surprise .
in october 1989 an analysis of the " german question " by the french foreign ministry judged that reunification " does not appear realistic at this moment . " in a letter dated nov .
24 , 1989 from mitterrand to east german leader egon krenz , the french president talked of " perspectives of development in relations with the german democratic republic and the european community . "
four days later kohl introduced his 10-point unification plan to the world . by presenting this program , the normally wary kohl shrewdly seized the initiative both at home , where the opposition social democrats were threatening to steal the issue from him , and abroad .
among the 244 newly released foreign office documents , british ambassador in bonn sir christopher mallaby summed up its significance on the same day . " the key point is that the pressures have reached a level where kohl has felt obliged to make a high profile statement of a policy expressly intended to lead in time to german unity , " he wrote to the british government , " and he has done so on his own authority , not on behalf of the whole coalition , and without prior consultation with the allies … it shows how fast the german question is moving .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out . " on the other hand , nolte was surprised by the skepticism that french president francois mitterrand apparently had toward german reunification .
" that 's the biggest revelation from my point of view , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : even francois mitterand , left , harbored misgivings about having a new , unified neighbor wary france the speed with which germany under kohl moved toward reunification seems to have taken europe 's leaders by surprise .
in october 1989 an analysis of the " german question " by the french foreign ministry judged that reunification " does not appear realistic at this moment . " in a letter dated nov .
24 , 1989 from mitterrand to east german leader egon krenz , the french president talked of " perspectives of development in relations with the german democratic republic and the european community . "
four days later kohl introduced his 10-point unification plan to the world . by presenting this program , the normally wary kohl shrewdly seized the initiative both at home , where the opposition social democrats were threatening to steal the issue from him , and abroad .
among the 244 newly released foreign office documents , british ambassador in bonn sir christopher mallaby summed up its significance on the same day . " the key point is that the pressures have reached a level where kohl has felt obliged to make a high profile statement of a policy expressly intended to lead in time to german unity , " he wrote to the british government , " and he has done so on his own authority , not on behalf of the whole coalition , and without prior consultation with the allies … it shows how fast the german question is moving .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .

the allied military presence in respective sectors gave west berlin the feel of an occupied zone well into the 1980 's .
" western soldiers were customers in shops , in hairdressers .
they were part of everyday life , " reminds nolte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification was not only a domestic problem " it was not just a german problem - something that was split up that had to be reunified - but the whole history of world war ii hung over it .
the international legal situation still had to be cleared up , as the two-plus-four negotiations of 1990 showed , " nolte says .
the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .
" if the people of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic decide freely and democratically in favor of unity , there is no way of stopping that , short of military action , " he told her . the timing of the release of such documents - a full decade before british law required it - shows that the british foreign office apparently felt that its diplomatic reputation needed a little rehabilitation . this is somewhat surprising to roedder .
" the british and the french apparently have a significant need to explain themselves .
i do n't really understand it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i can see that the british and french governments , in a new unified europe , see their own attitudes in a bad light .
it 's also curious that the french are celebrating the 20th anniversary on the champs-élysées .
but the fact that a lot of british and french people were n't exactly overjoyed at the thought of a reunified germany , is completely understandable .
it changed the power balance in europe . " twin fears thatcher had two main fears that were feeding each other in the fraught year between the fall of the berlin wall and reunification - a united germany would be able to strengthen the european community , and a stronger ec would in turn increase germany 's power .
thatcher 's position was in fact not far from the more hysterical right-wing body of opinion in britain , expressed by backbench mps , that germany planned to use the european community to dominate the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how could anyone have been against it ? " while she aired her suspicions publicly , mitterand kept his misgivings private .
the french president was committed to the european project , and in exchange for his blessing for a unified germany , was able to extract from kohl his commitment to european economic and monetary union .
this was exactly what thatcher feared .
" the problems will not be overcome by strengthening the ec .
germany ’ s ambitions would then become the dominant and active factor , " thatcher was quoted as saying in february 1990 . the result was that britain 's diplomacy became crippled in europe and elsewhere .
the german press seized on britain 's perceived negativity and magnified it , until it damaged britain 's relationship with the us , a nation that remained enthusiastic about reunification throughout . the fears of foreign office official sir john fretwell , expressed with some foresight late in 1989 , came true : " if we tried to stand against this tide , we should enter into fundamental political conflict with the federal republic of germany and with many of our allies , including the united states . "
if britain did not begin to convey the impression that it shared the vision of a united europe , he said later , the germans " will be tempted increasingly to move ahead without us on these fundamental issues of european policy . " when thatcher was finally brought down by her own party , in part because of her recalcitrance on european policy , the significance was not lost on those germans .

" western soldiers were customers in shops , in hairdressers .

the international legal situation still had to be cleared up , as the two-plus-four negotiations of 1990 showed , " nolte says .
the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out . " on the other hand , nolte was surprised by the skepticism that french president francois mitterrand apparently had toward german reunification .
" that 's the biggest revelation from my point of view , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : even francois mitterand , left , harbored misgivings about having a new , unified neighbor wary france the speed with which germany under kohl moved toward reunification seems to have taken europe 's leaders by surprise .
in october 1989 an analysis of the " german question " by the french foreign ministry judged that reunification " does not appear realistic at this moment . " in a letter dated nov .
24 , 1989 from mitterrand to east german leader egon krenz , the french president talked of " perspectives of development in relations with the german democratic republic and the european community . "
four days later kohl introduced his 10-point unification plan to the world . by presenting this program , the normally wary kohl shrewdly seized the initiative both at home , where the opposition social democrats were threatening to steal the issue from him , and abroad .
among the 244 newly released foreign office documents , british ambassador in bonn sir christopher mallaby summed up its significance on the same day . " the key point is that the pressures have reached a level where kohl has felt obliged to make a high profile statement of a policy expressly intended to lead in time to german unity , " he wrote to the british government , " and he has done so on his own authority , not on behalf of the whole coalition , and without prior consultation with the allies … it shows how fast the german question is moving . "
in response , thatcher remarked , " christopher mallaby seems to welcome reunification . " read more about the allies ' concerns 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 , 1989 gdr central committee spokesman guenter schabowski unintentionally announced that citizens could travel to west germany immediately .
it was the beginning of the end for east germany . guenter schabowski 's press conference on november 9 , 1989 was a fairly dull affair for most of its duration , according to those present .
but a question by an italian journalist right at the end turned it into one of european history 's most memorable events .
schabowski was asked just before 7 p.m. about when a new law permitting gdr citizens more freedom of travel would go into effect .
schabowski famously told the journalist : " as far as i know , that goes into effect now , immediately . "
since television viewers in both east and west germany were following the live press conference , his comments electrified east germans and eventually led to a redrawing of the european map .
immediately following the remark , gdr citizens rushed to the border separating east and west berlin , wanting to visit the western part of the city .
the gdr border guards were unaware of the press conference , and , taken aback by the crowds gathering in front of them , made repeated calls to their superiors asking for guidance .
they successfully prevented citizens from crossing the border for three hours .
but later in the evening , the guards relented and opened the borders .
people were able to cross freely from east to west for the first time since the wall was erected on august 21 , 1961 .
" we are the people ! "
in the months prior to schabowski 's press conference , thousands of gdr citizens had taken to the streets demanding political reform .
the so-called " monday demonstrators " in the eastern city of leipzig had drawn special attention for their protests .
shouts by demonstrators of " we are the people ! " became commonplace , followed by " gorbi !
gorbi ! " – calls directed at mikhail gorbachev , the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union .
since 1985 , gorbachev had been implementing reforms in his country , and germans living in the gdr hoped to see his ideas adopted there as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70,000 protestors took to the streets on october 9 , 1989 in leipzig however , the hardline government under gdr leader erich honecker was not interested in reform , and the government 's refusal to change ultimately led to its own demise .
on october 18 , 1989 , honecker was forced to step down .
he was replaced by egon krenz as head of state , but even this shift could not prevent the gdr 's collapse .
a november 4 protest at berlin 's alexanderplatz attracted 500,000 people , making it clear that a change of leadership would not win the people 's trust .
when the berlin wall opened five days later , demands for reunification of east and west germany grew louder .
german unity and european integration in light of the increasing support for reunification , western diplomats travelled to the gdr a few weeks after the wall 's opening .
france and england in particular reacted with mistrust to the prospect of the large and economically powerful german state that reunification would create in the heart of europe .
if they could not stop reunification entirely , the two countries at least hoped to apply political sanctions on germany .
helmut kohl , then-chancellor of germany , kept their position in mind as he delivered a speech in front of the ruins of dresden 's " frauenkirche " cathedral that drew worldwide attention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and francois mitterrand negotiated on the future of the gdr kohl declared that german unity would only be possible in the context of a more unified europe generally .
he said german and european unification were just two sides of the same coin .
his speech garnered thunderous applause from the gdr citizens in attendance .
nevertheless , french president francois mitterrand travelled to the gdr two days later in an attempt to prevent west germany from annexing the east .
by early 1990 , the international community watched closely the process of german reunification to ensure that the interests of germans as well as of the four conquering allied powers from world war ii -lrb- england , france , the us and the soviet union -rrb- were respected .
german negotiators worked out the conditions of a german reunification internally , while both west and east german officials consulted with the four powers about the international ramifications of their proposal .
this so-called " 2 plus 4 " process -lrb- representing the two german states and the four allied powers -rrb- concluded with a declaration of sovereignty for germany on september 12 , 1990 .
german negotiations had already resulted in a contract that specified all aspects of the new relationship between east and west germany on august 31 , 1990 .
on october 3 , 1990 , the former east german states officially joined the federal republic of germany .
the date marked the end of the gdr and the beginning of a reunified federal republic .

9 , 1989 gdr central committee spokesman guenter schabowski unintentionally announced that citizens could travel to west germany immediately .
it was the beginning of the end for east germany . guenter schabowski 's press conference on november 9 , 1989 was a fairly dull affair for most of its duration , according to those present .
but a question by an italian journalist right at the end turned it into one of european history 's most memorable events .
schabowski was asked just before 7 p.m. about when a new law permitting gdr citizens more freedom of travel would go into effect .
schabowski famously told the journalist : " as far as i know , that goes into effect now , immediately . "
since television viewers in both east and west germany were following the live press conference , his comments electrified east germans and eventually led to a redrawing of the european map .
immediately following the remark , gdr citizens rushed to the border separating east and west berlin , wanting to visit the western part of the city .
the gdr border guards were unaware of the press conference , and , taken aback by the crowds gathering in front of them , made repeated calls to their superiors asking for guidance .
they successfully prevented citizens from crossing the border for three hours .
but later in the evening , the guards relented and opened the borders .
people were able to cross freely from east to west for the first time since the wall was erected on august 21 , 1961 .
" we are the people ! "
in the months prior to schabowski 's press conference , thousands of gdr citizens had taken to the streets demanding political reform .
the so-called " monday demonstrators " in the eastern city of leipzig had drawn special attention for their protests .
shouts by demonstrators of " we are the people ! " became commonplace , followed by " gorbi !
gorbi ! " – calls directed at mikhail gorbachev , the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union .
since 1985 , gorbachev had been implementing reforms in his country , and germans living in the gdr hoped to see his ideas adopted there as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70,000 protestors took to the streets on october 9 , 1989 in leipzig however , the hardline government under gdr leader erich honecker was not interested in reform , and the government 's refusal to change ultimately led to its own demise .
on october 18 , 1989 , honecker was forced to step down .
he was replaced by egon krenz as head of state , but even this shift could not prevent the gdr 's collapse .
a november 4 protest at berlin 's alexanderplatz attracted 500,000 people , making it clear that a change of leadership would not win the people 's trust .
when the berlin wall opened five days later , demands for reunification of east and west germany grew louder .
german unity and european integration in light of the increasing support for reunification , western diplomats travelled to the gdr a few weeks after the wall 's opening .
france and england in particular reacted with mistrust to the prospect of the large and economically powerful german state that reunification would create in the heart of europe .
if they could not stop reunification entirely , the two countries at least hoped to apply political sanctions on germany .
helmut kohl , then-chancellor of germany , kept their position in mind as he delivered a speech in front of the ruins of dresden 's " frauenkirche " cathedral that drew worldwide attention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and francois mitterrand negotiated on the future of the gdr kohl declared that german unity would only be possible in the context of a more unified europe generally .
he said german and european unification were just two sides of the same coin .
his speech garnered thunderous applause from the gdr citizens in attendance .
nevertheless , french president francois mitterrand travelled to the gdr two days later in an attempt to prevent west germany from annexing the east .
by early 1990 , the international community watched closely the process of german reunification to ensure that the interests of germans as well as of the four conquering allied powers from world war ii -lrb- england , france , the us and the soviet union -rrb- were respected .
german negotiators worked out the conditions of a german reunification internally , while both west and east german officials consulted with the four powers about the international ramifications of their proposal .
this so-called " 2 plus 4 " process -lrb- representing the two german states and the four allied powers -rrb- concluded with a declaration of sovereignty for germany on september 12 , 1990 .
german negotiations had already resulted in a contract that specified all aspects of the new relationship between east and west germany on august 31 , 1990 .
on october 3 , 1990 , the former east german states officially joined the federal republic of germany .
the date marked the end of the gdr and the beginning of a reunified federal republic .

9 , 1989 gdr central committee spokesman guenter schabowski unintentionally announced that citizens could travel to west germany immediately .
it was the beginning of the end for east germany . guenter schabowski 's press conference on november 9 , 1989 was a fairly dull affair for most of its duration , according to those present .
but a question by an italian journalist right at the end turned it into one of european history 's most memorable events .
schabowski was asked just before 7 p.m. about when a new law permitting gdr citizens more freedom of travel would go into effect .
schabowski famously told the journalist : " as far as i know , that goes into effect now , immediately . "
since television viewers in both east and west germany were following the live press conference , his comments electrified east germans and eventually led to a redrawing of the european map .
immediately following the remark , gdr citizens rushed to the border separating east and west berlin , wanting to visit the western part of the city .
the gdr border guards were unaware of the press conference , and , taken aback by the crowds gathering in front of them , made repeated calls to their superiors asking for guidance .
they successfully prevented citizens from crossing the border for three hours .
but later in the evening , the guards relented and opened the borders .
people were able to cross freely from east to west for the first time since the wall was erected on august 21 , 1961 .
" we are the people ! "
in the months prior to schabowski 's press conference , thousands of gdr citizens had taken to the streets demanding political reform .
the so-called " monday demonstrators " in the eastern city of leipzig had drawn special attention for their protests .
shouts by demonstrators of " we are the people ! " became commonplace , followed by " gorbi !
gorbi ! " – calls directed at mikhail gorbachev , the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union .
since 1985 , gorbachev had been implementing reforms in his country , and germans living in the gdr hoped to see his ideas adopted there as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70,000 protestors took to the streets on october 9 , 1989 in leipzig however , the hardline government under gdr leader erich honecker was not interested in reform , and the government 's refusal to change ultimately led to its own demise .
on october 18 , 1989 , honecker was forced to step down .
he was replaced by egon krenz as head of state , but even this shift could not prevent the gdr 's collapse .
a november 4 protest at berlin 's alexanderplatz attracted 500,000 people , making it clear that a change of leadership would not win the people 's trust .
when the berlin wall opened five days later , demands for reunification of east and west germany grew louder .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .

the allied military presence in respective sectors gave west berlin the feel of an occupied zone well into the 1980 's .
" western soldiers were customers in shops , in hairdressers .
they were part of everyday life , " reminds nolte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification was not only a domestic problem " it was not just a german problem - something that was split up that had to be reunified - but the whole history of world war ii hung over it .
the international legal situation still had to be cleared up , as the two-plus-four negotiations of 1990 showed , " nolte says .
the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .
" if the people of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic decide freely and democratically in favor of unity , there is no way of stopping that , short of military action , " he told her . the timing of the release of such documents - a full decade before british law required it - shows that the british foreign office apparently felt that its diplomatic reputation needed a little rehabilitation . this is somewhat surprising to roedder .
" the british and the french apparently have a significant need to explain themselves .
i do n't really understand it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i can see that the british and french governments , in a new unified europe , see their own attitudes in a bad light .
it 's also curious that the french are celebrating the 20th anniversary on the champs-élysées .
but the fact that a lot of british and french people were n't exactly overjoyed at the thought of a reunified germany , is completely understandable .
it changed the power balance in europe . " twin fears thatcher had two main fears that were feeding each other in the fraught year between the fall of the berlin wall and reunification - a united germany would be able to strengthen the european community , and a stronger ec would in turn increase germany 's power .
thatcher 's position was in fact not far from the more hysterical right-wing body of opinion in britain , expressed by backbench mps , that germany planned to use the european community to dominate the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how could anyone have been against it ? " while she aired her suspicions publicly , mitterand kept his misgivings private .
the french president was committed to the european project , and in exchange for his blessing for a unified germany , was able to extract from kohl his commitment to european economic and monetary union .
this was exactly what thatcher feared .
" the problems will not be overcome by strengthening the ec .
germany ’ s ambitions would then become the dominant and active factor , " thatcher was quoted as saying in february 1990 . the result was that britain 's diplomacy became crippled in europe and elsewhere .
the german press seized on britain 's perceived negativity and magnified it , until it damaged britain 's relationship with the us , a nation that remained enthusiastic about reunification throughout . the fears of foreign office official sir john fretwell , expressed with some foresight late in 1989 , came true : " if we tried to stand against this tide , we should enter into fundamental political conflict with the federal republic of germany and with many of our allies , including the united states . "
if britain did not begin to convey the impression that it shared the vision of a united europe , he said later , the germans " will be tempted increasingly to move ahead without us on these fundamental issues of european policy . " when thatcher was finally brought down by her own party , in part because of her recalcitrance on european policy , the significance was not lost on those germans .

the allied military presence in respective sectors gave west berlin the feel of an occupied zone well into the 1980 's .
" western soldiers were customers in shops , in hairdressers .
they were part of everyday life , " reminds nolte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification was not only a domestic problem " it was not just a german problem - something that was split up that had to be reunified - but the whole history of world war ii hung over it .
the international legal situation still had to be cleared up , as the two-plus-four negotiations of 1990 showed , " nolte says .
the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .
" if the people of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic decide freely and democratically in favor of unity , there is no way of stopping that , short of military action , " he told her . the timing of the release of such documents - a full decade before british law required it - shows that the british foreign office apparently felt that its diplomatic reputation needed a little rehabilitation . this is somewhat surprising to roedder .

" i can see that the british and french governments , in a new unified europe , see their own attitudes in a bad light .

the allied military presence in respective sectors gave west berlin the feel of an occupied zone well into the 1980 's .
" western soldiers were customers in shops , in hairdressers .
they were part of everyday life , " reminds nolte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification was not only a domestic problem " it was not just a german problem - something that was split up that had to be reunified - but the whole history of world war ii hung over it .
the international legal situation still had to be cleared up , as the two-plus-four negotiations of 1990 showed , " nolte says .
the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .
" if the people of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic decide freely and democratically in favor of unity , there is no way of stopping that , short of military action , " he told her . the timing of the release of such documents - a full decade before british law required it - shows that the british foreign office apparently felt that its diplomatic reputation needed a little rehabilitation . this is somewhat surprising to roedder .
" the british and the french apparently have a significant need to explain themselves .
i do n't really understand it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i can see that the british and french governments , in a new unified europe , see their own attitudes in a bad light .
it 's also curious that the french are celebrating the 20th anniversary on the champs-élysées .
but the fact that a lot of british and french people were n't exactly overjoyed at the thought of a reunified germany , is completely understandable .
it changed the power balance in europe . " twin fears thatcher had two main fears that were feeding each other in the fraught year between the fall of the berlin wall and reunification - a united germany would be able to strengthen the european community , and a stronger ec would in turn increase germany 's power .
thatcher 's position was in fact not far from the more hysterical right-wing body of opinion in britain , expressed by backbench mps , that germany planned to use the european community to dominate the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how could anyone have been against it ? " while she aired her suspicions publicly , mitterand kept his misgivings private .
the french president was committed to the european project , and in exchange for his blessing for a unified germany , was able to extract from kohl his commitment to european economic and monetary union .
this was exactly what thatcher feared .
" the problems will not be overcome by strengthening the ec .
germany ’ s ambitions would then become the dominant and active factor , " thatcher was quoted as saying in february 1990 . the result was that britain 's diplomacy became crippled in europe and elsewhere .
the german press seized on britain 's perceived negativity and magnified it , until it damaged britain 's relationship with the us , a nation that remained enthusiastic about reunification throughout . the fears of foreign office official sir john fretwell , expressed with some foresight late in 1989 , came true : " if we tried to stand against this tide , we should enter into fundamental political conflict with the federal republic of germany and with many of our allies , including the united states . "
if britain did not begin to convey the impression that it shared the vision of a united europe , he said later , the germans " will be tempted increasingly to move ahead without us on these fundamental issues of european policy . " when thatcher was finally brought down by her own party , in part because of her recalcitrance on european policy , the significance was not lost on those germans .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out . " on the other hand , nolte was surprised by the skepticism that french president francois mitterrand apparently had toward german reunification .
" that 's the biggest revelation from my point of view , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : even francois mitterand , left , harbored misgivings about having a new , unified neighbor wary france the speed with which germany under kohl moved toward reunification seems to have taken europe 's leaders by surprise .
in october 1989 an analysis of the " german question " by the french foreign ministry judged that reunification " does not appear realistic at this moment . " in a letter dated nov .
24 , 1989 from mitterrand to east german leader egon krenz , the french president talked of " perspectives of development in relations with the german democratic republic and the european community . "
four days later kohl introduced his 10-point unification plan to the world . by presenting this program , the normally wary kohl shrewdly seized the initiative both at home , where the opposition social democrats were threatening to steal the issue from him , and abroad .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .

he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out . " on the other hand , nolte was surprised by the skepticism that french president francois mitterrand apparently had toward german reunification .

four days later kohl introduced his 10-point unification plan to the world . by presenting this program , the normally wary kohl shrewdly seized the initiative both at home , where the opposition social democrats were threatening to steal the issue from him , and abroad .

9 , 1989 gdr central committee spokesman guenter schabowski unintentionally announced that citizens could travel to west germany immediately .
it was the beginning of the end for east germany . guenter schabowski 's press conference on november 9 , 1989 was a fairly dull affair for most of its duration , according to those present .
but a question by an italian journalist right at the end turned it into one of european history 's most memorable events .
schabowski was asked just before 7 p.m. about when a new law permitting gdr citizens more freedom of travel would go into effect .
schabowski famously told the journalist : " as far as i know , that goes into effect now , immediately . "
since television viewers in both east and west germany were following the live press conference , his comments electrified east germans and eventually led to a redrawing of the european map .
immediately following the remark , gdr citizens rushed to the border separating east and west berlin , wanting to visit the western part of the city .
the gdr border guards were unaware of the press conference , and , taken aback by the crowds gathering in front of them , made repeated calls to their superiors asking for guidance .
they successfully prevented citizens from crossing the border for three hours .
but later in the evening , the guards relented and opened the borders .
people were able to cross freely from east to west for the first time since the wall was erected on august 21 , 1961 .
" we are the people ! "
in the months prior to schabowski 's press conference , thousands of gdr citizens had taken to the streets demanding political reform .
the so-called " monday demonstrators " in the eastern city of leipzig had drawn special attention for their protests .
shouts by demonstrators of " we are the people ! " became commonplace , followed by " gorbi !
gorbi ! " – calls directed at mikhail gorbachev , the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union .
since 1985 , gorbachev had been implementing reforms in his country , and germans living in the gdr hoped to see his ideas adopted there as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70,000 protestors took to the streets on october 9 , 1989 in leipzig however , the hardline government under gdr leader erich honecker was not interested in reform , and the government 's refusal to change ultimately led to its own demise .
on october 18 , 1989 , honecker was forced to step down .
he was replaced by egon krenz as head of state , but even this shift could not prevent the gdr 's collapse .
a november 4 protest at berlin 's alexanderplatz attracted 500,000 people , making it clear that a change of leadership would not win the people 's trust .
when the berlin wall opened five days later , demands for reunification of east and west germany grew louder .
german unity and european integration in light of the increasing support for reunification , western diplomats travelled to the gdr a few weeks after the wall 's opening .
france and england in particular reacted with mistrust to the prospect of the large and economically powerful german state that reunification would create in the heart of europe .
if they could not stop reunification entirely , the two countries at least hoped to apply political sanctions on germany .
helmut kohl , then-chancellor of germany , kept their position in mind as he delivered a speech in front of the ruins of dresden 's " frauenkirche " cathedral that drew worldwide attention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and francois mitterrand negotiated on the future of the gdr kohl declared that german unity would only be possible in the context of a more unified europe generally .
he said german and european unification were just two sides of the same coin .
his speech garnered thunderous applause from the gdr citizens in attendance .
nevertheless , french president francois mitterrand travelled to the gdr two days later in an attempt to prevent west germany from annexing the east .
by early 1990 , the international community watched closely the process of german reunification to ensure that the interests of germans as well as of the four conquering allied powers from world war ii -lrb- england , france , the us and the soviet union -rrb- were respected .
german negotiators worked out the conditions of a german reunification internally , while both west and east german officials consulted with the four powers about the international ramifications of their proposal .
this so-called " 2 plus 4 " process -lrb- representing the two german states and the four allied powers -rrb- concluded with a declaration of sovereignty for germany on september 12 , 1990 .
german negotiations had already resulted in a contract that specified all aspects of the new relationship between east and west germany on august 31 , 1990 .
on october 3 , 1990 , the former east german states officially joined the federal republic of germany .
the date marked the end of the gdr and the beginning of a reunified federal republic .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and francois mitterrand negotiated on the future of the gdr kohl declared that german unity would only be possible in the context of a more unified europe generally .
he said german and european unification were just two sides of the same coin .
his speech garnered thunderous applause from the gdr citizens in attendance .
nevertheless , french president francois mitterrand travelled to the gdr two days later in an attempt to prevent west germany from annexing the east .
by early 1990 , the international community watched closely the process of german reunification to ensure that the interests of germans as well as of the four conquering allied powers from world war ii -lrb- england , france , the us and the soviet union -rrb- were respected .
german negotiators worked out the conditions of a german reunification internally , while both west and east german officials consulted with the four powers about the international ramifications of their proposal .
this so-called " 2 plus 4 " process -lrb- representing the two german states and the four allied powers -rrb- concluded with a declaration of sovereignty for germany on september 12 , 1990 .
german negotiations had already resulted in a contract that specified all aspects of the new relationship between east and west germany on august 31 , 1990 .
on october 3 , 1990 , the former east german states officially joined the federal republic of germany .
the date marked the end of the gdr and the beginning of a reunified federal republic .

9 , 1989 gdr central committee spokesman guenter schabowski unintentionally announced that citizens could travel to west germany immediately .
it was the beginning of the end for east germany . guenter schabowski 's press conference on november 9 , 1989 was a fairly dull affair for most of its duration , according to those present .
but a question by an italian journalist right at the end turned it into one of european history 's most memorable events .
schabowski was asked just before 7 p.m. about when a new law permitting gdr citizens more freedom of travel would go into effect .
schabowski famously told the journalist : " as far as i know , that goes into effect now , immediately . "
since television viewers in both east and west germany were following the live press conference , his comments electrified east germans and eventually led to a redrawing of the european map .
immediately following the remark , gdr citizens rushed to the border separating east and west berlin , wanting to visit the western part of the city .
the gdr border guards were unaware of the press conference , and , taken aback by the crowds gathering in front of them , made repeated calls to their superiors asking for guidance .
they successfully prevented citizens from crossing the border for three hours .
but later in the evening , the guards relented and opened the borders .
people were able to cross freely from east to west for the first time since the wall was erected on august 21 , 1961 .
" we are the people ! "
in the months prior to schabowski 's press conference , thousands of gdr citizens had taken to the streets demanding political reform .
the so-called " monday demonstrators " in the eastern city of leipzig had drawn special attention for their protests .
shouts by demonstrators of " we are the people ! " became commonplace , followed by " gorbi !
gorbi ! " – calls directed at mikhail gorbachev , the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union .
since 1985 , gorbachev had been implementing reforms in his country , and germans living in the gdr hoped to see his ideas adopted there as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70,000 protestors took to the streets on october 9 , 1989 in leipzig however , the hardline government under gdr leader erich honecker was not interested in reform , and the government 's refusal to change ultimately led to its own demise .
on october 18 , 1989 , honecker was forced to step down .
he was replaced by egon krenz as head of state , but even this shift could not prevent the gdr 's collapse .
a november 4 protest at berlin 's alexanderplatz attracted 500,000 people , making it clear that a change of leadership would not win the people 's trust .
when the berlin wall opened five days later , demands for reunification of east and west germany grew louder .
german unity and european integration in light of the increasing support for reunification , western diplomats travelled to the gdr a few weeks after the wall 's opening .
france and england in particular reacted with mistrust to the prospect of the large and economically powerful german state that reunification would create in the heart of europe .
if they could not stop reunification entirely , the two countries at least hoped to apply political sanctions on germany .
helmut kohl , then-chancellor of germany , kept their position in mind as he delivered a speech in front of the ruins of dresden 's " frauenkirche " cathedral that drew worldwide attention .

9 , 1989 gdr central committee spokesman guenter schabowski unintentionally announced that citizens could travel to west germany immediately .
it was the beginning of the end for east germany . guenter schabowski 's press conference on november 9 , 1989 was a fairly dull affair for most of its duration , according to those present .
but a question by an italian journalist right at the end turned it into one of european history 's most memorable events .
schabowski was asked just before 7 p.m. about when a new law permitting gdr citizens more freedom of travel would go into effect .
schabowski famously told the journalist : " as far as i know , that goes into effect now , immediately . "
since television viewers in both east and west germany were following the live press conference , his comments electrified east germans and eventually led to a redrawing of the european map .
immediately following the remark , gdr citizens rushed to the border separating east and west berlin , wanting to visit the western part of the city .
the gdr border guards were unaware of the press conference , and , taken aback by the crowds gathering in front of them , made repeated calls to their superiors asking for guidance .
they successfully prevented citizens from crossing the border for three hours .
but later in the evening , the guards relented and opened the borders .
people were able to cross freely from east to west for the first time since the wall was erected on august 21 , 1961 .
" we are the people ! "
in the months prior to schabowski 's press conference , thousands of gdr citizens had taken to the streets demanding political reform .
the so-called " monday demonstrators " in the eastern city of leipzig had drawn special attention for their protests .
shouts by demonstrators of " we are the people ! " became commonplace , followed by " gorbi !
gorbi ! " – calls directed at mikhail gorbachev , the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union .
since 1985 , gorbachev had been implementing reforms in his country , and germans living in the gdr hoped to see his ideas adopted there as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70,000 protestors took to the streets on october 9 , 1989 in leipzig however , the hardline government under gdr leader erich honecker was not interested in reform , and the government 's refusal to change ultimately led to its own demise .
on october 18 , 1989 , honecker was forced to step down .
he was replaced by egon krenz as head of state , but even this shift could not prevent the gdr 's collapse .
a november 4 protest at berlin 's alexanderplatz attracted 500,000 people , making it clear that a change of leadership would not win the people 's trust .
when the berlin wall opened five days later , demands for reunification of east and west germany grew louder .
german unity and european integration in light of the increasing support for reunification , western diplomats travelled to the gdr a few weeks after the wall 's opening .
france and england in particular reacted with mistrust to the prospect of the large and economically powerful german state that reunification would create in the heart of europe .
if they could not stop reunification entirely , the two countries at least hoped to apply political sanctions on germany .
helmut kohl , then-chancellor of germany , kept their position in mind as he delivered a speech in front of the ruins of dresden 's " frauenkirche " cathedral that drew worldwide attention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and francois mitterrand negotiated on the future of the gdr kohl declared that german unity would only be possible in the context of a more unified europe generally .
he said german and european unification were just two sides of the same coin .
his speech garnered thunderous applause from the gdr citizens in attendance .
nevertheless , french president francois mitterrand travelled to the gdr two days later in an attempt to prevent west germany from annexing the east .
by early 1990 , the international community watched closely the process of german reunification to ensure that the interests of germans as well as of the four conquering allied powers from world war ii -lrb- england , france , the us and the soviet union -rrb- were respected .
german negotiators worked out the conditions of a german reunification internally , while both west and east german officials consulted with the four powers about the international ramifications of their proposal .
this so-called " 2 plus 4 " process -lrb- representing the two german states and the four allied powers -rrb- concluded with a declaration of sovereignty for germany on september 12 , 1990 .
german negotiations had already resulted in a contract that specified all aspects of the new relationship between east and west germany on august 31 , 1990 .
on october 3 , 1990 , the former east german states officially joined the federal republic of germany .
the date marked the end of the gdr and the beginning of a reunified federal republic .

" the national government wants this to succeed , " niebel told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday .

niebel noted that even some sort of resolution outlining core goals for an international accord could be considered a success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel is worried that a new accord to replace the kyoto protocol may not be found climate protection gets expensive the climate summit in copenhagen is supposed to come up with a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
however , industrial and developing nations continue to argue over which countries must reduce their emissions and who should bear the costs of carbon dioxide reduction measures .
according to eu estimates , the earth 's poorest nations will need about 100 billion euros per year until 2020 .
about 22 to 50 billion euros of that will come from the public purse .
the eu has indicated that it is prepared to cover about a third of the costs .
but an agreement among all the industrialized countries is still pending .
" if there is n't an agreement on financing , if there is n't an agreement about contributions to make sure we can deal with this problem , then the copenhagen agreement is going to be much , much more difficult , " british finance minister alistair darling said on saturday , after finance ministers from the g20 countries met in st. andrews , scotland .

at 3:00 p.m. local time , german chancellor angela merkel , together with former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and ex-polish president lech walesa , took a symbolic stroll across a bridge at bornholmer strasse - a former checkpoint along the berlin wall .
it was the first border crossing to be opened in the city , and merkel , who grew up in east germany , was among those east berliners who surged into the west on the evening of november 9 , 1989 .
in a speech , she honored all those who became victims of the east german regime , and also offered thanks to those who supported east germans in their struggle to live in a free society .
she also praised gorbachev for his role in reforming the soviet union .
" you made this possible , you courageously let things happen , and that was much more than we could expect , " she told gorbachev .
her words came ahead of the main ceremonies which will be held at the brandenburg gate .
there , the chancellor will be joined by russian president dmitri medvedev , us secretary of state hillary clinton and the leaders of all 27 european union member states , including french president nicolas sarkozy and british prime minister gordon brown .
dominos a powerful symbol one of the highlights will be the toppling of 1,000 colorful styrofoam dominos , which have been lined up along a 1.5 kilometer -lrb- one mile -rrb- stretch of terrain once occupied by the berlin wall in the area around the brandenburg gate and the reichstag parliament building .
the falling of the 2.5-meter-high -lrb- 8 ft .
2 in . -rrb- dominos will symbolically mark the fall of the wall .
they have been decorated by various artists as well as berlin school children to reflect upon what reunification represents to the people of east and west germany .
many of the dominos carry messages like " we are one people . "
one labeled " bleeding heart " shows a sword cutting through the city of berlin , starting a crimson flow of blood speckled with crosses .
bildunterschrift : artists , students and school children decorated the dominos symbolizing the fall of the wall " everyone has walls in their heads to a certain extent , " said one berlin resident stefan schueler , who was admiring the artwork .
" it is always a good thing if one can break them down , and i think this is a good symbol . "
" it 's really very beautiful , it 's a terrific idea , " said barbara graff , a 74-year-old city resident .
recalling november 9 , 1989 , she said that she went to west berlin 's main shopping street , kurfuerstendamm , and " distributed money to the people arriving en masse from the east . "
human chain to form in addition to the toppling of the dominos , the celebrations include a fireworks display , concerts and a human chain linking thousands of germans and foreigners together along the former path of the wall .
the president of the berlin assembly , walter momper , on saturday donated the first of many stone pillars to be erected in the city 's berlin wall park to remember those killed while trying to escape communist east germany .
over the next few years , more pillars will be added until all the 136 victims shot and killed between 1961 and 1989 have been commemorated .

in a speech , she honored all those who became victims of the east german regime , and also offered thanks to those who supported east germans in their struggle to live in a free society .

" it is always a good thing if one can break them down , and i think this is a good symbol . "
" it 's really very beautiful , it 's a terrific idea , " said barbara graff , a 74-year-old city resident .
recalling november 9 , 1989 , she said that she went to west berlin 's main shopping street , kurfuerstendamm , and " distributed money to the people arriving en masse from the east . "

" in the last two decades , we have neglected to invest in roads and rail " in the west , ramsauer told the newspaper , referring to the reunification of east and west germany 20 years ago .
" now the time has come to make up for what we have failed to do , " he added .
he said there was a " considerable backlog " of important construction projects in western germany .
ramsauer said thanks to a 5.5 percent solidarity tax on german taxpayers and hundreds of billions of euros in state funding , roads and other infrastructure in the former east germany were no longer in disrepair but had instead been transformed into some of the finest in the world .
the transport minister added that this progress was sometimes achieved at the cost of infrastructure in western germany .
ramsauer ’ s comments have drawn negative reactions from some other members of the governing coalition , especially as they came amid celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the wall tumbling and national unification .
cornelia pieper , deputy chairman of the free democrats – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative bloc – criticized ramsauer ’ s comments as a " tasteless contribution . "
she was quoted as telling the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper that the minister had made the comments " in complete disregard for reality and has unnecessarily disturbed this day of joy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minister has called for stepping up investment in infrastructure in the west ‘ 1.3 trillion euros transferred to former east germany ’ a new study out on sunday showed that reunited germany transferred some 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 trillion -rrb- to prop up the former communist east in the years following the berlin wall 's fall .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- said the huge sum spent between 1991 and 2005 , had largely gone toward social welfare payments for easterners .
iwh president ulrich blum said only about 10 percent of the subsidies had gone to measures intended to spur economic growth while about 67 percent went towards social welfare benefits .
" the fact that the transfers increased rather than decreased in the last few years shocked us , " blum told the newspaper .
another study released this week showed that the eastern german economy has caught up with the west faster than expected .
the private cologne-based iw institute said that gross domestic product per capita , a key indicator of living standards , has risen in the east from 30 percent of that in the west in 1991 to 70 percent today .
the institute said that by 2020 , average gdp per capita in the east could reach 80 percent of that in the west and that the most prosperous eastern states could have overtaken the poorest of their western counterparts. rb / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the last two decades , we have neglected to invest in roads and rail " in the west , ramsauer told the newspaper , referring to the reunification of east and west germany 20 years ago .
" now the time has come to make up for what we have failed to do , " he added .
he said there was a " considerable backlog " of important construction projects in western germany .
ramsauer said thanks to a 5.5 percent solidarity tax on german taxpayers and hundreds of billions of euros in state funding , roads and other infrastructure in the former east germany were no longer in disrepair but had instead been transformed into some of the finest in the world .
the transport minister added that this progress was sometimes achieved at the cost of infrastructure in western germany .
ramsauer ’ s comments have drawn negative reactions from some other members of the governing coalition , especially as they came amid celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the wall tumbling and national unification .
cornelia pieper , deputy chairman of the free democrats – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative bloc – criticized ramsauer ’ s comments as a " tasteless contribution . "
she was quoted as telling the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper that the minister had made the comments " in complete disregard for reality and has unnecessarily disturbed this day of joy . "

the halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- said the huge sum spent between 1991 and 2005 , had largely gone toward social welfare payments for easterners .
iwh president ulrich blum said only about 10 percent of the subsidies had gone to measures intended to spur economic growth while about 67 percent went towards social welfare benefits .
" the fact that the transfers increased rather than decreased in the last few years shocked us , " blum told the newspaper .
another study released this week showed that the eastern german economy has caught up with the west faster than expected .
the private cologne-based iw institute said that gross domestic product per capita , a key indicator of living standards , has risen in the east from 30 percent of that in the west in 1991 to 70 percent today .
the institute said that by 2020 , average gdp per capita in the east could reach 80 percent of that in the west and that the most prosperous eastern states could have overtaken the poorest of their western counterparts. rb / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out . " on the other hand , nolte was surprised by the skepticism that french president francois mitterrand apparently had toward german reunification .
" that 's the biggest revelation from my point of view , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : even francois mitterand , left , harbored misgivings about having a new , unified neighbor wary france the speed with which germany under kohl moved toward reunification seems to have taken europe 's leaders by surprise .
in october 1989 an analysis of the " german question " by the french foreign ministry judged that reunification " does not appear realistic at this moment . " in a letter dated nov .
24 , 1989 from mitterrand to east german leader egon krenz , the french president talked of " perspectives of development in relations with the german democratic republic and the european community . "
four days later kohl introduced his 10-point unification plan to the world . by presenting this program , the normally wary kohl shrewdly seized the initiative both at home , where the opposition social democrats were threatening to steal the issue from him , and abroad .
among the 244 newly released foreign office documents , british ambassador in bonn sir christopher mallaby summed up its significance on the same day . " the key point is that the pressures have reached a level where kohl has felt obliged to make a high profile statement of a policy expressly intended to lead in time to german unity , " he wrote to the british government , " and he has done so on his own authority , not on behalf of the whole coalition , and without prior consultation with the allies … it shows how fast the german question is moving .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 08.11.2009 germany 's neighbors try to redeem their 1989 negativity 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher was openly hostile to the reunification of germany the recent reopening of archives from 1989 has revealed embarrassing bigotry in some former european leaders .
the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out . " on the other hand , nolte was surprised by the skepticism that french president francois mitterrand apparently had toward german reunification .
" that 's the biggest revelation from my point of view , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : even francois mitterand , left , harbored misgivings about having a new , unified neighbor wary france the speed with which germany under kohl moved toward reunification seems to have taken europe 's leaders by surprise .
in october 1989 an analysis of the " german question " by the french foreign ministry judged that reunification " does not appear realistic at this moment . " in a letter dated nov .
24 , 1989 from mitterrand to east german leader egon krenz , the french president talked of " perspectives of development in relations with the german democratic republic and the european community . "
four days later kohl introduced his 10-point unification plan to the world . by presenting this program , the normally wary kohl shrewdly seized the initiative both at home , where the opposition social democrats were threatening to steal the issue from him , and abroad .
among the 244 newly released foreign office documents , british ambassador in bonn sir christopher mallaby summed up its significance on the same day . " the key point is that the pressures have reached a level where kohl has felt obliged to make a high profile statement of a policy expressly intended to lead in time to german unity , " he wrote to the british government , " and he has done so on his own authority , not on behalf of the whole coalition , and without prior consultation with the allies … it shows how fast the german question is moving .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .

the allied military presence in respective sectors gave west berlin the feel of an occupied zone well into the 1980 's .
" western soldiers were customers in shops , in hairdressers .
they were part of everyday life , " reminds nolte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification was not only a domestic problem " it was not just a german problem - something that was split up that had to be reunified - but the whole history of world war ii hung over it .
the international legal situation still had to be cleared up , as the two-plus-four negotiations of 1990 showed , " nolte says .
the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .
" if the people of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic decide freely and democratically in favor of unity , there is no way of stopping that , short of military action , " he told her . the timing of the release of such documents - a full decade before british law required it - shows that the british foreign office apparently felt that its diplomatic reputation needed a little rehabilitation . this is somewhat surprising to roedder .
" the british and the french apparently have a significant need to explain themselves .
i do n't really understand it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i can see that the british and french governments , in a new unified europe , see their own attitudes in a bad light .
it 's also curious that the french are celebrating the 20th anniversary on the champs-élysées .
but the fact that a lot of british and french people were n't exactly overjoyed at the thought of a reunified germany , is completely understandable .
it changed the power balance in europe . " twin fears thatcher had two main fears that were feeding each other in the fraught year between the fall of the berlin wall and reunification - a united germany would be able to strengthen the european community , and a stronger ec would in turn increase germany 's power .
thatcher 's position was in fact not far from the more hysterical right-wing body of opinion in britain , expressed by backbench mps , that germany planned to use the european community to dominate the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how could anyone have been against it ? " while she aired her suspicions publicly , mitterand kept his misgivings private .
the french president was committed to the european project , and in exchange for his blessing for a unified germany , was able to extract from kohl his commitment to european economic and monetary union .
this was exactly what thatcher feared .
" the problems will not be overcome by strengthening the ec .
germany ’ s ambitions would then become the dominant and active factor , " thatcher was quoted as saying in february 1990 . the result was that britain 's diplomacy became crippled in europe and elsewhere .
the german press seized on britain 's perceived negativity and magnified it , until it damaged britain 's relationship with the us , a nation that remained enthusiastic about reunification throughout . the fears of foreign office official sir john fretwell , expressed with some foresight late in 1989 , came true : " if we tried to stand against this tide , we should enter into fundamental political conflict with the federal republic of germany and with many of our allies , including the united states . "
if britain did not begin to convey the impression that it shared the vision of a united europe , he said later , the germans " will be tempted increasingly to move ahead without us on these fundamental issues of european policy . " when thatcher was finally brought down by her own party , in part because of her recalcitrance on european policy , the significance was not lost on those germans .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .

the allied military presence in respective sectors gave west berlin the feel of an occupied zone well into the 1980 's .
" western soldiers were customers in shops , in hairdressers .
they were part of everyday life , " reminds nolte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification was not only a domestic problem " it was not just a german problem - something that was split up that had to be reunified - but the whole history of world war ii hung over it .
the international legal situation still had to be cleared up , as the two-plus-four negotiations of 1990 showed , " nolte says .
the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .
" if the people of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic decide freely and democratically in favor of unity , there is no way of stopping that , short of military action , " he told her . the timing of the release of such documents - a full decade before british law required it - shows that the british foreign office apparently felt that its diplomatic reputation needed a little rehabilitation . this is somewhat surprising to roedder .
" the british and the french apparently have a significant need to explain themselves .
i do n't really understand it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i can see that the british and french governments , in a new unified europe , see their own attitudes in a bad light .
it 's also curious that the french are celebrating the 20th anniversary on the champs-élysées .
but the fact that a lot of british and french people were n't exactly overjoyed at the thought of a reunified germany , is completely understandable .
it changed the power balance in europe . " twin fears thatcher had two main fears that were feeding each other in the fraught year between the fall of the berlin wall and reunification - a united germany would be able to strengthen the european community , and a stronger ec would in turn increase germany 's power .
thatcher 's position was in fact not far from the more hysterical right-wing body of opinion in britain , expressed by backbench mps , that germany planned to use the european community to dominate the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how could anyone have been against it ? " while she aired her suspicions publicly , mitterand kept his misgivings private .
the french president was committed to the european project , and in exchange for his blessing for a unified germany , was able to extract from kohl his commitment to european economic and monetary union .
this was exactly what thatcher feared .
" the problems will not be overcome by strengthening the ec .
germany ’ s ambitions would then become the dominant and active factor , " thatcher was quoted as saying in february 1990 . the result was that britain 's diplomacy became crippled in europe and elsewhere .
the german press seized on britain 's perceived negativity and magnified it , until it damaged britain 's relationship with the us , a nation that remained enthusiastic about reunification throughout . the fears of foreign office official sir john fretwell , expressed with some foresight late in 1989 , came true : " if we tried to stand against this tide , we should enter into fundamental political conflict with the federal republic of germany and with many of our allies , including the united states . "
if britain did not begin to convey the impression that it shared the vision of a united europe , he said later , the germans " will be tempted increasingly to move ahead without us on these fundamental issues of european policy . " when thatcher was finally brought down by her own party , in part because of her recalcitrance on european policy , the significance was not lost on those germans .

the allied military presence in respective sectors gave west berlin the feel of an occupied zone well into the 1980 's .
" western soldiers were customers in shops , in hairdressers .
they were part of everyday life , " reminds nolte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification was not only a domestic problem " it was not just a german problem - something that was split up that had to be reunified - but the whole history of world war ii hung over it .
the international legal situation still had to be cleared up , as the two-plus-four negotiations of 1990 showed , " nolte says .
the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .
" if the people of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic decide freely and democratically in favor of unity , there is no way of stopping that , short of military action , " he told her . the timing of the release of such documents - a full decade before british law required it - shows that the british foreign office apparently felt that its diplomatic reputation needed a little rehabilitation . this is somewhat surprising to roedder .
" the british and the french apparently have a significant need to explain themselves .
i do n't really understand it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i can see that the british and french governments , in a new unified europe , see their own attitudes in a bad light .
it 's also curious that the french are celebrating the 20th anniversary on the champs-élysées .
but the fact that a lot of british and french people were n't exactly overjoyed at the thought of a reunified germany , is completely understandable .
it changed the power balance in europe . " twin fears thatcher had two main fears that were feeding each other in the fraught year between the fall of the berlin wall and reunification - a united germany would be able to strengthen the european community , and a stronger ec would in turn increase germany 's power .
thatcher 's position was in fact not far from the more hysterical right-wing body of opinion in britain , expressed by backbench mps , that germany planned to use the european community to dominate the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how could anyone have been against it ? " while she aired her suspicions publicly , mitterand kept his misgivings private .
the french president was committed to the european project , and in exchange for his blessing for a unified germany , was able to extract from kohl his commitment to european economic and monetary union .
this was exactly what thatcher feared .
" the problems will not be overcome by strengthening the ec .
germany ’ s ambitions would then become the dominant and active factor , " thatcher was quoted as saying in february 1990 . the result was that britain 's diplomacy became crippled in europe and elsewhere .
the german press seized on britain 's perceived negativity and magnified it , until it damaged britain 's relationship with the us , a nation that remained enthusiastic about reunification throughout . the fears of foreign office official sir john fretwell , expressed with some foresight late in 1989 , came true : " if we tried to stand against this tide , we should enter into fundamental political conflict with the federal republic of germany and with many of our allies , including the united states . "
if britain did not begin to convey the impression that it shared the vision of a united europe , he said later , the germans " will be tempted increasingly to move ahead without us on these fundamental issues of european policy . " when thatcher was finally brought down by her own party , in part because of her recalcitrance on european policy , the significance was not lost on those germans .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out . " on the other hand , nolte was surprised by the skepticism that french president francois mitterrand apparently had toward german reunification .
" that 's the biggest revelation from my point of view , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : even francois mitterand , left , harbored misgivings about having a new , unified neighbor wary france the speed with which germany under kohl moved toward reunification seems to have taken europe 's leaders by surprise .
in october 1989 an analysis of the " german question " by the french foreign ministry judged that reunification " does not appear realistic at this moment . " in a letter dated nov .
24 , 1989 from mitterrand to east german leader egon krenz , the french president talked of " perspectives of development in relations with the german democratic republic and the european community . "
four days later kohl introduced his 10-point unification plan to the world . by presenting this program , the normally wary kohl shrewdly seized the initiative both at home , where the opposition social democrats were threatening to steal the issue from him , and abroad .
among the 244 newly released foreign office documents , british ambassador in bonn sir christopher mallaby summed up its significance on the same day . " the key point is that the pressures have reached a level where kohl has felt obliged to make a high profile statement of a policy expressly intended to lead in time to german unity , " he wrote to the british government , " and he has done so on his own authority , not on behalf of the whole coalition , and without prior consultation with the allies … it shows how fast the german question is moving .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out . " on the other hand , nolte was surprised by the skepticism that french president francois mitterrand apparently had toward german reunification .
" that 's the biggest revelation from my point of view , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : even francois mitterand , left , harbored misgivings about having a new , unified neighbor wary france the speed with which germany under kohl moved toward reunification seems to have taken europe 's leaders by surprise .
in october 1989 an analysis of the " german question " by the french foreign ministry judged that reunification " does not appear realistic at this moment . " in a letter dated nov .
24 , 1989 from mitterrand to east german leader egon krenz , the french president talked of " perspectives of development in relations with the german democratic republic and the european community . "
four days later kohl introduced his 10-point unification plan to the world . by presenting this program , the normally wary kohl shrewdly seized the initiative both at home , where the opposition social democrats were threatening to steal the issue from him , and abroad .
among the 244 newly released foreign office documents , british ambassador in bonn sir christopher mallaby summed up its significance on the same day . " the key point is that the pressures have reached a level where kohl has felt obliged to make a high profile statement of a policy expressly intended to lead in time to german unity , " he wrote to the british government , " and he has done so on his own authority , not on behalf of the whole coalition , and without prior consultation with the allies … it shows how fast the german question is moving .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 08.11.2009 november 9 , 1989 - the day that changed european history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few remnants of the wall can still be seen in berlin in a press conference on nov .
9 , 1989 gdr central committee spokesman guenter schabowski unintentionally announced that citizens could travel to west germany immediately .
it was the beginning of the end for east germany . guenter schabowski 's press conference on november 9 , 1989 was a fairly dull affair for most of its duration , according to those present .
but a question by an italian journalist right at the end turned it into one of european history 's most memorable events .
schabowski was asked just before 7 p.m. about when a new law permitting gdr citizens more freedom of travel would go into effect .
schabowski famously told the journalist : " as far as i know , that goes into effect now , immediately . "
since television viewers in both east and west germany were following the live press conference , his comments electrified east germans and eventually led to a redrawing of the european map .
immediately following the remark , gdr citizens rushed to the border separating east and west berlin , wanting to visit the western part of the city .
the gdr border guards were unaware of the press conference , and , taken aback by the crowds gathering in front of them , made repeated calls to their superiors asking for guidance .
they successfully prevented citizens from crossing the border for three hours .
but later in the evening , the guards relented and opened the borders .
people were able to cross freely from east to west for the first time since the wall was erected on august 21 , 1961 .
" we are the people ! "
in the months prior to schabowski 's press conference , thousands of gdr citizens had taken to the streets demanding political reform .
the so-called " monday demonstrators " in the eastern city of leipzig had drawn special attention for their protests .
shouts by demonstrators of " we are the people ! " became commonplace , followed by " gorbi !
gorbi ! " – calls directed at mikhail gorbachev , the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union .
since 1985 , gorbachev had been implementing reforms in his country , and germans living in the gdr hoped to see his ideas adopted there as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70,000 protestors took to the streets on october 9 , 1989 in leipzig however , the hardline government under gdr leader erich honecker was not interested in reform , and the government 's refusal to change ultimately led to its own demise .
on october 18 , 1989 , honecker was forced to step down .
he was replaced by egon krenz as head of state , but even this shift could not prevent the gdr 's collapse .
a november 4 protest at berlin 's alexanderplatz attracted 500,000 people , making it clear that a change of leadership would not win the people 's trust .
when the berlin wall opened five days later , demands for reunification of east and west germany grew louder .
german unity and european integration in light of the increasing support for reunification , western diplomats travelled to the gdr a few weeks after the wall 's opening .
france and england in particular reacted with mistrust to the prospect of the large and economically powerful german state that reunification would create in the heart of europe .
if they could not stop reunification entirely , the two countries at least hoped to apply political sanctions on germany .
helmut kohl , then-chancellor of germany , kept their position in mind as he delivered a speech in front of the ruins of dresden 's " frauenkirche " cathedral that drew worldwide attention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and francois mitterrand negotiated on the future of the gdr kohl declared that german unity would only be possible in the context of a more unified europe generally .
he said german and european unification were just two sides of the same coin .
his speech garnered thunderous applause from the gdr citizens in attendance .
nevertheless , french president francois mitterrand travelled to the gdr two days later in an attempt to prevent west germany from annexing the east .
by early 1990 , the international community watched closely the process of german reunification to ensure that the interests of germans as well as of the four conquering allied powers from world war ii -lrb- england , france , the us and the soviet union -rrb- were respected .
german negotiators worked out the conditions of a german reunification internally , while both west and east german officials consulted with the four powers about the international ramifications of their proposal .
this so-called " 2 plus 4 " process -lrb- representing the two german states and the four allied powers -rrb- concluded with a declaration of sovereignty for germany on september 12 , 1990 .
german negotiations had already resulted in a contract that specified all aspects of the new relationship between east and west germany on august 31 , 1990 .
on october 3 , 1990 , the former east german states officially joined the federal republic of germany .
the date marked the end of the gdr and the beginning of a reunified federal republic .

" in the last two decades , we have neglected to invest in roads and rail " in the west , ramsauer told the newspaper , referring to the reunification of east and west germany 20 years ago .
" now the time has come to make up for what we have failed to do , " he added .
he said there was a " considerable backlog " of important construction projects in western germany .
ramsauer said thanks to a 5.5 percent solidarity tax on german taxpayers and hundreds of billions of euros in state funding , roads and other infrastructure in the former east germany were no longer in disrepair but had instead been transformed into some of the finest in the world .
the transport minister added that this progress was sometimes achieved at the cost of infrastructure in western germany .
ramsauer ’ s comments have drawn negative reactions from some other members of the governing coalition , especially as they came amid celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the wall tumbling and national unification .
cornelia pieper , deputy chairman of the free democrats – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative bloc – criticized ramsauer ’ s comments as a " tasteless contribution . "
she was quoted as telling the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper that the minister had made the comments " in complete disregard for reality and has unnecessarily disturbed this day of joy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minister has called for stepping up investment in infrastructure in the west ‘ 1.3 trillion euros transferred to former east germany ’ a new study out on sunday showed that reunited germany transferred some 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 trillion -rrb- to prop up the former communist east in the years following the berlin wall 's fall .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- said the huge sum spent between 1991 and 2005 , had largely gone toward social welfare payments for easterners .
iwh president ulrich blum said only about 10 percent of the subsidies had gone to measures intended to spur economic growth while about 67 percent went towards social welfare benefits .
" the fact that the transfers increased rather than decreased in the last few years shocked us , " blum told the newspaper .
another study released this week showed that the eastern german economy has caught up with the west faster than expected .
the private cologne-based iw institute said that gross domestic product per capita , a key indicator of living standards , has risen in the east from 30 percent of that in the west in 1991 to 70 percent today .
the institute said that by 2020 , average gdp per capita in the east could reach 80 percent of that in the west and that the most prosperous eastern states could have overtaken the poorest of their western counterparts. rb / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

who should pay for environmental protection ?
that question is proving difficult to answer .
the upcoming climate conference in copenhagen could fail , warns germany 's development minister , dirk niebel . one month before the world climate conference in copenhagen , federal development minister dirk niebel is doubtful about the chances for agreement on new climate standards .
" the national government wants this to succeed , " niebel told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday .
" but there is real doubt about whether it is going to be possible at this time . "
niebel noted that even some sort of resolution outlining core goals for an international accord could be considered a success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel is worried that a new accord to replace the kyoto protocol may not be found climate protection gets expensive the climate summit in copenhagen is supposed to come up with a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
however , industrial and developing nations continue to argue over which countries must reduce their emissions and who should bear the costs of carbon dioxide reduction measures .
according to eu estimates , the earth 's poorest nations will need about 100 billion euros per year until 2020 .
about 22 to 50 billion euros of that will come from the public purse .
the eu has indicated that it is prepared to cover about a third of the costs .
but an agreement among all the industrialized countries is still pending .
" if there is n't an agreement on financing , if there is n't an agreement about contributions to make sure we can deal with this problem , then the copenhagen agreement is going to be much , much more difficult , " british finance minister alistair darling said on saturday , after finance ministers from the g20 countries met in st. andrews , scotland .
developing countries protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drought and rising temperatures are a growing problem in africa the eu is prepared to unilaterally reduce its emissions by 20 percent by 2020 - and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries join in .
according to an assessment by the copenhagen climate council , developed countries must reduce their emissions by 25 to 40 percent in order to hold an increase in global temperatures to two degrees .
for the developing countries , these promises are not enough .
during pre-copenhagen preparatory talks , held earlier this month in barcelona , 50 african countries temporarily walked out of the proceedings to protest what they saw as foot-dragging by the wealthier countries .
these nations , says the so-called " group of 77 " developing and threshhold countries , must reduce their emissions by at least 40 percent by 2020. svs / ap / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out .

24 , 1989 from mitterrand to east german leader egon krenz , the french president talked of " perspectives of development in relations with the german democratic republic and the european community . "
four days later kohl introduced his 10-point unification plan to the world . by presenting this program , the normally wary kohl shrewdly seized the initiative both at home , where the opposition social democrats were threatening to steal the issue from him , and abroad .

the allied military presence in respective sectors gave west berlin the feel of an occupied zone well into the 1980 's .
" western soldiers were customers in shops , in hairdressers .
they were part of everyday life , " reminds nolte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification was not only a domestic problem " it was not just a german problem - something that was split up that had to be reunified - but the whole history of world war ii hung over it .
the international legal situation still had to be cleared up , as the two-plus-four negotiations of 1990 showed , " nolte says .
the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .
" if the people of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic decide freely and democratically in favor of unity , there is no way of stopping that , short of military action , " he told her . the timing of the release of such documents - a full decade before british law required it - shows that the british foreign office apparently felt that its diplomatic reputation needed a little rehabilitation . this is somewhat surprising to roedder .
" the british and the french apparently have a significant need to explain themselves .
i do n't really understand it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i can see that the british and french governments , in a new unified europe , see their own attitudes in a bad light .
it 's also curious that the french are celebrating the 20th anniversary on the champs-élysées .
but the fact that a lot of british and french people were n't exactly overjoyed at the thought of a reunified germany , is completely understandable .
it changed the power balance in europe . " twin fears thatcher had two main fears that were feeding each other in the fraught year between the fall of the berlin wall and reunification - a united germany would be able to strengthen the european community , and a stronger ec would in turn increase germany 's power .
thatcher 's position was in fact not far from the more hysterical right-wing body of opinion in britain , expressed by backbench mps , that germany planned to use the european community to dominate the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how could anyone have been against it ? " while she aired her suspicions publicly , mitterand kept his misgivings private .
the french president was committed to the european project , and in exchange for his blessing for a unified germany , was able to extract from kohl his commitment to european economic and monetary union .
this was exactly what thatcher feared .
" the problems will not be overcome by strengthening the ec .
germany ’ s ambitions would then become the dominant and active factor , " thatcher was quoted as saying in february 1990 . the result was that britain 's diplomacy became crippled in europe and elsewhere .
the german press seized on britain 's perceived negativity and magnified it , until it damaged britain 's relationship with the us , a nation that remained enthusiastic about reunification throughout . the fears of foreign office official sir john fretwell , expressed with some foresight late in 1989 , came true : " if we tried to stand against this tide , we should enter into fundamental political conflict with the federal republic of germany and with many of our allies , including the united states . "
if britain did not begin to convey the impression that it shared the vision of a united europe , he said later , the germans " will be tempted increasingly to move ahead without us on these fundamental issues of european policy . " when thatcher was finally brought down by her own party , in part because of her recalcitrance on european policy , the significance was not lost on those germans .

the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .
" if the people of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic decide freely and democratically in favor of unity , there is no way of stopping that , short of military action , " he told her . the timing of the release of such documents - a full decade before british law required it - shows that the british foreign office apparently felt that its diplomatic reputation needed a little rehabilitation . this is somewhat surprising to roedder .
" the british and the french apparently have a significant need to explain themselves .
i do n't really understand it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i can see that the british and french governments , in a new unified europe , see their own attitudes in a bad light .
it 's also curious that the french are celebrating the 20th anniversary on the champs-élysées .
but the fact that a lot of british and french people were n't exactly overjoyed at the thought of a reunified germany , is completely understandable .
it changed the power balance in europe . " twin fears thatcher had two main fears that were feeding each other in the fraught year between the fall of the berlin wall and reunification - a united germany would be able to strengthen the european community , and a stronger ec would in turn increase germany 's power .
thatcher 's position was in fact not far from the more hysterical right-wing body of opinion in britain , expressed by backbench mps , that germany planned to use the european community to dominate the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how could anyone have been against it ? " while she aired her suspicions publicly , mitterand kept his misgivings private .
the french president was committed to the european project , and in exchange for his blessing for a unified germany , was able to extract from kohl his commitment to european economic and monetary union .
this was exactly what thatcher feared .
" the problems will not be overcome by strengthening the ec .
germany ’ s ambitions would then become the dominant and active factor , " thatcher was quoted as saying in february 1990 . the result was that britain 's diplomacy became crippled in europe and elsewhere .
the german press seized on britain 's perceived negativity and magnified it , until it damaged britain 's relationship with the us , a nation that remained enthusiastic about reunification throughout . the fears of foreign office official sir john fretwell , expressed with some foresight late in 1989 , came true : " if we tried to stand against this tide , we should enter into fundamental political conflict with the federal republic of germany and with many of our allies , including the united states . "
if britain did not begin to convey the impression that it shared the vision of a united europe , he said later , the germans " will be tempted increasingly to move ahead without us on these fundamental issues of european policy . " when thatcher was finally brought down by her own party , in part because of her recalcitrance on european policy , the significance was not lost on those germans .

" now the time has come to make up for what we have failed to do , " he added .
he said there was a " considerable backlog " of important construction projects in western germany .
ramsauer said thanks to a 5.5 percent solidarity tax on german taxpayers and hundreds of billions of euros in state funding , roads and other infrastructure in the former east germany were no longer in disrepair but had instead been transformed into some of the finest in the world .
the transport minister added that this progress was sometimes achieved at the cost of infrastructure in western germany .

" in the last two decades , we have neglected to invest in roads and rail " in the west , ramsauer told the newspaper , referring to the reunification of east and west germany 20 years ago .
" now the time has come to make up for what we have failed to do , " he added .
he said there was a " considerable backlog " of important construction projects in western germany .
ramsauer said thanks to a 5.5 percent solidarity tax on german taxpayers and hundreds of billions of euros in state funding , roads and other infrastructure in the former east germany were no longer in disrepair but had instead been transformed into some of the finest in the world .
the transport minister added that this progress was sometimes achieved at the cost of infrastructure in western germany .
ramsauer ’ s comments have drawn negative reactions from some other members of the governing coalition , especially as they came amid celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the wall tumbling and national unification .
cornelia pieper , deputy chairman of the free democrats – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative bloc – criticized ramsauer ’ s comments as a " tasteless contribution . "
she was quoted as telling the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper that the minister had made the comments " in complete disregard for reality and has unnecessarily disturbed this day of joy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minister has called for stepping up investment in infrastructure in the west ‘ 1.3 trillion euros transferred to former east germany ’ a new study out on sunday showed that reunited germany transferred some 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 trillion -rrb- to prop up the former communist east in the years following the berlin wall 's fall .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- said the huge sum spent between 1991 and 2005 , had largely gone toward social welfare payments for easterners .
iwh president ulrich blum said only about 10 percent of the subsidies had gone to measures intended to spur economic growth while about 67 percent went towards social welfare benefits .
" the fact that the transfers increased rather than decreased in the last few years shocked us , " blum told the newspaper .
another study released this week showed that the eastern german economy has caught up with the west faster than expected .
the private cologne-based iw institute said that gross domestic product per capita , a key indicator of living standards , has risen in the east from 30 percent of that in the west in 1991 to 70 percent today .
the institute said that by 2020 , average gdp per capita in the east could reach 80 percent of that in the west and that the most prosperous eastern states could have overtaken the poorest of their western counterparts. rb / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of germany 's employer 's association , dieter hundt , has rejected further aid to opel , arguing that many small and mid-sized businesses in germany had been hit just as badly by the economic crisis .
hundt said if any aid is provided it should be done through the already existing " deutschlandfond " , which is open to all struggling businesses .
meanwhile , klaus franz , the head of opel 's works council which represents employees , urged general motors to appoint a german executive to manage its european operations .
gm has hinted that it is looking for a german after the resignation of its european ceo , carl-peter forster , who had been an outspoken supporter of the magna deal .

9 , 1989 gdr central committee spokesman guenter schabowski unintentionally announced that citizens could travel to west germany immediately .
it was the beginning of the end for east germany . guenter schabowski 's press conference on november 9 , 1989 was a fairly dull affair for most of its duration , according to those present .
but a question by an italian journalist right at the end turned it into one of european history 's most memorable events .
schabowski was asked just before 7 p.m. about when a new law permitting gdr citizens more freedom of travel would go into effect .
schabowski famously told the journalist : " as far as i know , that goes into effect now , immediately . "
since television viewers in both east and west germany were following the live press conference , his comments electrified east germans and eventually led to a redrawing of the european map .
immediately following the remark , gdr citizens rushed to the border separating east and west berlin , wanting to visit the western part of the city .
the gdr border guards were unaware of the press conference , and , taken aback by the crowds gathering in front of them , made repeated calls to their superiors asking for guidance .
they successfully prevented citizens from crossing the border for three hours .
but later in the evening , the guards relented and opened the borders .
people were able to cross freely from east to west for the first time since the wall was erected on august 21 , 1961 .
" we are the people ! "
in the months prior to schabowski 's press conference , thousands of gdr citizens had taken to the streets demanding political reform .
the so-called " monday demonstrators " in the eastern city of leipzig had drawn special attention for their protests .
shouts by demonstrators of " we are the people ! " became commonplace , followed by " gorbi !
gorbi ! " – calls directed at mikhail gorbachev , the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union .
since 1985 , gorbachev had been implementing reforms in his country , and germans living in the gdr hoped to see his ideas adopted there as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70,000 protestors took to the streets on october 9 , 1989 in leipzig however , the hardline government under gdr leader erich honecker was not interested in reform , and the government 's refusal to change ultimately led to its own demise .
on october 18 , 1989 , honecker was forced to step down .
he was replaced by egon krenz as head of state , but even this shift could not prevent the gdr 's collapse .
a november 4 protest at berlin 's alexanderplatz attracted 500,000 people , making it clear that a change of leadership would not win the people 's trust .
when the berlin wall opened five days later , demands for reunification of east and west germany grew louder .
german unity and european integration in light of the increasing support for reunification , western diplomats travelled to the gdr a few weeks after the wall 's opening .
france and england in particular reacted with mistrust to the prospect of the large and economically powerful german state that reunification would create in the heart of europe .
if they could not stop reunification entirely , the two countries at least hoped to apply political sanctions on germany .
helmut kohl , then-chancellor of germany , kept their position in mind as he delivered a speech in front of the ruins of dresden 's " frauenkirche " cathedral that drew worldwide attention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and francois mitterrand negotiated on the future of the gdr kohl declared that german unity would only be possible in the context of a more unified europe generally .
he said german and european unification were just two sides of the same coin .
his speech garnered thunderous applause from the gdr citizens in attendance .
nevertheless , french president francois mitterrand travelled to the gdr two days later in an attempt to prevent west germany from annexing the east .
by early 1990 , the international community watched closely the process of german reunification to ensure that the interests of germans as well as of the four conquering allied powers from world war ii -lrb- england , france , the us and the soviet union -rrb- were respected .
german negotiators worked out the conditions of a german reunification internally , while both west and east german officials consulted with the four powers about the international ramifications of their proposal .
this so-called " 2 plus 4 " process -lrb- representing the two german states and the four allied powers -rrb- concluded with a declaration of sovereignty for germany on september 12 , 1990 .
german negotiations had already resulted in a contract that specified all aspects of the new relationship between east and west germany on august 31 , 1990 .
on october 3 , 1990 , the former east german states officially joined the federal republic of germany .
the date marked the end of the gdr and the beginning of a reunified federal republic .

9 , 1989 gdr central committee spokesman guenter schabowski unintentionally announced that citizens could travel to west germany immediately .
it was the beginning of the end for east germany . guenter schabowski 's press conference on november 9 , 1989 was a fairly dull affair for most of its duration , according to those present .
but a question by an italian journalist right at the end turned it into one of european history 's most memorable events .
schabowski was asked just before 7 p.m. about when a new law permitting gdr citizens more freedom of travel would go into effect .
schabowski famously told the journalist : " as far as i know , that goes into effect now , immediately . "
since television viewers in both east and west germany were following the live press conference , his comments electrified east germans and eventually led to a redrawing of the european map .
immediately following the remark , gdr citizens rushed to the border separating east and west berlin , wanting to visit the western part of the city .
the gdr border guards were unaware of the press conference , and , taken aback by the crowds gathering in front of them , made repeated calls to their superiors asking for guidance .
they successfully prevented citizens from crossing the border for three hours .
but later in the evening , the guards relented and opened the borders .
people were able to cross freely from east to west for the first time since the wall was erected on august 21 , 1961 .
" we are the people ! "
in the months prior to schabowski 's press conference , thousands of gdr citizens had taken to the streets demanding political reform .
the so-called " monday demonstrators " in the eastern city of leipzig had drawn special attention for their protests .
shouts by demonstrators of " we are the people ! " became commonplace , followed by " gorbi !
gorbi ! " – calls directed at mikhail gorbachev , the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union .
since 1985 , gorbachev had been implementing reforms in his country , and germans living in the gdr hoped to see his ideas adopted there as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70,000 protestors took to the streets on october 9 , 1989 in leipzig however , the hardline government under gdr leader erich honecker was not interested in reform , and the government 's refusal to change ultimately led to its own demise .
on october 18 , 1989 , honecker was forced to step down .
he was replaced by egon krenz as head of state , but even this shift could not prevent the gdr 's collapse .
a november 4 protest at berlin 's alexanderplatz attracted 500,000 people , making it clear that a change of leadership would not win the people 's trust .
when the berlin wall opened five days later , demands for reunification of east and west germany grew louder .
german unity and european integration in light of the increasing support for reunification , western diplomats travelled to the gdr a few weeks after the wall 's opening .
france and england in particular reacted with mistrust to the prospect of the large and economically powerful german state that reunification would create in the heart of europe .
if they could not stop reunification entirely , the two countries at least hoped to apply political sanctions on germany .
helmut kohl , then-chancellor of germany , kept their position in mind as he delivered a speech in front of the ruins of dresden 's " frauenkirche " cathedral that drew worldwide attention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and francois mitterrand negotiated on the future of the gdr kohl declared that german unity would only be possible in the context of a more unified europe generally .
he said german and european unification were just two sides of the same coin .
his speech garnered thunderous applause from the gdr citizens in attendance .
nevertheless , french president francois mitterrand travelled to the gdr two days later in an attempt to prevent west germany from annexing the east .

that question is proving difficult to answer .
the upcoming climate conference in copenhagen could fail , warns germany 's development minister , dirk niebel . one month before the world climate conference in copenhagen , federal development minister dirk niebel is doubtful about the chances for agreement on new climate standards .
" the national government wants this to succeed , " niebel told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday .
" but there is real doubt about whether it is going to be possible at this time . "
niebel noted that even some sort of resolution outlining core goals for an international accord could be considered a success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel is worried that a new accord to replace the kyoto protocol may not be found climate protection gets expensive the climate summit in copenhagen is supposed to come up with a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
however , industrial and developing nations continue to argue over which countries must reduce their emissions and who should bear the costs of carbon dioxide reduction measures .
according to eu estimates , the earth 's poorest nations will need about 100 billion euros per year until 2020 .
about 22 to 50 billion euros of that will come from the public purse .
the eu has indicated that it is prepared to cover about a third of the costs .
but an agreement among all the industrialized countries is still pending .
" if there is n't an agreement on financing , if there is n't an agreement about contributions to make sure we can deal with this problem , then the copenhagen agreement is going to be much , much more difficult , " british finance minister alistair darling said on saturday , after finance ministers from the g20 countries met in st. andrews , scotland .

for the developing countries , these promises are not enough .
during pre-copenhagen preparatory talks , held earlier this month in barcelona , 50 african countries temporarily walked out of the proceedings to protest what they saw as foot-dragging by the wealthier countries .

in a speech , she honored all those who became victims of the east german regime , and also offered thanks to those who supported east germans in their struggle to live in a free society .
she also praised gorbachev for his role in reforming the soviet union .
" you made this possible , you courageously let things happen , and that was much more than we could expect , " she told gorbachev .
her words came ahead of the main ceremonies which will be held at the brandenburg gate .

bildunterschrift : artists , students and school children decorated the dominos symbolizing the fall of the wall " everyone has walls in their heads to a certain extent , " said one berlin resident stefan schueler , who was admiring the artwork .
" it is always a good thing if one can break them down , and i think this is a good symbol . "
" it 's really very beautiful , it 's a terrific idea , " said barbara graff , a 74-year-old city resident .
recalling november 9 , 1989 , she said that she went to west berlin 's main shopping street , kurfuerstendamm , and " distributed money to the people arriving en masse from the east . "

of those questioned , 28 percent said they approved of additional funding .
the german government has signaled it would be prepared to provide financial aid to opel , if gm paid back the portions of the transition loan it has already used .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister puts caveats on aid for opel german economics minister rainer bruederle , however , has warned gm that it had no automatic entitlement to the three billion euros in state aid promised for the original deal with canadian auto parts supplier magna .
the head of germany 's employer 's association , dieter hundt , has rejected further aid to opel , arguing that many small and mid-sized businesses in germany had been hit just as badly by the economic crisis .
hundt said if any aid is provided it should be done through the already existing " deutschlandfond " , which is open to all struggling businesses .
meanwhile , klaus franz , the head of opel 's works council which represents employees , urged general motors to appoint a german executive to manage its european operations .
gm has hinted that it is looking for a german after the resignation of its european ceo , carl-peter forster , who had been an outspoken supporter of the magna deal .
general motors ceo , fritz henderson , is expected to begin talks on reshaping opel at company headquarters in ruesselsheim this week. gb / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they were part of everyday life , " reminds nolte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification was not only a domestic problem " it was not just a german problem - something that was split up that had to be reunified - but the whole history of world war ii hung over it .

the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .
" if the people of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic decide freely and democratically in favor of unity , there is no way of stopping that , short of military action , " he told her . the timing of the release of such documents - a full decade before british law required it - shows that the british foreign office apparently felt that its diplomatic reputation needed a little rehabilitation . this is somewhat surprising to roedder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 08.11.2009 germany 's neighbors try to redeem their 1989 negativity 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher was openly hostile to the reunification of germany the recent reopening of archives from 1989 has revealed embarrassing bigotry in some former european leaders .
the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out . " on the other hand , nolte was surprised by the skepticism that french president francois mitterrand apparently had toward german reunification .
" that 's the biggest revelation from my point of view , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : even francois mitterand , left , harbored misgivings about having a new , unified neighbor wary france the speed with which germany under kohl moved toward reunification seems to have taken europe 's leaders by surprise .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .

" it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .

the allied military presence in respective sectors gave west berlin the feel of an occupied zone well into the 1980 's .
" western soldiers were customers in shops , in hairdressers .
they were part of everyday life , " reminds nolte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification was not only a domestic problem " it was not just a german problem - something that was split up that had to be reunified - but the whole history of world war ii hung over it .
the international legal situation still had to be cleared up , as the two-plus-four negotiations of 1990 showed , " nolte says .
the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .
" if the people of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic decide freely and democratically in favor of unity , there is no way of stopping that , short of military action , " he told her . the timing of the release of such documents - a full decade before british law required it - shows that the british foreign office apparently felt that its diplomatic reputation needed a little rehabilitation . this is somewhat surprising to roedder .
" the british and the french apparently have a significant need to explain themselves .
i do n't really understand it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i can see that the british and french governments , in a new unified europe , see their own attitudes in a bad light .
it 's also curious that the french are celebrating the 20th anniversary on the champs-élysées .
but the fact that a lot of british and french people were n't exactly overjoyed at the thought of a reunified germany , is completely understandable .
it changed the power balance in europe . " twin fears thatcher had two main fears that were feeding each other in the fraught year between the fall of the berlin wall and reunification - a united germany would be able to strengthen the european community , and a stronger ec would in turn increase germany 's power .
thatcher 's position was in fact not far from the more hysterical right-wing body of opinion in britain , expressed by backbench mps , that germany planned to use the european community to dominate the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how could anyone have been against it ? " while she aired her suspicions publicly , mitterand kept his misgivings private .
the french president was committed to the european project , and in exchange for his blessing for a unified germany , was able to extract from kohl his commitment to european economic and monetary union .
this was exactly what thatcher feared .
" the problems will not be overcome by strengthening the ec .
germany ’ s ambitions would then become the dominant and active factor , " thatcher was quoted as saying in february 1990 . the result was that britain 's diplomacy became crippled in europe and elsewhere .
the german press seized on britain 's perceived negativity and magnified it , until it damaged britain 's relationship with the us , a nation that remained enthusiastic about reunification throughout . the fears of foreign office official sir john fretwell , expressed with some foresight late in 1989 , came true : " if we tried to stand against this tide , we should enter into fundamental political conflict with the federal republic of germany and with many of our allies , including the united states . "
if britain did not begin to convey the impression that it shared the vision of a united europe , he said later , the germans " will be tempted increasingly to move ahead without us on these fundamental issues of european policy . " when thatcher was finally brought down by her own party , in part because of her recalcitrance on european policy , the significance was not lost on those germans .

the allied military presence in respective sectors gave west berlin the feel of an occupied zone well into the 1980 's .
" western soldiers were customers in shops , in hairdressers .
they were part of everyday life , " reminds nolte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification was not only a domestic problem " it was not just a german problem - something that was split up that had to be reunified - but the whole history of world war ii hung over it .
the international legal situation still had to be cleared up , as the two-plus-four negotiations of 1990 showed , " nolte says .
the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .
" if the people of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic decide freely and democratically in favor of unity , there is no way of stopping that , short of military action , " he told her . the timing of the release of such documents - a full decade before british law required it - shows that the british foreign office apparently felt that its diplomatic reputation needed a little rehabilitation . this is somewhat surprising to roedder .
" the british and the french apparently have a significant need to explain themselves .
i do n't really understand it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i can see that the british and french governments , in a new unified europe , see their own attitudes in a bad light .
it 's also curious that the french are celebrating the 20th anniversary on the champs-élysées .
but the fact that a lot of british and french people were n't exactly overjoyed at the thought of a reunified germany , is completely understandable .
it changed the power balance in europe . " twin fears thatcher had two main fears that were feeding each other in the fraught year between the fall of the berlin wall and reunification - a united germany would be able to strengthen the european community , and a stronger ec would in turn increase germany 's power .
thatcher 's position was in fact not far from the more hysterical right-wing body of opinion in britain , expressed by backbench mps , that germany planned to use the european community to dominate the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how could anyone have been against it ? " while she aired her suspicions publicly , mitterand kept his misgivings private .
the french president was committed to the european project , and in exchange for his blessing for a unified germany , was able to extract from kohl his commitment to european economic and monetary union .
this was exactly what thatcher feared .
" the problems will not be overcome by strengthening the ec .
germany ’ s ambitions would then become the dominant and active factor , " thatcher was quoted as saying in february 1990 . the result was that britain 's diplomacy became crippled in europe and elsewhere .
the german press seized on britain 's perceived negativity and magnified it , until it damaged britain 's relationship with the us , a nation that remained enthusiastic about reunification throughout . the fears of foreign office official sir john fretwell , expressed with some foresight late in 1989 , came true : " if we tried to stand against this tide , we should enter into fundamental political conflict with the federal republic of germany and with many of our allies , including the united states . "
if britain did not begin to convey the impression that it shared the vision of a united europe , he said later , the germans " will be tempted increasingly to move ahead without us on these fundamental issues of european policy . " when thatcher was finally brought down by her own party , in part because of her recalcitrance on european policy , the significance was not lost on those germans .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .

he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out . " on the other hand , nolte was surprised by the skepticism that french president francois mitterrand apparently had toward german reunification .
" that 's the biggest revelation from my point of view , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : even francois mitterand , left , harbored misgivings about having a new , unified neighbor wary france the speed with which germany under kohl moved toward reunification seems to have taken europe 's leaders by surprise .
in october 1989 an analysis of the " german question " by the french foreign ministry judged that reunification " does not appear realistic at this moment . " in a letter dated nov .
24 , 1989 from mitterrand to east german leader egon krenz , the french president talked of " perspectives of development in relations with the german democratic republic and the european community . "
four days later kohl introduced his 10-point unification plan to the world . by presenting this program , the normally wary kohl shrewdly seized the initiative both at home , where the opposition social democrats were threatening to steal the issue from him , and abroad .
among the 244 newly released foreign office documents , british ambassador in bonn sir christopher mallaby summed up its significance on the same day . " the key point is that the pressures have reached a level where kohl has felt obliged to make a high profile statement of a policy expressly intended to lead in time to german unity , " he wrote to the british government , " and he has done so on his own authority , not on behalf of the whole coalition , and without prior consultation with the allies … it shows how fast the german question is moving . "
in response , thatcher remarked , " christopher mallaby seems to welcome reunification . " read more about the allies ' concerns 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the allied military presence in respective sectors gave west berlin the feel of an occupied zone well into the 1980 's .
" western soldiers were customers in shops , in hairdressers .
they were part of everyday life , " reminds nolte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification was not only a domestic problem " it was not just a german problem - something that was split up that had to be reunified - but the whole history of world war ii hung over it .
the international legal situation still had to be cleared up , as the two-plus-four negotiations of 1990 showed , " nolte says .
the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .
" if the people of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic decide freely and democratically in favor of unity , there is no way of stopping that , short of military action , " he told her . the timing of the release of such documents - a full decade before british law required it - shows that the british foreign office apparently felt that its diplomatic reputation needed a little rehabilitation . this is somewhat surprising to roedder .
" the british and the french apparently have a significant need to explain themselves .
i do n't really understand it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i can see that the british and french governments , in a new unified europe , see their own attitudes in a bad light .
it 's also curious that the french are celebrating the 20th anniversary on the champs-élysées .
but the fact that a lot of british and french people were n't exactly overjoyed at the thought of a reunified germany , is completely understandable .
it changed the power balance in europe . " twin fears thatcher had two main fears that were feeding each other in the fraught year between the fall of the berlin wall and reunification - a united germany would be able to strengthen the european community , and a stronger ec would in turn increase germany 's power .
thatcher 's position was in fact not far from the more hysterical right-wing body of opinion in britain , expressed by backbench mps , that germany planned to use the european community to dominate the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how could anyone have been against it ? " while she aired her suspicions publicly , mitterand kept his misgivings private .
the french president was committed to the european project , and in exchange for his blessing for a unified germany , was able to extract from kohl his commitment to european economic and monetary union .
this was exactly what thatcher feared .
" the problems will not be overcome by strengthening the ec .
germany ’ s ambitions would then become the dominant and active factor , " thatcher was quoted as saying in february 1990 . the result was that britain 's diplomacy became crippled in europe and elsewhere .
the german press seized on britain 's perceived negativity and magnified it , until it damaged britain 's relationship with the us , a nation that remained enthusiastic about reunification throughout . the fears of foreign office official sir john fretwell , expressed with some foresight late in 1989 , came true : " if we tried to stand against this tide , we should enter into fundamental political conflict with the federal republic of germany and with many of our allies , including the united states . "
if britain did not begin to convey the impression that it shared the vision of a united europe , he said later , the germans " will be tempted increasingly to move ahead without us on these fundamental issues of european policy . " when thatcher was finally brought down by her own party , in part because of her recalcitrance on european policy , the significance was not lost on those germans .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out . " on the other hand , nolte was surprised by the skepticism that french president francois mitterrand apparently had toward german reunification .
" that 's the biggest revelation from my point of view , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : even francois mitterand , left , harbored misgivings about having a new , unified neighbor wary france the speed with which germany under kohl moved toward reunification seems to have taken europe 's leaders by surprise .
in october 1989 an analysis of the " german question " by the french foreign ministry judged that reunification " does not appear realistic at this moment . " in a letter dated nov .
24 , 1989 from mitterrand to east german leader egon krenz , the french president talked of " perspectives of development in relations with the german democratic republic and the european community . "
four days later kohl introduced his 10-point unification plan to the world . by presenting this program , the normally wary kohl shrewdly seized the initiative both at home , where the opposition social democrats were threatening to steal the issue from him , and abroad .
among the 244 newly released foreign office documents , british ambassador in bonn sir christopher mallaby summed up its significance on the same day . " the key point is that the pressures have reached a level where kohl has felt obliged to make a high profile statement of a policy expressly intended to lead in time to german unity , " he wrote to the british government , " and he has done so on his own authority , not on behalf of the whole coalition , and without prior consultation with the allies … it shows how fast the german question is moving .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .

" in the last two decades , we have neglected to invest in roads and rail " in the west , ramsauer told the newspaper , referring to the reunification of east and west germany 20 years ago .
" now the time has come to make up for what we have failed to do , " he added .
he said there was a " considerable backlog " of important construction projects in western germany .
ramsauer said thanks to a 5.5 percent solidarity tax on german taxpayers and hundreds of billions of euros in state funding , roads and other infrastructure in the former east germany were no longer in disrepair but had instead been transformed into some of the finest in the world .
the transport minister added that this progress was sometimes achieved at the cost of infrastructure in western germany .
ramsauer ’ s comments have drawn negative reactions from some other members of the governing coalition , especially as they came amid celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the wall tumbling and national unification .
cornelia pieper , deputy chairman of the free democrats – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative bloc – criticized ramsauer ’ s comments as a " tasteless contribution . "
she was quoted as telling the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper that the minister had made the comments " in complete disregard for reality and has unnecessarily disturbed this day of joy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minister has called for stepping up investment in infrastructure in the west ‘ 1.3 trillion euros transferred to former east germany ’ a new study out on sunday showed that reunited germany transferred some 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 trillion -rrb- to prop up the former communist east in the years following the berlin wall 's fall .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- said the huge sum spent between 1991 and 2005 , had largely gone toward social welfare payments for easterners .
iwh president ulrich blum said only about 10 percent of the subsidies had gone to measures intended to spur economic growth while about 67 percent went towards social welfare benefits .
" the fact that the transfers increased rather than decreased in the last few years shocked us , " blum told the newspaper .
another study released this week showed that the eastern german economy has caught up with the west faster than expected .
the private cologne-based iw institute said that gross domestic product per capita , a key indicator of living standards , has risen in the east from 30 percent of that in the west in 1991 to 70 percent today .
the institute said that by 2020 , average gdp per capita in the east could reach 80 percent of that in the west and that the most prosperous eastern states could have overtaken the poorest of their western counterparts. rb / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 , 1989 gdr central committee spokesman guenter schabowski unintentionally announced that citizens could travel to west germany immediately .
it was the beginning of the end for east germany . guenter schabowski 's press conference on november 9 , 1989 was a fairly dull affair for most of its duration , according to those present .
but a question by an italian journalist right at the end turned it into one of european history 's most memorable events .
schabowski was asked just before 7 p.m. about when a new law permitting gdr citizens more freedom of travel would go into effect .
schabowski famously told the journalist : " as far as i know , that goes into effect now , immediately . "
since television viewers in both east and west germany were following the live press conference , his comments electrified east germans and eventually led to a redrawing of the european map .
immediately following the remark , gdr citizens rushed to the border separating east and west berlin , wanting to visit the western part of the city .
the gdr border guards were unaware of the press conference , and , taken aback by the crowds gathering in front of them , made repeated calls to their superiors asking for guidance .
they successfully prevented citizens from crossing the border for three hours .
but later in the evening , the guards relented and opened the borders .
people were able to cross freely from east to west for the first time since the wall was erected on august 21 , 1961 .
" we are the people ! "
in the months prior to schabowski 's press conference , thousands of gdr citizens had taken to the streets demanding political reform .
the so-called " monday demonstrators " in the eastern city of leipzig had drawn special attention for their protests .
shouts by demonstrators of " we are the people ! " became commonplace , followed by " gorbi !
gorbi ! " – calls directed at mikhail gorbachev , the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union .
since 1985 , gorbachev had been implementing reforms in his country , and germans living in the gdr hoped to see his ideas adopted there as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70,000 protestors took to the streets on october 9 , 1989 in leipzig however , the hardline government under gdr leader erich honecker was not interested in reform , and the government 's refusal to change ultimately led to its own demise .
on october 18 , 1989 , honecker was forced to step down .
he was replaced by egon krenz as head of state , but even this shift could not prevent the gdr 's collapse .
a november 4 protest at berlin 's alexanderplatz attracted 500,000 people , making it clear that a change of leadership would not win the people 's trust .
when the berlin wall opened five days later , demands for reunification of east and west germany grew louder .
german unity and european integration in light of the increasing support for reunification , western diplomats travelled to the gdr a few weeks after the wall 's opening .
france and england in particular reacted with mistrust to the prospect of the large and economically powerful german state that reunification would create in the heart of europe .
if they could not stop reunification entirely , the two countries at least hoped to apply political sanctions on germany .
helmut kohl , then-chancellor of germany , kept their position in mind as he delivered a speech in front of the ruins of dresden 's " frauenkirche " cathedral that drew worldwide attention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and francois mitterrand negotiated on the future of the gdr kohl declared that german unity would only be possible in the context of a more unified europe generally .
he said german and european unification were just two sides of the same coin .
his speech garnered thunderous applause from the gdr citizens in attendance .
nevertheless , french president francois mitterrand travelled to the gdr two days later in an attempt to prevent west germany from annexing the east .
by early 1990 , the international community watched closely the process of german reunification to ensure that the interests of germans as well as of the four conquering allied powers from world war ii -lrb- england , france , the us and the soviet union -rrb- were respected .
german negotiators worked out the conditions of a german reunification internally , while both west and east german officials consulted with the four powers about the international ramifications of their proposal .
this so-called " 2 plus 4 " process -lrb- representing the two german states and the four allied powers -rrb- concluded with a declaration of sovereignty for germany on september 12 , 1990 .
german negotiations had already resulted in a contract that specified all aspects of the new relationship between east and west germany on august 31 , 1990 .
on october 3 , 1990 , the former east german states officially joined the federal republic of germany .
the date marked the end of the gdr and the beginning of a reunified federal republic .

9 , 1989 gdr central committee spokesman guenter schabowski unintentionally announced that citizens could travel to west germany immediately .
it was the beginning of the end for east germany . guenter schabowski 's press conference on november 9 , 1989 was a fairly dull affair for most of its duration , according to those present .
but a question by an italian journalist right at the end turned it into one of european history 's most memorable events .
schabowski was asked just before 7 p.m. about when a new law permitting gdr citizens more freedom of travel would go into effect .
schabowski famously told the journalist : " as far as i know , that goes into effect now , immediately . "
since television viewers in both east and west germany were following the live press conference , his comments electrified east germans and eventually led to a redrawing of the european map .
immediately following the remark , gdr citizens rushed to the border separating east and west berlin , wanting to visit the western part of the city .
the gdr border guards were unaware of the press conference , and , taken aback by the crowds gathering in front of them , made repeated calls to their superiors asking for guidance .
they successfully prevented citizens from crossing the border for three hours .
but later in the evening , the guards relented and opened the borders .
people were able to cross freely from east to west for the first time since the wall was erected on august 21 , 1961 .
" we are the people ! "
in the months prior to schabowski 's press conference , thousands of gdr citizens had taken to the streets demanding political reform .
the so-called " monday demonstrators " in the eastern city of leipzig had drawn special attention for their protests .
shouts by demonstrators of " we are the people ! " became commonplace , followed by " gorbi !
gorbi ! " – calls directed at mikhail gorbachev , the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union .
since 1985 , gorbachev had been implementing reforms in his country , and germans living in the gdr hoped to see his ideas adopted there as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70,000 protestors took to the streets on october 9 , 1989 in leipzig however , the hardline government under gdr leader erich honecker was not interested in reform , and the government 's refusal to change ultimately led to its own demise .
on october 18 , 1989 , honecker was forced to step down .
he was replaced by egon krenz as head of state , but even this shift could not prevent the gdr 's collapse .
a november 4 protest at berlin 's alexanderplatz attracted 500,000 people , making it clear that a change of leadership would not win the people 's trust .
when the berlin wall opened five days later , demands for reunification of east and west germany grew louder .
german unity and european integration in light of the increasing support for reunification , western diplomats travelled to the gdr a few weeks after the wall 's opening .
france and england in particular reacted with mistrust to the prospect of the large and economically powerful german state that reunification would create in the heart of europe .
if they could not stop reunification entirely , the two countries at least hoped to apply political sanctions on germany .
helmut kohl , then-chancellor of germany , kept their position in mind as he delivered a speech in front of the ruins of dresden 's " frauenkirche " cathedral that drew worldwide attention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and francois mitterrand negotiated on the future of the gdr kohl declared that german unity would only be possible in the context of a more unified europe generally .
he said german and european unification were just two sides of the same coin .
his speech garnered thunderous applause from the gdr citizens in attendance .
nevertheless , french president francois mitterrand travelled to the gdr two days later in an attempt to prevent west germany from annexing the east .
by early 1990 , the international community watched closely the process of german reunification to ensure that the interests of germans as well as of the four conquering allied powers from world war ii -lrb- england , france , the us and the soviet union -rrb- were respected .
german negotiators worked out the conditions of a german reunification internally , while both west and east german officials consulted with the four powers about the international ramifications of their proposal .
this so-called " 2 plus 4 " process -lrb- representing the two german states and the four allied powers -rrb- concluded with a declaration of sovereignty for germany on september 12 , 1990 .
german negotiations had already resulted in a contract that specified all aspects of the new relationship between east and west germany on august 31 , 1990 .
on october 3 , 1990 , the former east german states officially joined the federal republic of germany .
the date marked the end of the gdr and the beginning of a reunified federal republic .

" in the last two decades , we have neglected to invest in roads and rail " in the west , ramsauer told the newspaper , referring to the reunification of east and west germany 20 years ago .
" now the time has come to make up for what we have failed to do , " he added .
he said there was a " considerable backlog " of important construction projects in western germany .
ramsauer said thanks to a 5.5 percent solidarity tax on german taxpayers and hundreds of billions of euros in state funding , roads and other infrastructure in the former east germany were no longer in disrepair but had instead been transformed into some of the finest in the world .
the transport minister added that this progress was sometimes achieved at the cost of infrastructure in western germany .
ramsauer ’ s comments have drawn negative reactions from some other members of the governing coalition , especially as they came amid celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the wall tumbling and national unification .
cornelia pieper , deputy chairman of the free democrats – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative bloc – criticized ramsauer ’ s comments as a " tasteless contribution . "
she was quoted as telling the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper that the minister had made the comments " in complete disregard for reality and has unnecessarily disturbed this day of joy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minister has called for stepping up investment in infrastructure in the west ‘ 1.3 trillion euros transferred to former east germany ’ a new study out on sunday showed that reunited germany transferred some 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 trillion -rrb- to prop up the former communist east in the years following the berlin wall 's fall .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- said the huge sum spent between 1991 and 2005 , had largely gone toward social welfare payments for easterners .
iwh president ulrich blum said only about 10 percent of the subsidies had gone to measures intended to spur economic growth while about 67 percent went towards social welfare benefits .
" the fact that the transfers increased rather than decreased in the last few years shocked us , " blum told the newspaper .
another study released this week showed that the eastern german economy has caught up with the west faster than expected .
the private cologne-based iw institute said that gross domestic product per capita , a key indicator of living standards , has risen in the east from 30 percent of that in the west in 1991 to 70 percent today .
the institute said that by 2020 , average gdp per capita in the east could reach 80 percent of that in the west and that the most prosperous eastern states could have overtaken the poorest of their western counterparts. rb / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

who should pay for environmental protection ?
that question is proving difficult to answer .
the upcoming climate conference in copenhagen could fail , warns germany 's development minister , dirk niebel . one month before the world climate conference in copenhagen , federal development minister dirk niebel is doubtful about the chances for agreement on new climate standards .
" the national government wants this to succeed , " niebel told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday .
" but there is real doubt about whether it is going to be possible at this time . "
niebel noted that even some sort of resolution outlining core goals for an international accord could be considered a success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel is worried that a new accord to replace the kyoto protocol may not be found climate protection gets expensive the climate summit in copenhagen is supposed to come up with a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
however , industrial and developing nations continue to argue over which countries must reduce their emissions and who should bear the costs of carbon dioxide reduction measures .
according to eu estimates , the earth 's poorest nations will need about 100 billion euros per year until 2020 .
about 22 to 50 billion euros of that will come from the public purse .
the eu has indicated that it is prepared to cover about a third of the costs .
but an agreement among all the industrialized countries is still pending .
" if there is n't an agreement on financing , if there is n't an agreement about contributions to make sure we can deal with this problem , then the copenhagen agreement is going to be much , much more difficult , " british finance minister alistair darling said on saturday , after finance ministers from the g20 countries met in st. andrews , scotland .
developing countries protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drought and rising temperatures are a growing problem in africa the eu is prepared to unilaterally reduce its emissions by 20 percent by 2020 - and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries join in .
according to an assessment by the copenhagen climate council , developed countries must reduce their emissions by 25 to 40 percent in order to hold an increase in global temperatures to two degrees .
for the developing countries , these promises are not enough .
during pre-copenhagen preparatory talks , held earlier this month in barcelona , 50 african countries temporarily walked out of the proceedings to protest what they saw as foot-dragging by the wealthier countries .
these nations , says the so-called " group of 77 " developing and threshhold countries , must reduce their emissions by at least 40 percent by 2020. svs / ap / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de industrialized countries should set climate protection example , says expert as a key climate conference in copenhagen nears , some nations are still showing little willingness to reach an agreement to protect the earth .

" in the last two decades , we have neglected to invest in roads and rail " in the west , ramsauer told the newspaper , referring to the reunification of east and west germany 20 years ago .
" now the time has come to make up for what we have failed to do , " he added .
he said there was a " considerable backlog " of important construction projects in western germany .
ramsauer said thanks to a 5.5 percent solidarity tax on german taxpayers and hundreds of billions of euros in state funding , roads and other infrastructure in the former east germany were no longer in disrepair but had instead been transformed into some of the finest in the world .
the transport minister added that this progress was sometimes achieved at the cost of infrastructure in western germany .
ramsauer ’ s comments have drawn negative reactions from some other members of the governing coalition , especially as they came amid celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the wall tumbling and national unification .
cornelia pieper , deputy chairman of the free democrats – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative bloc – criticized ramsauer ’ s comments as a " tasteless contribution . "
she was quoted as telling the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper that the minister had made the comments " in complete disregard for reality and has unnecessarily disturbed this day of joy . "

the halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- said the huge sum spent between 1991 and 2005 , had largely gone toward social welfare payments for easterners .
iwh president ulrich blum said only about 10 percent of the subsidies had gone to measures intended to spur economic growth while about 67 percent went towards social welfare benefits .
" the fact that the transfers increased rather than decreased in the last few years shocked us , " blum told the newspaper .
another study released this week showed that the eastern german economy has caught up with the west faster than expected .
the private cologne-based iw institute said that gross domestic product per capita , a key indicator of living standards , has risen in the east from 30 percent of that in the west in 1991 to 70 percent today .
the institute said that by 2020 , average gdp per capita in the east could reach 80 percent of that in the west and that the most prosperous eastern states could have overtaken the poorest of their western counterparts. rb / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cornelia pieper , deputy chairman of the free democrats – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative bloc – criticized ramsauer ’ s comments as a " tasteless contribution . "
she was quoted as telling the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper that the minister had made the comments " in complete disregard for reality and has unnecessarily disturbed this day of joy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minister has called for stepping up investment in infrastructure in the west ‘ 1.3 trillion euros transferred to former east germany ’ a new study out on sunday showed that reunited germany transferred some 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 trillion -rrb- to prop up the former communist east in the years following the berlin wall 's fall .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- said the huge sum spent between 1991 and 2005 , had largely gone toward social welfare payments for easterners .
iwh president ulrich blum said only about 10 percent of the subsidies had gone to measures intended to spur economic growth while about 67 percent went towards social welfare benefits .
" the fact that the transfers increased rather than decreased in the last few years shocked us , " blum told the newspaper .
another study released this week showed that the eastern german economy has caught up with the west faster than expected .
the private cologne-based iw institute said that gross domestic product per capita , a key indicator of living standards , has risen in the east from 30 percent of that in the west in 1991 to 70 percent today .
the institute said that by 2020 , average gdp per capita in the east could reach 80 percent of that in the west and that the most prosperous eastern states could have overtaken the poorest of their western counterparts. rb / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the last two decades , we have neglected to invest in roads and rail " in the west , ramsauer told the newspaper , referring to the reunification of east and west germany 20 years ago .
" now the time has come to make up for what we have failed to do , " he added .
he said there was a " considerable backlog " of important construction projects in western germany .
ramsauer said thanks to a 5.5 percent solidarity tax on german taxpayers and hundreds of billions of euros in state funding , roads and other infrastructure in the former east germany were no longer in disrepair but had instead been transformed into some of the finest in the world .
the transport minister added that this progress was sometimes achieved at the cost of infrastructure in western germany .
ramsauer ’ s comments have drawn negative reactions from some other members of the governing coalition , especially as they came amid celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the wall tumbling and national unification .
cornelia pieper , deputy chairman of the free democrats – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative bloc – criticized ramsauer ’ s comments as a " tasteless contribution . "
she was quoted as telling the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper that the minister had made the comments " in complete disregard for reality and has unnecessarily disturbed this day of joy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minister has called for stepping up investment in infrastructure in the west ‘ 1.3 trillion euros transferred to former east germany ’ a new study out on sunday showed that reunited germany transferred some 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 trillion -rrb- to prop up the former communist east in the years following the berlin wall 's fall .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- said the huge sum spent between 1991 and 2005 , had largely gone toward social welfare payments for easterners .
iwh president ulrich blum said only about 10 percent of the subsidies had gone to measures intended to spur economic growth while about 67 percent went towards social welfare benefits .
" the fact that the transfers increased rather than decreased in the last few years shocked us , " blum told the newspaper .
another study released this week showed that the eastern german economy has caught up with the west faster than expected .
the private cologne-based iw institute said that gross domestic product per capita , a key indicator of living standards , has risen in the east from 30 percent of that in the west in 1991 to 70 percent today .
the institute said that by 2020 , average gdp per capita in the east could reach 80 percent of that in the west and that the most prosperous eastern states could have overtaken the poorest of their western counterparts. rb / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the last two decades , we have neglected to invest in roads and rail " in the west , ramsauer told the newspaper , referring to the reunification of east and west germany 20 years ago .
" now the time has come to make up for what we have failed to do , " he added .
he said there was a " considerable backlog " of important construction projects in western germany .
ramsauer said thanks to a 5.5 percent solidarity tax on german taxpayers and hundreds of billions of euros in state funding , roads and other infrastructure in the former east germany were no longer in disrepair but had instead been transformed into some of the finest in the world .
the transport minister added that this progress was sometimes achieved at the cost of infrastructure in western germany .
ramsauer ’ s comments have drawn negative reactions from some other members of the governing coalition , especially as they came amid celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the wall tumbling and national unification .
cornelia pieper , deputy chairman of the free democrats – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative bloc – criticized ramsauer ’ s comments as a " tasteless contribution . "
she was quoted as telling the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper that the minister had made the comments " in complete disregard for reality and has unnecessarily disturbed this day of joy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minister has called for stepping up investment in infrastructure in the west ‘ 1.3 trillion euros transferred to former east germany ’ a new study out on sunday showed that reunited germany transferred some 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 trillion -rrb- to prop up the former communist east in the years following the berlin wall 's fall .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- said the huge sum spent between 1991 and 2005 , had largely gone toward social welfare payments for easterners .
iwh president ulrich blum said only about 10 percent of the subsidies had gone to measures intended to spur economic growth while about 67 percent went towards social welfare benefits .
" the fact that the transfers increased rather than decreased in the last few years shocked us , " blum told the newspaper .
another study released this week showed that the eastern german economy has caught up with the west faster than expected .
the private cologne-based iw institute said that gross domestic product per capita , a key indicator of living standards , has risen in the east from 30 percent of that in the west in 1991 to 70 percent today .
the institute said that by 2020 , average gdp per capita in the east could reach 80 percent of that in the west and that the most prosperous eastern states could have overtaken the poorest of their western counterparts. rb / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

of those questioned , 28 percent said they approved of additional funding .
the german government has signaled it would be prepared to provide financial aid to opel , if gm paid back the portions of the transition loan it has already used .

the head of germany 's employer 's association , dieter hundt , has rejected further aid to opel , arguing that many small and mid-sized businesses in germany had been hit just as badly by the economic crisis .
hundt said if any aid is provided it should be done through the already existing " deutschlandfond " , which is open to all struggling businesses .
meanwhile , klaus franz , the head of opel 's works council which represents employees , urged general motors to appoint a german executive to manage its european operations .
gm has hinted that it is looking for a german after the resignation of its european ceo , carl-peter forster , who had been an outspoken supporter of the magna deal .

9 , 1989 gdr central committee spokesman guenter schabowski unintentionally announced that citizens could travel to west germany immediately .
it was the beginning of the end for east germany . guenter schabowski 's press conference on november 9 , 1989 was a fairly dull affair for most of its duration , according to those present .
but a question by an italian journalist right at the end turned it into one of european history 's most memorable events .
schabowski was asked just before 7 p.m. about when a new law permitting gdr citizens more freedom of travel would go into effect .
schabowski famously told the journalist : " as far as i know , that goes into effect now , immediately . "
since television viewers in both east and west germany were following the live press conference , his comments electrified east germans and eventually led to a redrawing of the european map .
immediately following the remark , gdr citizens rushed to the border separating east and west berlin , wanting to visit the western part of the city .
the gdr border guards were unaware of the press conference , and , taken aback by the crowds gathering in front of them , made repeated calls to their superiors asking for guidance .
they successfully prevented citizens from crossing the border for three hours .
but later in the evening , the guards relented and opened the borders .
people were able to cross freely from east to west for the first time since the wall was erected on august 21 , 1961 .
" we are the people ! "
in the months prior to schabowski 's press conference , thousands of gdr citizens had taken to the streets demanding political reform .
the so-called " monday demonstrators " in the eastern city of leipzig had drawn special attention for their protests .
shouts by demonstrators of " we are the people ! " became commonplace , followed by " gorbi !
gorbi ! " – calls directed at mikhail gorbachev , the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union .
since 1985 , gorbachev had been implementing reforms in his country , and germans living in the gdr hoped to see his ideas adopted there as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70,000 protestors took to the streets on october 9 , 1989 in leipzig however , the hardline government under gdr leader erich honecker was not interested in reform , and the government 's refusal to change ultimately led to its own demise .
on october 18 , 1989 , honecker was forced to step down .
he was replaced by egon krenz as head of state , but even this shift could not prevent the gdr 's collapse .
a november 4 protest at berlin 's alexanderplatz attracted 500,000 people , making it clear that a change of leadership would not win the people 's trust .
when the berlin wall opened five days later , demands for reunification of east and west germany grew louder .
german unity and european integration in light of the increasing support for reunification , western diplomats travelled to the gdr a few weeks after the wall 's opening .
france and england in particular reacted with mistrust to the prospect of the large and economically powerful german state that reunification would create in the heart of europe .
if they could not stop reunification entirely , the two countries at least hoped to apply political sanctions on germany .
helmut kohl , then-chancellor of germany , kept their position in mind as he delivered a speech in front of the ruins of dresden 's " frauenkirche " cathedral that drew worldwide attention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and francois mitterrand negotiated on the future of the gdr kohl declared that german unity would only be possible in the context of a more unified europe generally .
he said german and european unification were just two sides of the same coin .
his speech garnered thunderous applause from the gdr citizens in attendance .
nevertheless , french president francois mitterrand travelled to the gdr two days later in an attempt to prevent west germany from annexing the east .
by early 1990 , the international community watched closely the process of german reunification to ensure that the interests of germans as well as of the four conquering allied powers from world war ii -lrb- england , france , the us and the soviet union -rrb- were respected .
german negotiators worked out the conditions of a german reunification internally , while both west and east german officials consulted with the four powers about the international ramifications of their proposal .
this so-called " 2 plus 4 " process -lrb- representing the two german states and the four allied powers -rrb- concluded with a declaration of sovereignty for germany on september 12 , 1990 .
german negotiations had already resulted in a contract that specified all aspects of the new relationship between east and west germany on august 31 , 1990 .
on october 3 , 1990 , the former east german states officially joined the federal republic of germany .
the date marked the end of the gdr and the beginning of a reunified federal republic .

9 , 1989 gdr central committee spokesman guenter schabowski unintentionally announced that citizens could travel to west germany immediately .
it was the beginning of the end for east germany . guenter schabowski 's press conference on november 9 , 1989 was a fairly dull affair for most of its duration , according to those present .
but a question by an italian journalist right at the end turned it into one of european history 's most memorable events .
schabowski was asked just before 7 p.m. about when a new law permitting gdr citizens more freedom of travel would go into effect .
schabowski famously told the journalist : " as far as i know , that goes into effect now , immediately . "
since television viewers in both east and west germany were following the live press conference , his comments electrified east germans and eventually led to a redrawing of the european map .
immediately following the remark , gdr citizens rushed to the border separating east and west berlin , wanting to visit the western part of the city .
the gdr border guards were unaware of the press conference , and , taken aback by the crowds gathering in front of them , made repeated calls to their superiors asking for guidance .
they successfully prevented citizens from crossing the border for three hours .
but later in the evening , the guards relented and opened the borders .
people were able to cross freely from east to west for the first time since the wall was erected on august 21 , 1961 .
" we are the people ! "
in the months prior to schabowski 's press conference , thousands of gdr citizens had taken to the streets demanding political reform .
the so-called " monday demonstrators " in the eastern city of leipzig had drawn special attention for their protests .
shouts by demonstrators of " we are the people ! " became commonplace , followed by " gorbi !
gorbi ! " – calls directed at mikhail gorbachev , the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union .
since 1985 , gorbachev had been implementing reforms in his country , and germans living in the gdr hoped to see his ideas adopted there as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70,000 protestors took to the streets on october 9 , 1989 in leipzig however , the hardline government under gdr leader erich honecker was not interested in reform , and the government 's refusal to change ultimately led to its own demise .
on october 18 , 1989 , honecker was forced to step down .
he was replaced by egon krenz as head of state , but even this shift could not prevent the gdr 's collapse .
a november 4 protest at berlin 's alexanderplatz attracted 500,000 people , making it clear that a change of leadership would not win the people 's trust .
when the berlin wall opened five days later , demands for reunification of east and west germany grew louder .
german unity and european integration in light of the increasing support for reunification , western diplomats travelled to the gdr a few weeks after the wall 's opening .
france and england in particular reacted with mistrust to the prospect of the large and economically powerful german state that reunification would create in the heart of europe .
if they could not stop reunification entirely , the two countries at least hoped to apply political sanctions on germany .
helmut kohl , then-chancellor of germany , kept their position in mind as he delivered a speech in front of the ruins of dresden 's " frauenkirche " cathedral that drew worldwide attention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and francois mitterrand negotiated on the future of the gdr kohl declared that german unity would only be possible in the context of a more unified europe generally .
he said german and european unification were just two sides of the same coin .
his speech garnered thunderous applause from the gdr citizens in attendance .
nevertheless , french president francois mitterrand travelled to the gdr two days later in an attempt to prevent west germany from annexing the east .
by early 1990 , the international community watched closely the process of german reunification to ensure that the interests of germans as well as of the four conquering allied powers from world war ii -lrb- england , france , the us and the soviet union -rrb- were respected .
german negotiators worked out the conditions of a german reunification internally , while both west and east german officials consulted with the four powers about the international ramifications of their proposal .
this so-called " 2 plus 4 " process -lrb- representing the two german states and the four allied powers -rrb- concluded with a declaration of sovereignty for germany on september 12 , 1990 .
german negotiations had already resulted in a contract that specified all aspects of the new relationship between east and west germany on august 31 , 1990 .
on october 3 , 1990 , the former east german states officially joined the federal republic of germany .
the date marked the end of the gdr and the beginning of a reunified federal republic .

" in the last two decades , we have neglected to invest in roads and rail " in the west , ramsauer told the newspaper , referring to the reunification of east and west germany 20 years ago .
" now the time has come to make up for what we have failed to do , " he added .
he said there was a " considerable backlog " of important construction projects in western germany .
ramsauer said thanks to a 5.5 percent solidarity tax on german taxpayers and hundreds of billions of euros in state funding , roads and other infrastructure in the former east germany were no longer in disrepair but had instead been transformed into some of the finest in the world .
the transport minister added that this progress was sometimes achieved at the cost of infrastructure in western germany .
ramsauer ’ s comments have drawn negative reactions from some other members of the governing coalition , especially as they came amid celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the wall tumbling and national unification .
cornelia pieper , deputy chairman of the free democrats – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative bloc – criticized ramsauer ’ s comments as a " tasteless contribution . "
she was quoted as telling the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper that the minister had made the comments " in complete disregard for reality and has unnecessarily disturbed this day of joy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minister has called for stepping up investment in infrastructure in the west ‘ 1.3 trillion euros transferred to former east germany ’ a new study out on sunday showed that reunited germany transferred some 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 trillion -rrb- to prop up the former communist east in the years following the berlin wall 's fall .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- said the huge sum spent between 1991 and 2005 , had largely gone toward social welfare payments for easterners .
iwh president ulrich blum said only about 10 percent of the subsidies had gone to measures intended to spur economic growth while about 67 percent went towards social welfare benefits .
" the fact that the transfers increased rather than decreased in the last few years shocked us , " blum told the newspaper .
another study released this week showed that the eastern german economy has caught up with the west faster than expected .
the private cologne-based iw institute said that gross domestic product per capita , a key indicator of living standards , has risen in the east from 30 percent of that in the west in 1991 to 70 percent today .
the institute said that by 2020 , average gdp per capita in the east could reach 80 percent of that in the west and that the most prosperous eastern states could have overtaken the poorest of their western counterparts. rb / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of germany 's employer 's association , dieter hundt , has rejected further aid to opel , arguing that many small and mid-sized businesses in germany had been hit just as badly by the economic crisis .
hundt said if any aid is provided it should be done through the already existing " deutschlandfond " , which is open to all struggling businesses .
meanwhile , klaus franz , the head of opel 's works council which represents employees , urged general motors to appoint a german executive to manage its european operations .

9 , 1989 gdr central committee spokesman guenter schabowski unintentionally announced that citizens could travel to west germany immediately .
it was the beginning of the end for east germany . guenter schabowski 's press conference on november 9 , 1989 was a fairly dull affair for most of its duration , according to those present .
but a question by an italian journalist right at the end turned it into one of european history 's most memorable events .
schabowski was asked just before 7 p.m. about when a new law permitting gdr citizens more freedom of travel would go into effect .
schabowski famously told the journalist : " as far as i know , that goes into effect now , immediately . "
since television viewers in both east and west germany were following the live press conference , his comments electrified east germans and eventually led to a redrawing of the european map .
immediately following the remark , gdr citizens rushed to the border separating east and west berlin , wanting to visit the western part of the city .
the gdr border guards were unaware of the press conference , and , taken aback by the crowds gathering in front of them , made repeated calls to their superiors asking for guidance .
they successfully prevented citizens from crossing the border for three hours .
but later in the evening , the guards relented and opened the borders .
people were able to cross freely from east to west for the first time since the wall was erected on august 21 , 1961 .
" we are the people ! "
in the months prior to schabowski 's press conference , thousands of gdr citizens had taken to the streets demanding political reform .
the so-called " monday demonstrators " in the eastern city of leipzig had drawn special attention for their protests .
shouts by demonstrators of " we are the people ! " became commonplace , followed by " gorbi !
gorbi ! " – calls directed at mikhail gorbachev , the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union .
since 1985 , gorbachev had been implementing reforms in his country , and germans living in the gdr hoped to see his ideas adopted there as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70,000 protestors took to the streets on october 9 , 1989 in leipzig however , the hardline government under gdr leader erich honecker was not interested in reform , and the government 's refusal to change ultimately led to its own demise .
on october 18 , 1989 , honecker was forced to step down .
he was replaced by egon krenz as head of state , but even this shift could not prevent the gdr 's collapse .
a november 4 protest at berlin 's alexanderplatz attracted 500,000 people , making it clear that a change of leadership would not win the people 's trust .
when the berlin wall opened five days later , demands for reunification of east and west germany grew louder .
german unity and european integration in light of the increasing support for reunification , western diplomats travelled to the gdr a few weeks after the wall 's opening .
france and england in particular reacted with mistrust to the prospect of the large and economically powerful german state that reunification would create in the heart of europe .
if they could not stop reunification entirely , the two countries at least hoped to apply political sanctions on germany .
helmut kohl , then-chancellor of germany , kept their position in mind as he delivered a speech in front of the ruins of dresden 's " frauenkirche " cathedral that drew worldwide attention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and francois mitterrand negotiated on the future of the gdr kohl declared that german unity would only be possible in the context of a more unified europe generally .
he said german and european unification were just two sides of the same coin .
his speech garnered thunderous applause from the gdr citizens in attendance .
nevertheless , french president francois mitterrand travelled to the gdr two days later in an attempt to prevent west germany from annexing the east .
by early 1990 , the international community watched closely the process of german reunification to ensure that the interests of germans as well as of the four conquering allied powers from world war ii -lrb- england , france , the us and the soviet union -rrb- were respected .
german negotiators worked out the conditions of a german reunification internally , while both west and east german officials consulted with the four powers about the international ramifications of their proposal .
this so-called " 2 plus 4 " process -lrb- representing the two german states and the four allied powers -rrb- concluded with a declaration of sovereignty for germany on september 12 , 1990 .
german negotiations had already resulted in a contract that specified all aspects of the new relationship between east and west germany on august 31 , 1990 .
on october 3 , 1990 , the former east german states officially joined the federal republic of germany .
the date marked the end of the gdr and the beginning of a reunified federal republic .

on october 18 , 1989 , honecker was forced to step down .
he was replaced by egon krenz as head of state , but even this shift could not prevent the gdr 's collapse .
a november 4 protest at berlin 's alexanderplatz attracted 500,000 people , making it clear that a change of leadership would not win the people 's trust .
when the berlin wall opened five days later , demands for reunification of east and west germany grew louder .
german unity and european integration in light of the increasing support for reunification , western diplomats travelled to the gdr a few weeks after the wall 's opening .
france and england in particular reacted with mistrust to the prospect of the large and economically powerful german state that reunification would create in the heart of europe .
if they could not stop reunification entirely , the two countries at least hoped to apply political sanctions on germany .
helmut kohl , then-chancellor of germany , kept their position in mind as he delivered a speech in front of the ruins of dresden 's " frauenkirche " cathedral that drew worldwide attention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and francois mitterrand negotiated on the future of the gdr kohl declared that german unity would only be possible in the context of a more unified europe generally .
he said german and european unification were just two sides of the same coin .
his speech garnered thunderous applause from the gdr citizens in attendance .
nevertheless , french president francois mitterrand travelled to the gdr two days later in an attempt to prevent west germany from annexing the east .
by early 1990 , the international community watched closely the process of german reunification to ensure that the interests of germans as well as of the four conquering allied powers from world war ii -lrb- england , france , the us and the soviet union -rrb- were respected .
german negotiators worked out the conditions of a german reunification internally , while both west and east german officials consulted with the four powers about the international ramifications of their proposal .
this so-called " 2 plus 4 " process -lrb- representing the two german states and the four allied powers -rrb- concluded with a declaration of sovereignty for germany on september 12 , 1990 .
german negotiations had already resulted in a contract that specified all aspects of the new relationship between east and west germany on august 31 , 1990 .
on october 3 , 1990 , the former east german states officially joined the federal republic of germany .
the date marked the end of the gdr and the beginning of a reunified federal republic .

" in the last two decades , we have neglected to invest in roads and rail " in the west , ramsauer told the newspaper , referring to the reunification of east and west germany 20 years ago .
" now the time has come to make up for what we have failed to do , " he added .
he said there was a " considerable backlog " of important construction projects in western germany .
ramsauer said thanks to a 5.5 percent solidarity tax on german taxpayers and hundreds of billions of euros in state funding , roads and other infrastructure in the former east germany were no longer in disrepair but had instead been transformed into some of the finest in the world .
the transport minister added that this progress was sometimes achieved at the cost of infrastructure in western germany .
ramsauer ’ s comments have drawn negative reactions from some other members of the governing coalition , especially as they came amid celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the wall tumbling and national unification .
cornelia pieper , deputy chairman of the free democrats – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative bloc – criticized ramsauer ’ s comments as a " tasteless contribution . "
she was quoted as telling the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper that the minister had made the comments " in complete disregard for reality and has unnecessarily disturbed this day of joy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minister has called for stepping up investment in infrastructure in the west ‘ 1.3 trillion euros transferred to former east germany ’ a new study out on sunday showed that reunited germany transferred some 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 trillion -rrb- to prop up the former communist east in the years following the berlin wall 's fall .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- said the huge sum spent between 1991 and 2005 , had largely gone toward social welfare payments for easterners .
iwh president ulrich blum said only about 10 percent of the subsidies had gone to measures intended to spur economic growth while about 67 percent went towards social welfare benefits .
" the fact that the transfers increased rather than decreased in the last few years shocked us , " blum told the newspaper .
another study released this week showed that the eastern german economy has caught up with the west faster than expected .
the private cologne-based iw institute said that gross domestic product per capita , a key indicator of living standards , has risen in the east from 30 percent of that in the west in 1991 to 70 percent today .
the institute said that by 2020 , average gdp per capita in the east could reach 80 percent of that in the west and that the most prosperous eastern states could have overtaken the poorest of their western counterparts. rb / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

who should pay for environmental protection ?
that question is proving difficult to answer .
the upcoming climate conference in copenhagen could fail , warns germany 's development minister , dirk niebel . one month before the world climate conference in copenhagen , federal development minister dirk niebel is doubtful about the chances for agreement on new climate standards .
" the national government wants this to succeed , " niebel told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday .
" but there is real doubt about whether it is going to be possible at this time . "
niebel noted that even some sort of resolution outlining core goals for an international accord could be considered a success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel is worried that a new accord to replace the kyoto protocol may not be found climate protection gets expensive the climate summit in copenhagen is supposed to come up with a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
however , industrial and developing nations continue to argue over which countries must reduce their emissions and who should bear the costs of carbon dioxide reduction measures .
according to eu estimates , the earth 's poorest nations will need about 100 billion euros per year until 2020 .
about 22 to 50 billion euros of that will come from the public purse .
the eu has indicated that it is prepared to cover about a third of the costs .
but an agreement among all the industrialized countries is still pending .
" if there is n't an agreement on financing , if there is n't an agreement about contributions to make sure we can deal with this problem , then the copenhagen agreement is going to be much , much more difficult , " british finance minister alistair darling said on saturday , after finance ministers from the g20 countries met in st. andrews , scotland .
developing countries protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drought and rising temperatures are a growing problem in africa the eu is prepared to unilaterally reduce its emissions by 20 percent by 2020 - and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries join in .
according to an assessment by the copenhagen climate council , developed countries must reduce their emissions by 25 to 40 percent in order to hold an increase in global temperatures to two degrees .
for the developing countries , these promises are not enough .
during pre-copenhagen preparatory talks , held earlier this month in barcelona , 50 african countries temporarily walked out of the proceedings to protest what they saw as foot-dragging by the wealthier countries .
these nations , says the so-called " group of 77 " developing and threshhold countries , must reduce their emissions by at least 40 percent by 2020. svs / ap / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

who should pay for environmental protection ?
that question is proving difficult to answer .
the upcoming climate conference in copenhagen could fail , warns germany 's development minister , dirk niebel . one month before the world climate conference in copenhagen , federal development minister dirk niebel is doubtful about the chances for agreement on new climate standards .
" the national government wants this to succeed , " niebel told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday .
" but there is real doubt about whether it is going to be possible at this time . "
niebel noted that even some sort of resolution outlining core goals for an international accord could be considered a success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel is worried that a new accord to replace the kyoto protocol may not be found climate protection gets expensive the climate summit in copenhagen is supposed to come up with a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
however , industrial and developing nations continue to argue over which countries must reduce their emissions and who should bear the costs of carbon dioxide reduction measures .
according to eu estimates , the earth 's poorest nations will need about 100 billion euros per year until 2020 .
about 22 to 50 billion euros of that will come from the public purse .
the eu has indicated that it is prepared to cover about a third of the costs .
but an agreement among all the industrialized countries is still pending .
" if there is n't an agreement on financing , if there is n't an agreement about contributions to make sure we can deal with this problem , then the copenhagen agreement is going to be much , much more difficult , " british finance minister alistair darling said on saturday , after finance ministers from the g20 countries met in st. andrews , scotland .
developing countries protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drought and rising temperatures are a growing problem in africa the eu is prepared to unilaterally reduce its emissions by 20 percent by 2020 - and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries join in .
according to an assessment by the copenhagen climate council , developed countries must reduce their emissions by 25 to 40 percent in order to hold an increase in global temperatures to two degrees .
for the developing countries , these promises are not enough .
during pre-copenhagen preparatory talks , held earlier this month in barcelona , 50 african countries temporarily walked out of the proceedings to protest what they saw as foot-dragging by the wealthier countries .

9 , 1989 gdr central committee spokesman guenter schabowski unintentionally announced that citizens could travel to west germany immediately .
it was the beginning of the end for east germany . guenter schabowski 's press conference on november 9 , 1989 was a fairly dull affair for most of its duration , according to those present .
but a question by an italian journalist right at the end turned it into one of european history 's most memorable events .
schabowski was asked just before 7 p.m. about when a new law permitting gdr citizens more freedom of travel would go into effect .
schabowski famously told the journalist : " as far as i know , that goes into effect now , immediately . "
since television viewers in both east and west germany were following the live press conference , his comments electrified east germans and eventually led to a redrawing of the european map .
immediately following the remark , gdr citizens rushed to the border separating east and west berlin , wanting to visit the western part of the city .
the gdr border guards were unaware of the press conference , and , taken aback by the crowds gathering in front of them , made repeated calls to their superiors asking for guidance .
they successfully prevented citizens from crossing the border for three hours .
but later in the evening , the guards relented and opened the borders .
people were able to cross freely from east to west for the first time since the wall was erected on august 21 , 1961 .
" we are the people ! "
in the months prior to schabowski 's press conference , thousands of gdr citizens had taken to the streets demanding political reform .
the so-called " monday demonstrators " in the eastern city of leipzig had drawn special attention for their protests .
shouts by demonstrators of " we are the people ! " became commonplace , followed by " gorbi !
gorbi ! " – calls directed at mikhail gorbachev , the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union .
since 1985 , gorbachev had been implementing reforms in his country , and germans living in the gdr hoped to see his ideas adopted there as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70,000 protestors took to the streets on october 9 , 1989 in leipzig however , the hardline government under gdr leader erich honecker was not interested in reform , and the government 's refusal to change ultimately led to its own demise .
on october 18 , 1989 , honecker was forced to step down .
he was replaced by egon krenz as head of state , but even this shift could not prevent the gdr 's collapse .
a november 4 protest at berlin 's alexanderplatz attracted 500,000 people , making it clear that a change of leadership would not win the people 's trust .
when the berlin wall opened five days later , demands for reunification of east and west germany grew louder .
german unity and european integration in light of the increasing support for reunification , western diplomats travelled to the gdr a few weeks after the wall 's opening .
france and england in particular reacted with mistrust to the prospect of the large and economically powerful german state that reunification would create in the heart of europe .
if they could not stop reunification entirely , the two countries at least hoped to apply political sanctions on germany .
helmut kohl , then-chancellor of germany , kept their position in mind as he delivered a speech in front of the ruins of dresden 's " frauenkirche " cathedral that drew worldwide attention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and francois mitterrand negotiated on the future of the gdr kohl declared that german unity would only be possible in the context of a more unified europe generally .
he said german and european unification were just two sides of the same coin .
his speech garnered thunderous applause from the gdr citizens in attendance .
nevertheless , french president francois mitterrand travelled to the gdr two days later in an attempt to prevent west germany from annexing the east .
by early 1990 , the international community watched closely the process of german reunification to ensure that the interests of germans as well as of the four conquering allied powers from world war ii -lrb- england , france , the us and the soviet union -rrb- were respected .
german negotiators worked out the conditions of a german reunification internally , while both west and east german officials consulted with the four powers about the international ramifications of their proposal .
this so-called " 2 plus 4 " process -lrb- representing the two german states and the four allied powers -rrb- concluded with a declaration of sovereignty for germany on september 12 , 1990 .
german negotiations had already resulted in a contract that specified all aspects of the new relationship between east and west germany on august 31 , 1990 .
on october 3 , 1990 , the former east german states officially joined the federal republic of germany .
the date marked the end of the gdr and the beginning of a reunified federal republic .

9 , 1989 gdr central committee spokesman guenter schabowski unintentionally announced that citizens could travel to west germany immediately .
it was the beginning of the end for east germany . guenter schabowski 's press conference on november 9 , 1989 was a fairly dull affair for most of its duration , according to those present .
but a question by an italian journalist right at the end turned it into one of european history 's most memorable events .
schabowski was asked just before 7 p.m. about when a new law permitting gdr citizens more freedom of travel would go into effect .
schabowski famously told the journalist : " as far as i know , that goes into effect now , immediately . "
since television viewers in both east and west germany were following the live press conference , his comments electrified east germans and eventually led to a redrawing of the european map .
immediately following the remark , gdr citizens rushed to the border separating east and west berlin , wanting to visit the western part of the city .
the gdr border guards were unaware of the press conference , and , taken aback by the crowds gathering in front of them , made repeated calls to their superiors asking for guidance .
they successfully prevented citizens from crossing the border for three hours .
but later in the evening , the guards relented and opened the borders .
people were able to cross freely from east to west for the first time since the wall was erected on august 21 , 1961 .
" we are the people ! "
in the months prior to schabowski 's press conference , thousands of gdr citizens had taken to the streets demanding political reform .
the so-called " monday demonstrators " in the eastern city of leipzig had drawn special attention for their protests .
shouts by demonstrators of " we are the people ! " became commonplace , followed by " gorbi !
gorbi ! " – calls directed at mikhail gorbachev , the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union .
since 1985 , gorbachev had been implementing reforms in his country , and germans living in the gdr hoped to see his ideas adopted there as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70,000 protestors took to the streets on october 9 , 1989 in leipzig however , the hardline government under gdr leader erich honecker was not interested in reform , and the government 's refusal to change ultimately led to its own demise .
on october 18 , 1989 , honecker was forced to step down .
he was replaced by egon krenz as head of state , but even this shift could not prevent the gdr 's collapse .
a november 4 protest at berlin 's alexanderplatz attracted 500,000 people , making it clear that a change of leadership would not win the people 's trust .
when the berlin wall opened five days later , demands for reunification of east and west germany grew louder .
german unity and european integration in light of the increasing support for reunification , western diplomats travelled to the gdr a few weeks after the wall 's opening .
france and england in particular reacted with mistrust to the prospect of the large and economically powerful german state that reunification would create in the heart of europe .
if they could not stop reunification entirely , the two countries at least hoped to apply political sanctions on germany .
helmut kohl , then-chancellor of germany , kept their position in mind as he delivered a speech in front of the ruins of dresden 's " frauenkirche " cathedral that drew worldwide attention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and francois mitterrand negotiated on the future of the gdr kohl declared that german unity would only be possible in the context of a more unified europe generally .
he said german and european unification were just two sides of the same coin .
his speech garnered thunderous applause from the gdr citizens in attendance .
nevertheless , french president francois mitterrand travelled to the gdr two days later in an attempt to prevent west germany from annexing the east .
by early 1990 , the international community watched closely the process of german reunification to ensure that the interests of germans as well as of the four conquering allied powers from world war ii -lrb- england , france , the us and the soviet union -rrb- were respected .
german negotiators worked out the conditions of a german reunification internally , while both west and east german officials consulted with the four powers about the international ramifications of their proposal .
this so-called " 2 plus 4 " process -lrb- representing the two german states and the four allied powers -rrb- concluded with a declaration of sovereignty for germany on september 12 , 1990 .
german negotiations had already resulted in a contract that specified all aspects of the new relationship between east and west germany on august 31 , 1990 .
on october 3 , 1990 , the former east german states officially joined the federal republic of germany .
the date marked the end of the gdr and the beginning of a reunified federal republic .

who should pay for environmental protection ?
that question is proving difficult to answer .
the upcoming climate conference in copenhagen could fail , warns germany 's development minister , dirk niebel . one month before the world climate conference in copenhagen , federal development minister dirk niebel is doubtful about the chances for agreement on new climate standards .
" the national government wants this to succeed , " niebel told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday .
" but there is real doubt about whether it is going to be possible at this time . "
niebel noted that even some sort of resolution outlining core goals for an international accord could be considered a success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel is worried that a new accord to replace the kyoto protocol may not be found climate protection gets expensive the climate summit in copenhagen is supposed to come up with a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
however , industrial and developing nations continue to argue over which countries must reduce their emissions and who should bear the costs of carbon dioxide reduction measures .
according to eu estimates , the earth 's poorest nations will need about 100 billion euros per year until 2020 .
about 22 to 50 billion euros of that will come from the public purse .
the eu has indicated that it is prepared to cover about a third of the costs .
but an agreement among all the industrialized countries is still pending .
" if there is n't an agreement on financing , if there is n't an agreement about contributions to make sure we can deal with this problem , then the copenhagen agreement is going to be much , much more difficult , " british finance minister alistair darling said on saturday , after finance ministers from the g20 countries met in st. andrews , scotland .
developing countries protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drought and rising temperatures are a growing problem in africa the eu is prepared to unilaterally reduce its emissions by 20 percent by 2020 - and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries join in .
according to an assessment by the copenhagen climate council , developed countries must reduce their emissions by 25 to 40 percent in order to hold an increase in global temperatures to two degrees .
for the developing countries , these promises are not enough .
during pre-copenhagen preparatory talks , held earlier this month in barcelona , 50 african countries temporarily walked out of the proceedings to protest what they saw as foot-dragging by the wealthier countries .
these nations , says the so-called " group of 77 " developing and threshhold countries , must reduce their emissions by at least 40 percent by 2020. svs / ap / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a question by an italian journalist right at the end turned it into one of european history 's most memorable events .
schabowski was asked just before 7 p.m. about when a new law permitting gdr citizens more freedom of travel would go into effect .

in a speech , she honored all those who became victims of the east german regime , and also offered thanks to those who supported east germans in their struggle to live in a free society .
she also praised gorbachev for his role in reforming the soviet union .

" in the last two decades , we have neglected to invest in roads and rail " in the west , ramsauer told the newspaper , referring to the reunification of east and west germany 20 years ago .
" now the time has come to make up for what we have failed to do , " he added .
he said there was a " considerable backlog " of important construction projects in western germany .
ramsauer said thanks to a 5.5 percent solidarity tax on german taxpayers and hundreds of billions of euros in state funding , roads and other infrastructure in the former east germany were no longer in disrepair but had instead been transformed into some of the finest in the world .
the transport minister added that this progress was sometimes achieved at the cost of infrastructure in western germany .
ramsauer ’ s comments have drawn negative reactions from some other members of the governing coalition , especially as they came amid celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the wall tumbling and national unification .
cornelia pieper , deputy chairman of the free democrats – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative bloc – criticized ramsauer ’ s comments as a " tasteless contribution . "
she was quoted as telling the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper that the minister had made the comments " in complete disregard for reality and has unnecessarily disturbed this day of joy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minister has called for stepping up investment in infrastructure in the west ‘ 1.3 trillion euros transferred to former east germany ’ a new study out on sunday showed that reunited germany transferred some 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 trillion -rrb- to prop up the former communist east in the years following the berlin wall 's fall .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- said the huge sum spent between 1991 and 2005 , had largely gone toward social welfare payments for easterners .
iwh president ulrich blum said only about 10 percent of the subsidies had gone to measures intended to spur economic growth while about 67 percent went towards social welfare benefits .
" the fact that the transfers increased rather than decreased in the last few years shocked us , " blum told the newspaper .
another study released this week showed that the eastern german economy has caught up with the west faster than expected .
the private cologne-based iw institute said that gross domestic product per capita , a key indicator of living standards , has risen in the east from 30 percent of that in the west in 1991 to 70 percent today .
the institute said that by 2020 , average gdp per capita in the east could reach 80 percent of that in the west and that the most prosperous eastern states could have overtaken the poorest of their western counterparts. rb / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the last two decades , we have neglected to invest in roads and rail " in the west , ramsauer told the newspaper , referring to the reunification of east and west germany 20 years ago .
" now the time has come to make up for what we have failed to do , " he added .
he said there was a " considerable backlog " of important construction projects in western germany .
ramsauer said thanks to a 5.5 percent solidarity tax on german taxpayers and hundreds of billions of euros in state funding , roads and other infrastructure in the former east germany were no longer in disrepair but had instead been transformed into some of the finest in the world .
the transport minister added that this progress was sometimes achieved at the cost of infrastructure in western germany .
ramsauer ’ s comments have drawn negative reactions from some other members of the governing coalition , especially as they came amid celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the wall tumbling and national unification .
cornelia pieper , deputy chairman of the free democrats – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative bloc – criticized ramsauer ’ s comments as a " tasteless contribution . "
she was quoted as telling the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper that the minister had made the comments " in complete disregard for reality and has unnecessarily disturbed this day of joy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minister has called for stepping up investment in infrastructure in the west ‘ 1.3 trillion euros transferred to former east germany ’ a new study out on sunday showed that reunited germany transferred some 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 trillion -rrb- to prop up the former communist east in the years following the berlin wall 's fall .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- said the huge sum spent between 1991 and 2005 , had largely gone toward social welfare payments for easterners .
iwh president ulrich blum said only about 10 percent of the subsidies had gone to measures intended to spur economic growth while about 67 percent went towards social welfare benefits .
" the fact that the transfers increased rather than decreased in the last few years shocked us , " blum told the newspaper .
another study released this week showed that the eastern german economy has caught up with the west faster than expected .
the private cologne-based iw institute said that gross domestic product per capita , a key indicator of living standards , has risen in the east from 30 percent of that in the west in 1991 to 70 percent today .
the institute said that by 2020 , average gdp per capita in the east could reach 80 percent of that in the west and that the most prosperous eastern states could have overtaken the poorest of their western counterparts. rb / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the last two decades , we have neglected to invest in roads and rail " in the west , ramsauer told the newspaper , referring to the reunification of east and west germany 20 years ago .
" now the time has come to make up for what we have failed to do , " he added .
he said there was a " considerable backlog " of important construction projects in western germany .
ramsauer said thanks to a 5.5 percent solidarity tax on german taxpayers and hundreds of billions of euros in state funding , roads and other infrastructure in the former east germany were no longer in disrepair but had instead been transformed into some of the finest in the world .
the transport minister added that this progress was sometimes achieved at the cost of infrastructure in western germany .
ramsauer ’ s comments have drawn negative reactions from some other members of the governing coalition , especially as they came amid celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the wall tumbling and national unification .
cornelia pieper , deputy chairman of the free democrats – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative bloc – criticized ramsauer ’ s comments as a " tasteless contribution . "
she was quoted as telling the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper that the minister had made the comments " in complete disregard for reality and has unnecessarily disturbed this day of joy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minister has called for stepping up investment in infrastructure in the west ‘ 1.3 trillion euros transferred to former east germany ’ a new study out on sunday showed that reunited germany transferred some 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 trillion -rrb- to prop up the former communist east in the years following the berlin wall 's fall .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- said the huge sum spent between 1991 and 2005 , had largely gone toward social welfare payments for easterners .
iwh president ulrich blum said only about 10 percent of the subsidies had gone to measures intended to spur economic growth while about 67 percent went towards social welfare benefits .
" the fact that the transfers increased rather than decreased in the last few years shocked us , " blum told the newspaper .
another study released this week showed that the eastern german economy has caught up with the west faster than expected .
the private cologne-based iw institute said that gross domestic product per capita , a key indicator of living standards , has risen in the east from 30 percent of that in the west in 1991 to 70 percent today .
the institute said that by 2020 , average gdp per capita in the east could reach 80 percent of that in the west and that the most prosperous eastern states could have overtaken the poorest of their western counterparts. rb / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

who should pay for environmental protection ?
that question is proving difficult to answer .
the upcoming climate conference in copenhagen could fail , warns germany 's development minister , dirk niebel . one month before the world climate conference in copenhagen , federal development minister dirk niebel is doubtful about the chances for agreement on new climate standards .
" the national government wants this to succeed , " niebel told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday .
" but there is real doubt about whether it is going to be possible at this time . "
niebel noted that even some sort of resolution outlining core goals for an international accord could be considered a success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel is worried that a new accord to replace the kyoto protocol may not be found climate protection gets expensive the climate summit in copenhagen is supposed to come up with a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
however , industrial and developing nations continue to argue over which countries must reduce their emissions and who should bear the costs of carbon dioxide reduction measures .
according to eu estimates , the earth 's poorest nations will need about 100 billion euros per year until 2020 .
about 22 to 50 billion euros of that will come from the public purse .
the eu has indicated that it is prepared to cover about a third of the costs .
but an agreement among all the industrialized countries is still pending .
" if there is n't an agreement on financing , if there is n't an agreement about contributions to make sure we can deal with this problem , then the copenhagen agreement is going to be much , much more difficult , " british finance minister alistair darling said on saturday , after finance ministers from the g20 countries met in st. andrews , scotland .
developing countries protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drought and rising temperatures are a growing problem in africa the eu is prepared to unilaterally reduce its emissions by 20 percent by 2020 - and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries join in .
according to an assessment by the copenhagen climate council , developed countries must reduce their emissions by 25 to 40 percent in order to hold an increase in global temperatures to two degrees .
for the developing countries , these promises are not enough .
during pre-copenhagen preparatory talks , held earlier this month in barcelona , 50 african countries temporarily walked out of the proceedings to protest what they saw as foot-dragging by the wealthier countries .
these nations , says the so-called " group of 77 " developing and threshhold countries , must reduce their emissions by at least 40 percent by 2020. svs / ap / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de industrialized countries should set climate protection example , says expert as a key climate conference in copenhagen nears , some nations are still showing little willingness to reach an agreement to protect the earth .
the usa , in particular , needs to change its tune , a german expert told dw .

who should pay for environmental protection ?
that question is proving difficult to answer .
the upcoming climate conference in copenhagen could fail , warns germany 's development minister , dirk niebel . one month before the world climate conference in copenhagen , federal development minister dirk niebel is doubtful about the chances for agreement on new climate standards .
" the national government wants this to succeed , " niebel told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday .
" but there is real doubt about whether it is going to be possible at this time . "
niebel noted that even some sort of resolution outlining core goals for an international accord could be considered a success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel is worried that a new accord to replace the kyoto protocol may not be found climate protection gets expensive the climate summit in copenhagen is supposed to come up with a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
however , industrial and developing nations continue to argue over which countries must reduce their emissions and who should bear the costs of carbon dioxide reduction measures .
according to eu estimates , the earth 's poorest nations will need about 100 billion euros per year until 2020 .
about 22 to 50 billion euros of that will come from the public purse .
the eu has indicated that it is prepared to cover about a third of the costs .
but an agreement among all the industrialized countries is still pending .
" if there is n't an agreement on financing , if there is n't an agreement about contributions to make sure we can deal with this problem , then the copenhagen agreement is going to be much , much more difficult , " british finance minister alistair darling said on saturday , after finance ministers from the g20 countries met in st. andrews , scotland .
developing countries protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drought and rising temperatures are a growing problem in africa the eu is prepared to unilaterally reduce its emissions by 20 percent by 2020 - and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries join in .
according to an assessment by the copenhagen climate council , developed countries must reduce their emissions by 25 to 40 percent in order to hold an increase in global temperatures to two degrees .
for the developing countries , these promises are not enough .
during pre-copenhagen preparatory talks , held earlier this month in barcelona , 50 african countries temporarily walked out of the proceedings to protest what they saw as foot-dragging by the wealthier countries .
these nations , says the so-called " group of 77 " developing and threshhold countries , must reduce their emissions by at least 40 percent by 2020. svs / ap / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of germany 's employer 's association , dieter hundt , has rejected further aid to opel , arguing that many small and mid-sized businesses in germany had been hit just as badly by the economic crisis .
hundt said if any aid is provided it should be done through the already existing " deutschlandfond " , which is open to all struggling businesses .
meanwhile , klaus franz , the head of opel 's works council which represents employees , urged general motors to appoint a german executive to manage its european operations .
gm has hinted that it is looking for a german after the resignation of its european ceo , carl-peter forster , who had been an outspoken supporter of the magna deal .

" in the last two decades , we have neglected to invest in roads and rail " in the west , ramsauer told the newspaper , referring to the reunification of east and west germany 20 years ago .
" now the time has come to make up for what we have failed to do , " he added .
he said there was a " considerable backlog " of important construction projects in western germany .
ramsauer said thanks to a 5.5 percent solidarity tax on german taxpayers and hundreds of billions of euros in state funding , roads and other infrastructure in the former east germany were no longer in disrepair but had instead been transformed into some of the finest in the world .
the transport minister added that this progress was sometimes achieved at the cost of infrastructure in western germany .
ramsauer ’ s comments have drawn negative reactions from some other members of the governing coalition , especially as they came amid celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the wall tumbling and national unification .
cornelia pieper , deputy chairman of the free democrats – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative bloc – criticized ramsauer ’ s comments as a " tasteless contribution . "
she was quoted as telling the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper that the minister had made the comments " in complete disregard for reality and has unnecessarily disturbed this day of joy . "

the halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- said the huge sum spent between 1991 and 2005 , had largely gone toward social welfare payments for easterners .
iwh president ulrich blum said only about 10 percent of the subsidies had gone to measures intended to spur economic growth while about 67 percent went towards social welfare benefits .
" the fact that the transfers increased rather than decreased in the last few years shocked us , " blum told the newspaper .
another study released this week showed that the eastern german economy has caught up with the west faster than expected .
the private cologne-based iw institute said that gross domestic product per capita , a key indicator of living standards , has risen in the east from 30 percent of that in the west in 1991 to 70 percent today .
the institute said that by 2020 , average gdp per capita in the east could reach 80 percent of that in the west and that the most prosperous eastern states could have overtaken the poorest of their western counterparts. rb / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the last two decades , we have neglected to invest in roads and rail " in the west , ramsauer told the newspaper , referring to the reunification of east and west germany 20 years ago .
" now the time has come to make up for what we have failed to do , " he added .
he said there was a " considerable backlog " of important construction projects in western germany .
ramsauer said thanks to a 5.5 percent solidarity tax on german taxpayers and hundreds of billions of euros in state funding , roads and other infrastructure in the former east germany were no longer in disrepair but had instead been transformed into some of the finest in the world .
the transport minister added that this progress was sometimes achieved at the cost of infrastructure in western germany .
ramsauer ’ s comments have drawn negative reactions from some other members of the governing coalition , especially as they came amid celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the wall tumbling and national unification .
cornelia pieper , deputy chairman of the free democrats – junior partners to chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative bloc – criticized ramsauer ’ s comments as a " tasteless contribution . "
she was quoted as telling the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper that the minister had made the comments " in complete disregard for reality and has unnecessarily disturbed this day of joy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minister has called for stepping up investment in infrastructure in the west ‘ 1.3 trillion euros transferred to former east germany ’ a new study out on sunday showed that reunited germany transferred some 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 trillion -rrb- to prop up the former communist east in the years following the berlin wall 's fall .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- said the huge sum spent between 1991 and 2005 , had largely gone toward social welfare payments for easterners .
iwh president ulrich blum said only about 10 percent of the subsidies had gone to measures intended to spur economic growth while about 67 percent went towards social welfare benefits .
" the fact that the transfers increased rather than decreased in the last few years shocked us , " blum told the newspaper .
another study released this week showed that the eastern german economy has caught up with the west faster than expected .
the private cologne-based iw institute said that gross domestic product per capita , a key indicator of living standards , has risen in the east from 30 percent of that in the west in 1991 to 70 percent today .
the institute said that by 2020 , average gdp per capita in the east could reach 80 percent of that in the west and that the most prosperous eastern states could have overtaken the poorest of their western counterparts. rb / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

of those questioned , 28 percent said they approved of additional funding .
the german government has signaled it would be prepared to provide financial aid to opel , if gm paid back the portions of the transition loan it has already used .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister puts caveats on aid for opel german economics minister rainer bruederle , however , has warned gm that it had no automatic entitlement to the three billion euros in state aid promised for the original deal with canadian auto parts supplier magna .
the head of germany 's employer 's association , dieter hundt , has rejected further aid to opel , arguing that many small and mid-sized businesses in germany had been hit just as badly by the economic crisis .
hundt said if any aid is provided it should be done through the already existing " deutschlandfond " , which is open to all struggling businesses .
meanwhile , klaus franz , the head of opel 's works council which represents employees , urged general motors to appoint a german executive to manage its european operations .

to find out what 's really important check out our top 3 cultural picks . top 1 : pina bausch , german theater prize ther faust pina bausch earned hard-won recognition for what ’ s known as tanztheater .
five months after her unexpected death , the queen of dance has been honored with germany ’ s most prestigious theatre award , the faust .
and it ’ s our number one of the week .
movements that revolutionized dance thirty years ago - like her early , individualistic interpretation of stravinsky ’ s rite of spring .
bausch turned wuppertal into an international centre of dance .
she won many awards and was known internationally as one of germany ’ s most important female artists .
the jury chose pina bausch for the prize before her death – and her ideas live on .
a fitting tribute to her lifetime achievement . top 2 : james turrell , kunstmuseum wolfsburg space and time seem to dissolve .
light becomes tangible .
american artist james turrell is showing his biggest light installation to date in wolfsburg ’ s kunstmuseum .
turrell plays with our perceptions .
his colors draw the viewer into the distance – unreal rooms open up .
the arizona desert gave turrell the ideal place to experiment with colors and light .
he built the world ’ s largest artwork made of light at the roden crater , part of an extinct volcano .
now a part of infinity is in wolfsburg .

in this modernized version of the famous viennese operetta , one performer shines above all the rest : soprano christine schäfer as adele , the maid .
a ballet corps as cocaine-addled clubbers is bizarre .

it was the beginning of the end for east germany . guenter schabowski 's press conference on november 9 , 1989 was a fairly dull affair for most of its duration , according to those present .
but a question by an italian journalist right at the end turned it into one of european history 's most memorable events .
schabowski was asked just before 7 p.m. about when a new law permitting gdr citizens more freedom of travel would go into effect .
schabowski famously told the journalist : " as far as i know , that goes into effect now , immediately . "
since television viewers in both east and west germany were following the live press conference , his comments electrified east germans and eventually led to a redrawing of the european map .
immediately following the remark , gdr citizens rushed to the border separating east and west berlin , wanting to visit the western part of the city .
the gdr border guards were unaware of the press conference , and , taken aback by the crowds gathering in front of them , made repeated calls to their superiors asking for guidance .
they successfully prevented citizens from crossing the border for three hours .
but later in the evening , the guards relented and opened the borders .
people were able to cross freely from east to west for the first time since the wall was erected on august 21 , 1961 .
" we are the people ! "
in the months prior to schabowski 's press conference , thousands of gdr citizens had taken to the streets demanding political reform .
the so-called " monday demonstrators " in the eastern city of leipzig had drawn special attention for their protests .
shouts by demonstrators of " we are the people ! " became commonplace , followed by " gorbi !
gorbi ! " – calls directed at mikhail gorbachev , the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union .
since 1985 , gorbachev had been implementing reforms in his country , and germans living in the gdr hoped to see his ideas adopted there as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70,000 protestors took to the streets on october 9 , 1989 in leipzig however , the hardline government under gdr leader erich honecker was not interested in reform , and the government 's refusal to change ultimately led to its own demise .
on october 18 , 1989 , honecker was forced to step down .
he was replaced by egon krenz as head of state , but even this shift could not prevent the gdr 's collapse .
a november 4 protest at berlin 's alexanderplatz attracted 500,000 people , making it clear that a change of leadership would not win the people 's trust .
when the berlin wall opened five days later , demands for reunification of east and west germany grew louder .
german unity and european integration in light of the increasing support for reunification , western diplomats travelled to the gdr a few weeks after the wall 's opening .
france and england in particular reacted with mistrust to the prospect of the large and economically powerful german state that reunification would create in the heart of europe .
if they could not stop reunification entirely , the two countries at least hoped to apply political sanctions on germany .
helmut kohl , then-chancellor of germany , kept their position in mind as he delivered a speech in front of the ruins of dresden 's " frauenkirche " cathedral that drew worldwide attention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- and francois mitterrand negotiated on the future of the gdr kohl declared that german unity would only be possible in the context of a more unified europe generally .
he said german and european unification were just two sides of the same coin .
his speech garnered thunderous applause from the gdr citizens in attendance .
nevertheless , french president francois mitterrand travelled to the gdr two days later in an attempt to prevent west germany from annexing the east .
by early 1990 , the international community watched closely the process of german reunification to ensure that the interests of germans as well as of the four conquering allied powers from world war ii -lrb- england , france , the us and the soviet union -rrb- were respected .
german negotiators worked out the conditions of a german reunification internally , while both west and east german officials consulted with the four powers about the international ramifications of their proposal .
this so-called " 2 plus 4 " process -lrb- representing the two german states and the four allied powers -rrb- concluded with a declaration of sovereignty for germany on september 12 , 1990 .
german negotiations had already resulted in a contract that specified all aspects of the new relationship between east and west germany on august 31 , 1990 .
on october 3 , 1990 , the former east german states officially joined the federal republic of germany .
the date marked the end of the gdr and the beginning of a reunified federal republic .

the allied military presence in respective sectors gave west berlin the feel of an occupied zone well into the 1980 's .
" western soldiers were customers in shops , in hairdressers .
they were part of everyday life , " reminds nolte . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification was not only a domestic problem " it was not just a german problem - something that was split up that had to be reunified - but the whole history of world war ii hung over it .
the international legal situation still had to be cleared up , as the two-plus-four negotiations of 1990 showed , " nolte says .
the two-plus-four agreement , signed in moscow in september 1990 between the two germanys and the four occupying powers , sealed the final international acceptance of reunification . before then , a veritable tug-of-war developed between thatcher and her representatives .
diplomats like ambassador mallaby were eager to put britain in a more favorable position once something that now seemed inevitable was accomplished . the new files show thatcher 's foreign secretary douglas hurd giving her some blunt advice in a meeting january 1990 .
" if the people of the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic decide freely and democratically in favor of unity , there is no way of stopping that , short of military action , " he told her . the timing of the release of such documents - a full decade before british law required it - shows that the british foreign office apparently felt that its diplomatic reputation needed a little rehabilitation . this is somewhat surprising to roedder .
" the british and the french apparently have a significant need to explain themselves .
i do n't really understand it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i can see that the british and french governments , in a new unified europe , see their own attitudes in a bad light .
it 's also curious that the french are celebrating the 20th anniversary on the champs-élysées .
but the fact that a lot of british and french people were n't exactly overjoyed at the thought of a reunified germany , is completely understandable .
it changed the power balance in europe . " twin fears thatcher had two main fears that were feeding each other in the fraught year between the fall of the berlin wall and reunification - a united germany would be able to strengthen the european community , and a stronger ec would in turn increase germany 's power .
thatcher 's position was in fact not far from the more hysterical right-wing body of opinion in britain , expressed by backbench mps , that germany planned to use the european community to dominate the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how could anyone have been against it ? " while she aired her suspicions publicly , mitterand kept his misgivings private .
the french president was committed to the european project , and in exchange for his blessing for a unified germany , was able to extract from kohl his commitment to european economic and monetary union .
this was exactly what thatcher feared .
" the problems will not be overcome by strengthening the ec .
germany ’ s ambitions would then become the dominant and active factor , " thatcher was quoted as saying in february 1990 . the result was that britain 's diplomacy became crippled in europe and elsewhere .
the german press seized on britain 's perceived negativity and magnified it , until it damaged britain 's relationship with the us , a nation that remained enthusiastic about reunification throughout . the fears of foreign office official sir john fretwell , expressed with some foresight late in 1989 , came true : " if we tried to stand against this tide , we should enter into fundamental political conflict with the federal republic of germany and with many of our allies , including the united states . "
if britain did not begin to convey the impression that it shared the vision of a united europe , he said later , the germans " will be tempted increasingly to move ahead without us on these fundamental issues of european policy . " when thatcher was finally brought down by her own party , in part because of her recalcitrance on european policy , the significance was not lost on those germans .

the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out . " on the other hand , nolte was surprised by the skepticism that french president francois mitterrand apparently had toward german reunification .
" that 's the biggest revelation from my point of view , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : even francois mitterand , left , harbored misgivings about having a new , unified neighbor wary france the speed with which germany under kohl moved toward reunification seems to have taken europe 's leaders by surprise .
in october 1989 an analysis of the " german question " by the french foreign ministry judged that reunification " does not appear realistic at this moment . " in a letter dated nov .
24 , 1989 from mitterrand to east german leader egon krenz , the french president talked of " perspectives of development in relations with the german democratic republic and the european community . "
four days later kohl introduced his 10-point unification plan to the world . by presenting this program , the normally wary kohl shrewdly seized the initiative both at home , where the opposition social democrats were threatening to steal the issue from him , and abroad .
among the 244 newly released foreign office documents , british ambassador in bonn sir christopher mallaby summed up its significance on the same day . " the key point is that the pressures have reached a level where kohl has felt obliged to make a high profile statement of a policy expressly intended to lead in time to german unity , " he wrote to the british government , " and he has done so on his own authority , not on behalf of the whole coalition , and without prior consultation with the allies … it shows how fast the german question is moving .

at 3:00 p.m. local time , german chancellor angela merkel , together with former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and ex-polish president lech walesa , took a symbolic stroll across a bridge at bornholmer strasse - a former checkpoint along the berlin wall .
it was the first border crossing to be opened in the city , and merkel , who grew up in east germany , was among those east berliners who surged into the west on the evening of november 9 , 1989 .
in a speech , she honored all those who became victims of the east german regime , and also offered thanks to those who supported east germans in their struggle to live in a free society .
she also praised gorbachev for his role in reforming the soviet union .
" you made this possible , you courageously let things happen , and that was much more than we could expect , " she told gorbachev .
her words came ahead of the main ceremonies which will be held at the brandenburg gate .
there , the chancellor will be joined by russian president dmitri medvedev , us secretary of state hillary clinton and the leaders of all 27 european union member states , including french president nicolas sarkozy and british prime minister gordon brown .

they have been decorated by various artists as well as berlin school children to reflect upon what reunification represents to the people of east and west germany .
many of the dominos carry messages like " we are one people . "
one labeled " bleeding heart " shows a sword cutting through the city of berlin , starting a crimson flow of blood speckled with crosses .
bildunterschrift : artists , students and school children decorated the dominos symbolizing the fall of the wall " everyone has walls in their heads to a certain extent , " said one berlin resident stefan schueler , who was admiring the artwork .
" it is always a good thing if one can break them down , and i think this is a good symbol . "
" it 's really very beautiful , it 's a terrific idea , " said barbara graff , a 74-year-old city resident .
recalling november 9 , 1989 , she said that she went to west berlin 's main shopping street , kurfuerstendamm , and " distributed money to the people arriving en masse from the east . "
human chain to form in addition to the toppling of the dominos , the celebrations include a fireworks display , concerts and a human chain linking thousands of germans and foreigners together along the former path of the wall .
the president of the berlin assembly , walter momper , on saturday donated the first of many stone pillars to be erected in the city 's berlin wall park to remember those killed while trying to escape communist east germany .
over the next few years , more pillars will be added until all the 136 victims shot and killed between 1961 and 1989 have been commemorated .
berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , said his city had become a symbol for " the dream of liberty . "

one of them is franziska wahl .
and she has this poscard on how she found life in west germany as an " ossie " . i was nine when the wall came down .
i was living with my family , close to the inner german border .
we were n't among those who left immediately for the west .
due to many intimidating personal experiences in the nearby restricted zone , my parents were cautious , and sceptical that the east german government would actually keep the border open and let us back in .
we followed events on television for several weeks before finally joining the queues on the motorway and driving to the nearest town in bavaria .
it was a strange feeling to cross through the old border controls and actually see the fully stocked supermarkets on the other side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franziska wahl - the token " ossi " living in the west it was n't until another 10 years later that i swapped jena as my place of study for essen and moved to the west .
by then , the typical " east-west " mentality did n't exist any more for me personally .
of course , i was aware of many differences but resisted such a black-and-white way of thinking .
even at that point in time , most of my university friends had never set foot in the former east .
at university i remained the token " ossi " in contrast to the university in jena , where students came from all over germany , the majority of students in essen were from the area and lived at home - as was the case in many cities in the ruhr valley .
that meant that in my seminar group , i remained the token " ossi " .
there were many evenings where i had to regale my friends with tales of my childhood in the gdr and my experiences in the east german state-run youth organisations – the communist pioneers .
they found my stories about the 10 commandments for pioneers or secretly watching the forbidden west television shows , amusing and fascinating in part , but also unimaginable .
there were also several students from abroad living in my university halls of residence .
among them , a very interesting english boy , for whom i was always " the girl from east germany " – i 'm still not sure he remembered my proper name !
now , 10 years further down the line , i still live in dortmund , deep in western germany .
and even today , there are many occasions where i find myself talking to friends from the east and the west about everyday things that are " typical east german " or " typical west german " – and it is mostly with a raised smile .
but for me , there will always be something more important than amusing differences in behaviour : that people should never forget what the gdr was really like and that – apart from some things that really were n't that bad – the fact remains that it was an unjust regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 08.11.2009 germany 's neighbors try to redeem their 1989 negativity 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher was openly hostile to the reunification of germany the recent reopening of archives from 1989 has revealed embarrassing bigotry in some former european leaders .
the release of the secret files to coincide with anniversary celebrations is meant as a kind of redemption . germans have often noted british tourists ' world war ii obsession with a mixture of bemusement and dismay .
but recent revelations have shown that this preoccupation , usually expressed in the un-threatening confines of comedy , was also the british prime minister 's deep personal phobia at the time of germany 's reunification . while usa and , surprisingly , the soviet union , largely welcomed the moment of redemption and euphoria that ushered in the end of a black century , germany 's non-superpower neighbors were prey to old fears . " it is still an uncomfortable thought , " professor paul nolte , who teaches history at the free university in berlin , told deutsche welle , " that something that germans were so happy about , and that unified europe , could have been rejected by our closest partners .
we ask ourselves , ' how could anyone have been against it ? ' " at the end of october this year , france followed britain in releasing its foreign policy archives from 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to the reunification of germany .
although the files will not precipitate a major reassessment of history , they illustrate the depth of fear among western leaders who were publicly celebrating the victory of democratic freedom over communism . ' capable of anything ' in a telegram found in the french archives and dated march 13 , 1990 , prime minister margaret thatcher is quoted by the french ambassador in london describing chancellor helmut kohl as being " capable of anything .
he has become a different man .
he does not know who he is anymore .
he sees himself as the master and is starting to act like it . " the lack of empathy between kohl and thatcher is well-documented - for his part , kohl once remarked that he feared the british leader as " the devil fears holy water " - nor is there much of a secret around thatcher 's hostility to reunification , which her memoirs had already made clear . in a more sober moment , thatcher told mikhail gorbachev , " britain and western europe are not interested in the unification of germany .
the words written in the nato communiqué may sound different , but disregard them .
we do not want the unification of germany . " the files newly released by the british foreign office do little more than confirm the german image of thatcher .
" this does n't change the total picture much , " says andreas roedder , a professor at the university of mainz who published a book on reunification this year , " but the details fill it out . " on the other hand , nolte was surprised by the skepticism that french president francois mitterrand apparently had toward german reunification .
" that 's the biggest revelation from my point of view , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : even francois mitterand , left , harbored misgivings about having a new , unified neighbor wary france the speed with which germany under kohl moved toward reunification seems to have taken europe 's leaders by surprise .
in october 1989 an analysis of the " german question " by the french foreign ministry judged that reunification " does not appear realistic at this moment . " in a letter dated nov .
24 , 1989 from mitterrand to east german leader egon krenz , the french president talked of " perspectives of development in relations with the german democratic republic and the european community . "
four days later kohl introduced his 10-point unification plan to the world . by presenting this program , the normally wary kohl shrewdly seized the initiative both at home , where the opposition social democrats were threatening to steal the issue from him , and abroad .
among the 244 newly released foreign office documents , british ambassador in bonn sir christopher mallaby summed up its significance on the same day . " the key point is that the pressures have reached a level where kohl has felt obliged to make a high profile statement of a policy expressly intended to lead in time to german unity , " he wrote to the british government , " and he has done so on his own authority , not on behalf of the whole coalition , and without prior consultation with the allies … it shows how fast the german question is moving . "
in response , thatcher remarked , " christopher mallaby seems to welcome reunification . " read more about the allies ' concerns 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

who should pay for environmental protection ?
that question is proving difficult to answer .
the upcoming climate conference in copenhagen could fail , warns germany 's development minister , dirk niebel . one month before the world climate conference in copenhagen , federal development minister dirk niebel is doubtful about the chances for agreement on new climate standards .
" the national government wants this to succeed , " niebel told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper on saturday .
" but there is real doubt about whether it is going to be possible at this time . "
niebel noted that even some sort of resolution outlining core goals for an international accord could be considered a success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel is worried that a new accord to replace the kyoto protocol may not be found climate protection gets expensive the climate summit in copenhagen is supposed to come up with a successor to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
however , industrial and developing nations continue to argue over which countries must reduce their emissions and who should bear the costs of carbon dioxide reduction measures .
according to eu estimates , the earth 's poorest nations will need about 100 billion euros per year until 2020 .
about 22 to 50 billion euros of that will come from the public purse .
the eu has indicated that it is prepared to cover about a third of the costs .
but an agreement among all the industrialized countries is still pending .
" if there is n't an agreement on financing , if there is n't an agreement about contributions to make sure we can deal with this problem , then the copenhagen agreement is going to be much , much more difficult , " british finance minister alistair darling said on saturday , after finance ministers from the g20 countries met in st. andrews , scotland .
developing countries protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drought and rising temperatures are a growing problem in africa the eu is prepared to unilaterally reduce its emissions by 20 percent by 2020 - and by 30 percent if other industrialized countries join in .
according to an assessment by the copenhagen climate council , developed countries must reduce their emissions by 25 to 40 percent in order to hold an increase in global temperatures to two degrees .
for the developing countries , these promises are not enough .
during pre-copenhagen preparatory talks , held earlier this month in barcelona , 50 african countries temporarily walked out of the proceedings to protest what they saw as foot-dragging by the wealthier countries .
these nations , says the so-called " group of 77 " developing and threshhold countries , must reduce their emissions by at least 40 percent by 2020. svs / ap / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

editor john mullin said that the paper had decided that " enough is enough " in the wake of what he called afghanistan 's " failed election " .
' conflicting aims ' the paper , whose circulation in september was reported as 125,232 , devotes its first seven pages to the conflict .
in its leader , it says withdrawal would be " a british decision in the british interest " . "
we must start to plan now for a phased withdrawal " john mullin editor , independent on sunday mr mullin added : " we 've been there eight years , we 've made very , very limited progress .
" we 've gone through a series of very conflicting aims of what the war is about from right at the outset .
" we 're not saying we come out tomorrow - but what we are saying is we must start to plan now for a phased withdrawal , and for talks and attempts at a political solution to this situation . "
the paper 's decision comes as a survey for the bbc 's politics show found 64 % of britons believe the war is " unwinnable " , up from 58 % in july .
the senior uk commander in afghanistan , lt gen jim dutton , admitted in an interview for the programme that " collectively we have not been as good at explaining " the mission .
so far , 95 uk service personnel have been killed in 2009 - the highest toll in a single year since the falklands campaign 27 years ago .

he has pledged to get a reform bill passed this year .
lawmakers in congress have been finding it difficult to agree on a bill to implement reform , but the president 's supporters received a major boost when the house of representatives passed its bill on 7 november .
how is the us healthcare system currently structured ?
unlike other developed countries , the us does not have a universal system of healthcare coverage .
it is up to individuals to obtain health insurance .
most americans obtain coverage through their employers , but others sign up for private insurance schemes .
under the terms of most coverage plans , members pay regular premiums , but they are sometimes also required to pay part of the cost of their treatment -lrb- known in the us as a deductible -rrb- before the insurer covers the expense .
the amount they pay varies according to their plan .
does the us government provide health coverage for anyone ?
yes .
americans aged 65 or over can sign up for the government-run medicare scheme , and low-income parents , children , pregnant women and people with certain disabilities are eligible for the government-administered medicaid programme .
the us government also runs the state children 's health insurance program -lrb- s-chip -rrb- , which provides coverage to children whose parents are on modest incomes , but not poor enough to qualify for medicaid .
military veterans are also provided healthcare by a government-run scheme .
so what are the problems with the us system ?
healthcare costs for individuals are rising dramatically .
premiums for employer-provided schemes have risen four times faster than wages , and are now double their cost nine years ago .
the percentage of employees with an annual deductible greater than $ 1,000 increased from 1 % to 18 % between 2000 and 2008 .
as a nation , the us spent some $ 2.2tn -lrb- £ 1.34tn -rrb- on healthcare in 2007 .
that amounts to 16.2 % of gdp , nearly twice the average of other oecd countries .
what are the effects of rising health costs ?
the rising individual costs mean that more and more people in america are unable to afford health insurance .
tens of millions of americans do not have insurance , and millions more are deemed " under-insured " - their coverage is inadequate for their needs .
when someone without insurance -lrb- or with inadequate cover -rrb- falls ill , they are obliged to pay their medical costs out of their own pocket .
mr obama says he wants to pass healthcare reform by the end of 2009 half of all personal bankruptcies in the us are at least partially the result of medical expenses .
rising costs also mean the government is spending more and more on medicare and medicaid .
us government spending on the two schemes is projected to rise from 4 % of gdp in 2007 to 7 % in 2025 and 12 % in 2050 , making rising healthcare costs one of the biggest contributing factors to the spiralling us budget deficit .
how many people in america do not have health insurance ?
the us census bureau estimates that 46.3 million people in america , out of a population of 300 million , were uninsured in 2008 .
supporters of healthcare reform often use this figure as evidence that the system is failing too many americans and needs to change .
some opponents , however , say the figure is misleading as it includes illegal immigrants , americans who earn over $ 50,000 a year and americans who are eligible for medicaid or s-chip who could get coverage if they wanted to .
it also includes people who may have been temporarily in between jobs , and therefore only briefly without coverage .
the census bureau confirms that the 46.3 million figure includes 9.2 million non-citizens , and 18 million people who earn over $ 50,000 a year .
but backers of reform insist that - aside from illegal immigrants , who would not be covered under any of the plans for reform proposed by congress or the white house - many of the 46.3 million uninsured people would indeed benefit from an overhaul , and that it is therefore a meaningful figure to cite .
what is president obama proposing ?
after initially choosing to leave the specifics of reform to congress , on 9 september president obama laid out more detailed proposals in an address to both chambers of congress .
mr obama wants to provide more security and stability to americans who have health insurance , provide insurance to those who do not and slow the growth of healthcare costs .
he supports tougher regulations for the insurance industry , ensuring that people with pre-existing conditions can not be refused cover , and preventing insurers from dropping people 's coverage when they get ill .
for those whose employers do not provide coverage , mr obama wants to create health insurance exchanges - one-stop shops for people to compare different options .
the president supports a proposal to set up a government-run scheme that would be offered to people who are eligible for the exchanges , but he has indicated that he would still support a bill that did not include this so-called " public option " .
under mr obama 's plan , every american would be required to get insurance , or face a fine -lrb- this is called an " individual mandate " -rrb- .
less well-off americans would be offered subsidies to help them pay for their coverage .
the president would pay for his $ 900bn plan by cutting waste from the existing medicare programme , and levying fees on insurance companies who offer " gold-plated " insurance plans .
what about congress ?
a number of congressional committees have been working on healthcare reform bills .
the broad outlines of all of the competing bills are pretty similar , and are compatible with mr obama 's vision for healthcare reform .
all the bills : favour tougher regulations for insurers establish an individual mandate set up insurance exchanges for those who do not have employer-provided coverage offer subsidies for the less well-off -lrb- although the exact size of the subsidies varies from committee to committee -rrb- pay for most of the reforms by cutting waste in the medicare programme .
the major points of disagreement are on the " public option " and on how to pay for the remainder of reform .
the senate health committee was the first to pass a healthcare reform bill the house of representatives bill backed a " public option " and proposed to pay for reform by levying a surtax of up to 5.4 % on families earning over $ 350,000 a year , but the public option was scaled back before the vote .
in the senate , the health committee also backs the idea of a public option , but does not have the power to rule on financial matters .
these issues come under the jurisdiction of the senate finance committee .
the finance committee 's chairman , max baucus , gathered together an informal , bipartisan group of senators - known as the " gang of six " - in an attempt to hammer out a compromise that would attract support from both parties , but the " gang " failed to come to an agreement .
the bill eventually drawn up by the full committee does not contain a government-run scheme , after liberal democrats failed in their attempts to pass amendments to include a public option .
the committee voted to pass it in october 2009 , with one republican joining democrats in favour .
the bill will now be combined with the health committee 's bill by a team of senior democrats , and go before the full senate for a vote .
what happens if the house and senate pass bills that are at odds with one another ?
a conference committee will be established , made up of members from both chambers , to reconcile the two versions of the bill .
if , unlike the house , the senate passes a bill that does not include a public option , the conference committee will decide whether or not to include a public option in its reconciled bill .
then , both chambers will vote on the final version of the bill .
if both vote in favour , the bill will go to the president for his approval .
will healthcare reform pass this year ?
with so much of his political capital now resting on passage of a bill , mr obama and his team will be lobbying hard to get a bill passed this year , and may be prepared to make some compromises along the way .
notably , conservative democrats may have been persuaded to vote for the house bill after being offered an amendment imposing new restrictions on abortion coverage in insurance policies for individuals and groups .
whether or not the final bill pleases healthcare reform advocates , therefore , remains to be seen .
