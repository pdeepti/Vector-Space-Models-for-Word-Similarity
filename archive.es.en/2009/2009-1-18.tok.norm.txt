program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 18.01.2009 muslims in germany seek clarity on religious law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imams consult the koran and draw on the life of muhammad to issue fatwas imams have a strong influence on muslims living in germany .
one of their tasks is the issuing of fatwas - religious opinions on islamic law which can serve as behavioral guidelines for muslims in specific situations . for years now , the teachings of imams in germany have been hotly debated . the vast majority -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- are of turkish origin , but there are also imams from morocco and iran .
frequently , imams speak little or no german , nor are they acquainted with the political , social and cultural norms in germany .
many politicians - as well as many muslims living in germany - are now demanding that this situation change . ferid heider grew up in berlin and serves as imam at two of the city 's mosques .
" every muslim can decide for himself who he recognizes as an authority figure , " heider said . as a muslim and an imam , heider is under no obligation to follow the fatwas issued , for example , at the al-azhar university in cairo - one of the most significant educational institutes in the islamic world - or any other scholarly community for that matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is home to a large muslim population his task , he said , is to do the best he can according to knowledge and his conscience .
for him , that means taking the german way of life into account when offering opinions and advice .
a fatwa , he stressed , should always refer to a specific case and set of circumstances . challenges of life in germany heider said he 's often asked by those in his religious community about which behaviors should be permitted or forbidden for muslims .
everyday life in germany is not without conflict for muslims .
prayer times and working hours often do n't mesh , nudity - whether in parks , gyms or the media - is pervasive , and alcohol is freely available . the imam listens to people 's problems , and then refers to the koran and examples from the life of the prophet muhammad .
based on these sources , he then issues an islamic legal opinion . for fatwas issued in europe , heider said it 's important to have " islamic scholars in europe that have either grown up here or have lived here for a long time . "
in his view , only those who are intimately acquainted with the political , social and economic situation of a place can issue adequate fatwas . fatwas issued in germany often vary greatly from those issued in countries with a majority muslim population .
that 's in part due to the nature of a fatwa , says bettina graef , an islamic scholar at berlin 's center for modern oriental studies -lrb- zmo -rrb- .
a fatwa may be a ruling in an individual case , but its significance is often much larger . " everything that 's not forbidden is , in principle , allowed , " said graef .
" and so of course people try to push the boundaries . " fatwas are of central importance to the islamic identity , says graef - an identity that has become particularly important in europe and the us since the 1990s . fatwas imposed from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some aspects of life in germany present dilemmas for muslims many legal scholars in traditional islamic countries view the new islamic practice of law in europe with concern .
they 're worried that their brothers in faith are straying too far from the right path , and may be jeopardizing islam .
in order to prevent this , they issue their own fatwas about how muslims in europe should lead their lives . these fatwas may be issued in far-off countries , but they 're nonetheless a source of concern for law professor and expert on islamic law mathias rohe .
it 's a worrying development , he said , adding that it has its roots in saudi arabia .
imams there have issued opinions demanding that muslims in europe hold themselves apart from what is , in their view , a faithless world . islam is a religion without a highest authority .
there 's no position that is comparable to the catholic pope .
instead , the faithful can choose from a multitude of voices : the imam from the nearest mosque , scholars at al-azhar university , prominent tv sheiks , and superregional fatwa committees .
islamic extremists can just as easily find fatwas to confirm their beliefs as can moderate muslims who believe in peaceful coexistence with members of other religions . islamic organizations representing muslims in germany have also attempted to convince their followers to subscribe to a set of basic principles .
the variety of opinions and degree of individualism hampers muslims ' efforts to successfully represent themselves as a group , said burhan kesici , the secretary general of the islamic council in germany . in his view , having some commonality on fatwas is beneficial to the credibility of islamic spokespeople in germany and europe .
a common islamic organization could very well influence the beliefs of individuals , kesici said .
in addition , it would make it possible to exclude muslims with extremist views . heiner kiesel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 18.01.2009 germany 's young athletes learn to say no to doping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traces from a joint from passive smoking can be detected in laboratory samples a new generation of top teenage german athletes are getting professional guidance from the national anti-doping agency .
the program uses various methods to promote the principle " i am clean . " doping in professional sports has become so ubiquitous that substance abuse is lurking in the background of each new world record that gets broken .
the aim of the national anti-doping agency 's -lrb- nada -rrb- prevention program is to eradicate any thought of consuming illegal substances under the motto " solidarity against doping - i am clean . "
nada regularly visits all 39 elite german sports schools , stretching from the north-eastern seaport of rostock to berchtesgaden in the bavarian alps bordering on austria , to get across its message of fair play and inform athletes of the hazards of drug abuse .
awareness of doping pitfalls ulrike spitz , deputy director of nada , said it is vital to discuss the pitfalls of doping with young people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cycling has been one professional sport riddled with doping scandals " a new generation of athletes need to grow up fully aware of the consequences of doping .
it 's not just a matter of being eliminated from competition if discovered .
aside from the health risks , funding can be cut , for example , and the athletes wo n't be nominated for the olympics , " she said .
" we have to make it clear to them that the right path is the clean one , " added spitz . which begs the question : what exactly is " clean " ?
which substances are illegal or forbidden ?
graphic images of health risks some young people have already experimented with illegal drugs .
but that traces of a joint from passive smoking or digesting a piece of poppy seed cake can be detected in a doping test is news to many .
however , it 's the stark photos of health damage that makes them stop in their tracks .
" it not enough to tell them that erythropoietin will thicken one 's blood to the point of bringing them to the brink of death .
that 's too abstract .
but graphic images of prickled skin or enlarged male breasts have shock value , " said spitz .
top athletes as role models when that 's not enough , professional athletes step in to act as role models for teenagers and go on tour with nada officials .
world handball champion stefan schroeder , 27 , once had a doping problem and recounts his struggles to younger athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nada promotes its anti-doping message in all 39 top sports schools in germany " it 's vital that young people are well-informed so that they do n't fall into the doping trap in the first place , " he said .
" then they can be calm when they take the first urine test .
they should n't be surprised when someone looks over their shoulder while they 're going to the bathroom , " he added .
wary of prescription medicine the teenagers also have experiences of their own to relate .
natalia cukseeva , an 18-year-old professional volleyball player from hamburg said she pays attention when a physician prescribes medicine for her .
" when i had a sports injury , i wound up getting just about every kind of painkiller .
since i was n't sure , i did n't take anything that was n't on the approved drug list , " she said .
nada gets top marks with the youngsters .
levke springer , an 18-year-old beach volleyball player , said she was glad she took part in the program with her fellow boarding schoolmates .
" i found it interesting to get an inside look at how top professional athletes deal with doping issues and checks , " said springer .
" it 's important that fairness in sports is encouraged , " she said . uli petersen -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , to end the gas crisis , which has blocked shipments of russian gas to ukraine and much of western europe since the beginning of the year . in a statement issued sunday , the european commission welcomed the agreement , but said it remained to be seen whether gas would actually arrive in europe in the coming days . experts have said it could take up to three days for gas supplies to reach europe and for pressure to return to normal in pipelines after the taps are opened .
for some countries which have nearly run out of reserve supplies , this could continue to create short-term problems . under the agreement , ukraine would be offered a 20-percent discount on the market price for russian gas deliveries this year , if it agrees to keep transits fees for pumping gas to europe via its pipelines at the 2008 level .

the program uses various methods to promote the principle " i am clean . " doping in professional sports has become so ubiquitous that substance abuse is lurking in the background of each new world record that gets broken .
the aim of the national anti-doping agency 's -lrb- nada -rrb- prevention program is to eradicate any thought of consuming illegal substances under the motto " solidarity against doping - i am clean . "
nada regularly visits all 39 elite german sports schools , stretching from the north-eastern seaport of rostock to berchtesgaden in the bavarian alps bordering on austria , to get across its message of fair play and inform athletes of the hazards of drug abuse .
awareness of doping pitfalls ulrike spitz , deputy director of nada , said it is vital to discuss the pitfalls of doping with young people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cycling has been one professional sport riddled with doping scandals " a new generation of athletes need to grow up fully aware of the consequences of doping .
it 's not just a matter of being eliminated from competition if discovered .
aside from the health risks , funding can be cut , for example , and the athletes wo n't be nominated for the olympics , " she said .
" we have to make it clear to them that the right path is the clean one , " added spitz . which begs the question : what exactly is " clean " ?
which substances are illegal or forbidden ?
graphic images of health risks some young people have already experimented with illegal drugs .
but that traces of a joint from passive smoking or digesting a piece of poppy seed cake can be detected in a doping test is news to many .
however , it 's the stark photos of health damage that makes them stop in their tracks .
" it not enough to tell them that erythropoietin will thicken one 's blood to the point of bringing them to the brink of death .
that 's too abstract .
but graphic images of prickled skin or enlarged male breasts have shock value , " said spitz .
top athletes as role models when that 's not enough , professional athletes step in to act as role models for teenagers and go on tour with nada officials .
world handball champion stefan schroeder , 27 , once had a doping problem and recounts his struggles to younger athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nada promotes its anti-doping message in all 39 top sports schools in germany " it 's vital that young people are well-informed so that they do n't fall into the doping trap in the first place , " he said .
" then they can be calm when they take the first urine test .
they should n't be surprised when someone looks over their shoulder while they 're going to the bathroom , " he added .
wary of prescription medicine the teenagers also have experiences of their own to relate .
natalia cukseeva , an 18-year-old professional volleyball player from hamburg said she pays attention when a physician prescribes medicine for her .
" when i had a sports injury , i wound up getting just about every kind of painkiller .
since i was n't sure , i did n't take anything that was n't on the approved drug list , " she said .
nada gets top marks with the youngsters .
levke springer , an 18-year-old beach volleyball player , said she was glad she took part in the program with her fellow boarding schoolmates .
" i found it interesting to get an inside look at how top professional athletes deal with doping issues and checks , " said springer .

19 , to end the gas crisis , which has blocked shipments of russian gas to ukraine and much of western europe since the beginning of the year . in a statement issued sunday , the european commission welcomed the agreement , but said it remained to be seen whether gas would actually arrive in europe in the coming days . experts have said it could take up to three days for gas supplies to reach europe and for pressure to return to normal in pipelines after the taps are opened .
for some countries which have nearly run out of reserve supplies , this could continue to create short-term problems . under the agreement , ukraine would be offered a 20-percent discount on the market price for russian gas deliveries this year , if it agrees to keep transits fees for pumping gas to europe via its pipelines at the 2008 level .
for ukraine , this still means a substantial increase in the first quarter . putin said both countries would switch to european market prices in their gas trade starting in 2010 . eu was getting anxious europe receives a quarter of its gas from russia , 80 percent of which flows through ukrainian pipelines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and timoshenko are ready to ink the deal the european union had called the weekend talks the " last and best chance " for both sides to salvage their reputation as reliable suppliers .
the bloc also threatened to review its relations with both russia and ukraine if the dispute were not resolved this weekend . kyiv and moscow have both sought to bring the eu in as an arbitrator in their dispute , but the rushed energy summits was snubbed by western europe , who seemed in angry retreat after a failed bid to broker renewed gas transits one week ago . it was still unclear sunday whether tymoshenko had the backing of her political rival ukrainian president viktor yushchenko for the deal she negotiated in moscow . russia embargoed gas supplies to ukraine on jan .
1 when kyiv balked at paying more for gas in 2009 .
russia then halted all supplies of gas to ukraine on jan .
7 amid accusations that kyiv was stealing gas destined for european customers further downstream . the two sides made no mention of the more than $ 600 million that russia claims ukraine still owes for 2008 supplies . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of their tasks is the issuing of fatwas - religious opinions on islamic law which can serve as behavioral guidelines for muslims in specific situations . for years now , the teachings of imams in germany have been hotly debated . the vast majority -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- are of turkish origin , but there are also imams from morocco and iran .
frequently , imams speak little or no german , nor are they acquainted with the political , social and cultural norms in germany .
many politicians - as well as many muslims living in germany - are now demanding that this situation change . ferid heider grew up in berlin and serves as imam at two of the city 's mosques .
" every muslim can decide for himself who he recognizes as an authority figure , " heider said . as a muslim and an imam , heider is under no obligation to follow the fatwas issued , for example , at the al-azhar university in cairo - one of the most significant educational institutes in the islamic world - or any other scholarly community for that matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is home to a large muslim population his task , he said , is to do the best he can according to knowledge and his conscience .
for him , that means taking the german way of life into account when offering opinions and advice .
a fatwa , he stressed , should always refer to a specific case and set of circumstances . challenges of life in germany heider said he 's often asked by those in his religious community about which behaviors should be permitted or forbidden for muslims .
everyday life in germany is not without conflict for muslims .
prayer times and working hours often do n't mesh , nudity - whether in parks , gyms or the media - is pervasive , and alcohol is freely available . the imam listens to people 's problems , and then refers to the koran and examples from the life of the prophet muhammad .
based on these sources , he then issues an islamic legal opinion . for fatwas issued in europe , heider said it 's important to have " islamic scholars in europe that have either grown up here or have lived here for a long time . "
in his view , only those who are intimately acquainted with the political , social and economic situation of a place can issue adequate fatwas . fatwas issued in germany often vary greatly from those issued in countries with a majority muslim population .
that 's in part due to the nature of a fatwa , says bettina graef , an islamic scholar at berlin 's center for modern oriental studies -lrb- zmo -rrb- .
a fatwa may be a ruling in an individual case , but its significance is often much larger . " everything that 's not forbidden is , in principle , allowed , " said graef .
" and so of course people try to push the boundaries .

in order to prevent this , they issue their own fatwas about how muslims in europe should lead their lives . these fatwas may be issued in far-off countries , but they 're nonetheless a source of concern for law professor and expert on islamic law mathias rohe .
it 's a worrying development , he said , adding that it has its roots in saudi arabia .
imams there have issued opinions demanding that muslims in europe hold themselves apart from what is , in their view , a faithless world . islam is a religion without a highest authority .
there 's no position that is comparable to the catholic pope .
instead , the faithful can choose from a multitude of voices : the imam from the nearest mosque , scholars at al-azhar university , prominent tv sheiks , and superregional fatwa committees .
islamic extremists can just as easily find fatwas to confirm their beliefs as can moderate muslims who believe in peaceful coexistence with members of other religions . islamic organizations representing muslims in germany have also attempted to convince their followers to subscribe to a set of basic principles .
the variety of opinions and degree of individualism hampers muslims ' efforts to successfully represent themselves as a group , said burhan kesici , the secretary general of the islamic council in germany . in his view , having some commonality on fatwas is beneficial to the credibility of islamic spokespeople in germany and europe .

one of their tasks is the issuing of fatwas - religious opinions on islamic law which can serve as behavioral guidelines for muslims in specific situations . for years now , the teachings of imams in germany have been hotly debated . the vast majority -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- are of turkish origin , but there are also imams from morocco and iran .
frequently , imams speak little or no german , nor are they acquainted with the political , social and cultural norms in germany .
many politicians - as well as many muslims living in germany - are now demanding that this situation change . ferid heider grew up in berlin and serves as imam at two of the city 's mosques .
" every muslim can decide for himself who he recognizes as an authority figure , " heider said . as a muslim and an imam , heider is under no obligation to follow the fatwas issued , for example , at the al-azhar university in cairo - one of the most significant educational institutes in the islamic world - or any other scholarly community for that matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is home to a large muslim population his task , he said , is to do the best he can according to knowledge and his conscience .
for him , that means taking the german way of life into account when offering opinions and advice .
a fatwa , he stressed , should always refer to a specific case and set of circumstances . challenges of life in germany heider said he 's often asked by those in his religious community about which behaviors should be permitted or forbidden for muslims .
everyday life in germany is not without conflict for muslims .
prayer times and working hours often do n't mesh , nudity - whether in parks , gyms or the media - is pervasive , and alcohol is freely available . the imam listens to people 's problems , and then refers to the koran and examples from the life of the prophet muhammad .
based on these sources , he then issues an islamic legal opinion . for fatwas issued in europe , heider said it 's important to have " islamic scholars in europe that have either grown up here or have lived here for a long time . "
in his view , only those who are intimately acquainted with the political , social and economic situation of a place can issue adequate fatwas . fatwas issued in germany often vary greatly from those issued in countries with a majority muslim population .
that 's in part due to the nature of a fatwa , says bettina graef , an islamic scholar at berlin 's center for modern oriental studies -lrb- zmo -rrb- .
a fatwa may be a ruling in an individual case , but its significance is often much larger . " everything that 's not forbidden is , in principle , allowed , " said graef .
" and so of course people try to push the boundaries . " fatwas are of central importance to the islamic identity , says graef - an identity that has become particularly important in europe and the us since the 1990s . fatwas imposed from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some aspects of life in germany present dilemmas for muslims many legal scholars in traditional islamic countries view the new islamic practice of law in europe with concern .
they 're worried that their brothers in faith are straying too far from the right path , and may be jeopardizing islam .
in order to prevent this , they issue their own fatwas about how muslims in europe should lead their lives . these fatwas may be issued in far-off countries , but they 're nonetheless a source of concern for law professor and expert on islamic law mathias rohe .
it 's a worrying development , he said , adding that it has its roots in saudi arabia .
imams there have issued opinions demanding that muslims in europe hold themselves apart from what is , in their view , a faithless world . islam is a religion without a highest authority .
there 's no position that is comparable to the catholic pope .
instead , the faithful can choose from a multitude of voices : the imam from the nearest mosque , scholars at al-azhar university , prominent tv sheiks , and superregional fatwa committees .
islamic extremists can just as easily find fatwas to confirm their beliefs as can moderate muslims who believe in peaceful coexistence with members of other religions . islamic organizations representing muslims in germany have also attempted to convince their followers to subscribe to a set of basic principles .
the variety of opinions and degree of individualism hampers muslims ' efforts to successfully represent themselves as a group , said burhan kesici , the secretary general of the islamic council in germany . in his view , having some commonality on fatwas is beneficial to the credibility of islamic spokespeople in germany and europe .
a common islamic organization could very well influence the beliefs of individuals , kesici said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 18.01.2009 muslims in germany seek clarity on religious law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imams consult the koran and draw on the life of muhammad to issue fatwas imams have a strong influence on muslims living in germany .
one of their tasks is the issuing of fatwas - religious opinions on islamic law which can serve as behavioral guidelines for muslims in specific situations . for years now , the teachings of imams in germany have been hotly debated . the vast majority -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- are of turkish origin , but there are also imams from morocco and iran .
frequently , imams speak little or no german , nor are they acquainted with the political , social and cultural norms in germany .
many politicians - as well as many muslims living in germany - are now demanding that this situation change . ferid heider grew up in berlin and serves as imam at two of the city 's mosques .
" every muslim can decide for himself who he recognizes as an authority figure , " heider said . as a muslim and an imam , heider is under no obligation to follow the fatwas issued , for example , at the al-azhar university in cairo - one of the most significant educational institutes in the islamic world - or any other scholarly community for that matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is home to a large muslim population his task , he said , is to do the best he can according to knowledge and his conscience .
for him , that means taking the german way of life into account when offering opinions and advice .
a fatwa , he stressed , should always refer to a specific case and set of circumstances . challenges of life in germany heider said he 's often asked by those in his religious community about which behaviors should be permitted or forbidden for muslims .
everyday life in germany is not without conflict for muslims .
prayer times and working hours often do n't mesh , nudity - whether in parks , gyms or the media - is pervasive , and alcohol is freely available . the imam listens to people 's problems , and then refers to the koran and examples from the life of the prophet muhammad .
based on these sources , he then issues an islamic legal opinion . for fatwas issued in europe , heider said it 's important to have " islamic scholars in europe that have either grown up here or have lived here for a long time . "
in his view , only those who are intimately acquainted with the political , social and economic situation of a place can issue adequate fatwas . fatwas issued in germany often vary greatly from those issued in countries with a majority muslim population .
that 's in part due to the nature of a fatwa , says bettina graef , an islamic scholar at berlin 's center for modern oriental studies -lrb- zmo -rrb- .
a fatwa may be a ruling in an individual case , but its significance is often much larger . " everything that 's not forbidden is , in principle , allowed , " said graef .
" and so of course people try to push the boundaries . " fatwas are of central importance to the islamic identity , says graef - an identity that has become particularly important in europe and the us since the 1990s . fatwas imposed from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some aspects of life in germany present dilemmas for muslims many legal scholars in traditional islamic countries view the new islamic practice of law in europe with concern .
they 're worried that their brothers in faith are straying too far from the right path , and may be jeopardizing islam .
in order to prevent this , they issue their own fatwas about how muslims in europe should lead their lives . these fatwas may be issued in far-off countries , but they 're nonetheless a source of concern for law professor and expert on islamic law mathias rohe .
it 's a worrying development , he said , adding that it has its roots in saudi arabia .
imams there have issued opinions demanding that muslims in europe hold themselves apart from what is , in their view , a faithless world . islam is a religion without a highest authority .
there 's no position that is comparable to the catholic pope .
instead , the faithful can choose from a multitude of voices : the imam from the nearest mosque , scholars at al-azhar university , prominent tv sheiks , and superregional fatwa committees .
islamic extremists can just as easily find fatwas to confirm their beliefs as can moderate muslims who believe in peaceful coexistence with members of other religions . islamic organizations representing muslims in germany have also attempted to convince their followers to subscribe to a set of basic principles .
the variety of opinions and degree of individualism hampers muslims ' efforts to successfully represent themselves as a group , said burhan kesici , the secretary general of the islamic council in germany . in his view , having some commonality on fatwas is beneficial to the credibility of islamic spokespeople in germany and europe .
a common islamic organization could very well influence the beliefs of individuals , kesici said .
in addition , it would make it possible to exclude muslims with extremist views . heiner kiesel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of their tasks is the issuing of fatwas - religious opinions on islamic law which can serve as behavioral guidelines for muslims in specific situations . for years now , the teachings of imams in germany have been hotly debated . the vast majority -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- are of turkish origin , but there are also imams from morocco and iran .
frequently , imams speak little or no german , nor are they acquainted with the political , social and cultural norms in germany .
many politicians - as well as many muslims living in germany - are now demanding that this situation change . ferid heider grew up in berlin and serves as imam at two of the city 's mosques .
" every muslim can decide for himself who he recognizes as an authority figure , " heider said . as a muslim and an imam , heider is under no obligation to follow the fatwas issued , for example , at the al-azhar university in cairo - one of the most significant educational institutes in the islamic world - or any other scholarly community for that matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is home to a large muslim population his task , he said , is to do the best he can according to knowledge and his conscience .
for him , that means taking the german way of life into account when offering opinions and advice .
a fatwa , he stressed , should always refer to a specific case and set of circumstances . challenges of life in germany heider said he 's often asked by those in his religious community about which behaviors should be permitted or forbidden for muslims .
everyday life in germany is not without conflict for muslims .
prayer times and working hours often do n't mesh , nudity - whether in parks , gyms or the media - is pervasive , and alcohol is freely available . the imam listens to people 's problems , and then refers to the koran and examples from the life of the prophet muhammad .
based on these sources , he then issues an islamic legal opinion . for fatwas issued in europe , heider said it 's important to have " islamic scholars in europe that have either grown up here or have lived here for a long time . "
in his view , only those who are intimately acquainted with the political , social and economic situation of a place can issue adequate fatwas . fatwas issued in germany often vary greatly from those issued in countries with a majority muslim population .
that 's in part due to the nature of a fatwa , says bettina graef , an islamic scholar at berlin 's center for modern oriental studies -lrb- zmo -rrb- .
a fatwa may be a ruling in an individual case , but its significance is often much larger . " everything that 's not forbidden is , in principle , allowed , " said graef .
" and so of course people try to push the boundaries . " fatwas are of central importance to the islamic identity , says graef - an identity that has become particularly important in europe and the us since the 1990s . fatwas imposed from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some aspects of life in germany present dilemmas for muslims many legal scholars in traditional islamic countries view the new islamic practice of law in europe with concern .
they 're worried that their brothers in faith are straying too far from the right path , and may be jeopardizing islam .
in order to prevent this , they issue their own fatwas about how muslims in europe should lead their lives . these fatwas may be issued in far-off countries , but they 're nonetheless a source of concern for law professor and expert on islamic law mathias rohe .
it 's a worrying development , he said , adding that it has its roots in saudi arabia .
imams there have issued opinions demanding that muslims in europe hold themselves apart from what is , in their view , a faithless world . islam is a religion without a highest authority .
there 's no position that is comparable to the catholic pope .
instead , the faithful can choose from a multitude of voices : the imam from the nearest mosque , scholars at al-azhar university , prominent tv sheiks , and superregional fatwa committees .
islamic extremists can just as easily find fatwas to confirm their beliefs as can moderate muslims who believe in peaceful coexistence with members of other religions . islamic organizations representing muslims in germany have also attempted to convince their followers to subscribe to a set of basic principles .
the variety of opinions and degree of individualism hampers muslims ' efforts to successfully represent themselves as a group , said burhan kesici , the secretary general of the islamic council in germany . in his view , having some commonality on fatwas is beneficial to the credibility of islamic spokespeople in germany and europe .
a common islamic organization could very well influence the beliefs of individuals , kesici said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 18.01.2009 muslims in germany seek clarity on religious law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imams consult the koran and draw on the life of muhammad to issue fatwas imams have a strong influence on muslims living in germany .
one of their tasks is the issuing of fatwas - religious opinions on islamic law which can serve as behavioral guidelines for muslims in specific situations . for years now , the teachings of imams in germany have been hotly debated . the vast majority -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- are of turkish origin , but there are also imams from morocco and iran .
frequently , imams speak little or no german , nor are they acquainted with the political , social and cultural norms in germany .
many politicians - as well as many muslims living in germany - are now demanding that this situation change . ferid heider grew up in berlin and serves as imam at two of the city 's mosques .
" every muslim can decide for himself who he recognizes as an authority figure , " heider said . as a muslim and an imam , heider is under no obligation to follow the fatwas issued , for example , at the al-azhar university in cairo - one of the most significant educational institutes in the islamic world - or any other scholarly community for that matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is home to a large muslim population his task , he said , is to do the best he can according to knowledge and his conscience .
for him , that means taking the german way of life into account when offering opinions and advice .
a fatwa , he stressed , should always refer to a specific case and set of circumstances . challenges of life in germany heider said he 's often asked by those in his religious community about which behaviors should be permitted or forbidden for muslims .
everyday life in germany is not without conflict for muslims .
prayer times and working hours often do n't mesh , nudity - whether in parks , gyms or the media - is pervasive , and alcohol is freely available . the imam listens to people 's problems , and then refers to the koran and examples from the life of the prophet muhammad .
based on these sources , he then issues an islamic legal opinion . for fatwas issued in europe , heider said it 's important to have " islamic scholars in europe that have either grown up here or have lived here for a long time . "
in his view , only those who are intimately acquainted with the political , social and economic situation of a place can issue adequate fatwas . fatwas issued in germany often vary greatly from those issued in countries with a majority muslim population .
that 's in part due to the nature of a fatwa , says bettina graef , an islamic scholar at berlin 's center for modern oriental studies -lrb- zmo -rrb- .
a fatwa may be a ruling in an individual case , but its significance is often much larger . " everything that 's not forbidden is , in principle , allowed , " said graef .
" and so of course people try to push the boundaries . " fatwas are of central importance to the islamic identity , says graef - an identity that has become particularly important in europe and the us since the 1990s . fatwas imposed from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some aspects of life in germany present dilemmas for muslims many legal scholars in traditional islamic countries view the new islamic practice of law in europe with concern .
they 're worried that their brothers in faith are straying too far from the right path , and may be jeopardizing islam .
in order to prevent this , they issue their own fatwas about how muslims in europe should lead their lives . these fatwas may be issued in far-off countries , but they 're nonetheless a source of concern for law professor and expert on islamic law mathias rohe .
it 's a worrying development , he said , adding that it has its roots in saudi arabia .
imams there have issued opinions demanding that muslims in europe hold themselves apart from what is , in their view , a faithless world . islam is a religion without a highest authority .
there 's no position that is comparable to the catholic pope .
instead , the faithful can choose from a multitude of voices : the imam from the nearest mosque , scholars at al-azhar university , prominent tv sheiks , and superregional fatwa committees .
islamic extremists can just as easily find fatwas to confirm their beliefs as can moderate muslims who believe in peaceful coexistence with members of other religions . islamic organizations representing muslims in germany have also attempted to convince their followers to subscribe to a set of basic principles .
the variety of opinions and degree of individualism hampers muslims ' efforts to successfully represent themselves as a group , said burhan kesici , the secretary general of the islamic council in germany . in his view , having some commonality on fatwas is beneficial to the credibility of islamic spokespeople in germany and europe .
a common islamic organization could very well influence the beliefs of individuals , kesici said .
in addition , it would make it possible to exclude muslims with extremist views . heiner kiesel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of their tasks is the issuing of fatwas - religious opinions on islamic law which can serve as behavioral guidelines for muslims in specific situations . for years now , the teachings of imams in germany have been hotly debated . the vast majority -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- are of turkish origin , but there are also imams from morocco and iran .
frequently , imams speak little or no german , nor are they acquainted with the political , social and cultural norms in germany .
many politicians - as well as many muslims living in germany - are now demanding that this situation change . ferid heider grew up in berlin and serves as imam at two of the city 's mosques .
" every muslim can decide for himself who he recognizes as an authority figure , " heider said . as a muslim and an imam , heider is under no obligation to follow the fatwas issued , for example , at the al-azhar university in cairo - one of the most significant educational institutes in the islamic world - or any other scholarly community for that matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is home to a large muslim population his task , he said , is to do the best he can according to knowledge and his conscience .
for him , that means taking the german way of life into account when offering opinions and advice .
a fatwa , he stressed , should always refer to a specific case and set of circumstances . challenges of life in germany heider said he 's often asked by those in his religious community about which behaviors should be permitted or forbidden for muslims .
everyday life in germany is not without conflict for muslims .
prayer times and working hours often do n't mesh , nudity - whether in parks , gyms or the media - is pervasive , and alcohol is freely available . the imam listens to people 's problems , and then refers to the koran and examples from the life of the prophet muhammad .
based on these sources , he then issues an islamic legal opinion . for fatwas issued in europe , heider said it 's important to have " islamic scholars in europe that have either grown up here or have lived here for a long time . "
in his view , only those who are intimately acquainted with the political , social and economic situation of a place can issue adequate fatwas . fatwas issued in germany often vary greatly from those issued in countries with a majority muslim population .
that 's in part due to the nature of a fatwa , says bettina graef , an islamic scholar at berlin 's center for modern oriental studies -lrb- zmo -rrb- .
a fatwa may be a ruling in an individual case , but its significance is often much larger . " everything that 's not forbidden is , in principle , allowed , " said graef .
" and so of course people try to push the boundaries . " fatwas are of central importance to the islamic identity , says graef - an identity that has become particularly important in europe and the us since the 1990s . fatwas imposed from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some aspects of life in germany present dilemmas for muslims many legal scholars in traditional islamic countries view the new islamic practice of law in europe with concern .
they 're worried that their brothers in faith are straying too far from the right path , and may be jeopardizing islam .
in order to prevent this , they issue their own fatwas about how muslims in europe should lead their lives . these fatwas may be issued in far-off countries , but they 're nonetheless a source of concern for law professor and expert on islamic law mathias rohe .
it 's a worrying development , he said , adding that it has its roots in saudi arabia .
imams there have issued opinions demanding that muslims in europe hold themselves apart from what is , in their view , a faithless world . islam is a religion without a highest authority .
there 's no position that is comparable to the catholic pope .
instead , the faithful can choose from a multitude of voices : the imam from the nearest mosque , scholars at al-azhar university , prominent tv sheiks , and superregional fatwa committees .
islamic extremists can just as easily find fatwas to confirm their beliefs as can moderate muslims who believe in peaceful coexistence with members of other religions . islamic organizations representing muslims in germany have also attempted to convince their followers to subscribe to a set of basic principles .
the variety of opinions and degree of individualism hampers muslims ' efforts to successfully represent themselves as a group , said burhan kesici , the secretary general of the islamic council in germany . in his view , having some commonality on fatwas is beneficial to the credibility of islamic spokespeople in germany and europe .
a common islamic organization could very well influence the beliefs of individuals , kesici said .

one of their tasks is the issuing of fatwas - religious opinions on islamic law which can serve as behavioral guidelines for muslims in specific situations . for years now , the teachings of imams in germany have been hotly debated . the vast majority -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- are of turkish origin , but there are also imams from morocco and iran .
frequently , imams speak little or no german , nor are they acquainted with the political , social and cultural norms in germany .
many politicians - as well as many muslims living in germany - are now demanding that this situation change . ferid heider grew up in berlin and serves as imam at two of the city 's mosques .
" every muslim can decide for himself who he recognizes as an authority figure , " heider said . as a muslim and an imam , heider is under no obligation to follow the fatwas issued , for example , at the al-azhar university in cairo - one of the most significant educational institutes in the islamic world - or any other scholarly community for that matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is home to a large muslim population his task , he said , is to do the best he can according to knowledge and his conscience .
for him , that means taking the german way of life into account when offering opinions and advice .
a fatwa , he stressed , should always refer to a specific case and set of circumstances . challenges of life in germany heider said he 's often asked by those in his religious community about which behaviors should be permitted or forbidden for muslims .
everyday life in germany is not without conflict for muslims .
prayer times and working hours often do n't mesh , nudity - whether in parks , gyms or the media - is pervasive , and alcohol is freely available . the imam listens to people 's problems , and then refers to the koran and examples from the life of the prophet muhammad .
based on these sources , he then issues an islamic legal opinion . for fatwas issued in europe , heider said it 's important to have " islamic scholars in europe that have either grown up here or have lived here for a long time . "
in his view , only those who are intimately acquainted with the political , social and economic situation of a place can issue adequate fatwas . fatwas issued in germany often vary greatly from those issued in countries with a majority muslim population .
that 's in part due to the nature of a fatwa , says bettina graef , an islamic scholar at berlin 's center for modern oriental studies -lrb- zmo -rrb- .
a fatwa may be a ruling in an individual case , but its significance is often much larger . " everything that 's not forbidden is , in principle , allowed , " said graef .
" and so of course people try to push the boundaries . " fatwas are of central importance to the islamic identity , says graef - an identity that has become particularly important in europe and the us since the 1990s . fatwas imposed from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some aspects of life in germany present dilemmas for muslims many legal scholars in traditional islamic countries view the new islamic practice of law in europe with concern .
they 're worried that their brothers in faith are straying too far from the right path , and may be jeopardizing islam .
in order to prevent this , they issue their own fatwas about how muslims in europe should lead their lives . these fatwas may be issued in far-off countries , but they 're nonetheless a source of concern for law professor and expert on islamic law mathias rohe .
it 's a worrying development , he said , adding that it has its roots in saudi arabia .
imams there have issued opinions demanding that muslims in europe hold themselves apart from what is , in their view , a faithless world . islam is a religion without a highest authority .
there 's no position that is comparable to the catholic pope .
instead , the faithful can choose from a multitude of voices : the imam from the nearest mosque , scholars at al-azhar university , prominent tv sheiks , and superregional fatwa committees .
islamic extremists can just as easily find fatwas to confirm their beliefs as can moderate muslims who believe in peaceful coexistence with members of other religions . islamic organizations representing muslims in germany have also attempted to convince their followers to subscribe to a set of basic principles .
the variety of opinions and degree of individualism hampers muslims ' efforts to successfully represent themselves as a group , said burhan kesici , the secretary general of the islamic council in germany . in his view , having some commonality on fatwas is beneficial to the credibility of islamic spokespeople in germany and europe .
a common islamic organization could very well influence the beliefs of individuals , kesici said .
in addition , it would make it possible to exclude muslims with extremist views . heiner kiesel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of their tasks is the issuing of fatwas - religious opinions on islamic law which can serve as behavioral guidelines for muslims in specific situations . for years now , the teachings of imams in germany have been hotly debated . the vast majority -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- are of turkish origin , but there are also imams from morocco and iran .
frequently , imams speak little or no german , nor are they acquainted with the political , social and cultural norms in germany .
many politicians - as well as many muslims living in germany - are now demanding that this situation change . ferid heider grew up in berlin and serves as imam at two of the city 's mosques .
" every muslim can decide for himself who he recognizes as an authority figure , " heider said . as a muslim and an imam , heider is under no obligation to follow the fatwas issued , for example , at the al-azhar university in cairo - one of the most significant educational institutes in the islamic world - or any other scholarly community for that matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is home to a large muslim population his task , he said , is to do the best he can according to knowledge and his conscience .
for him , that means taking the german way of life into account when offering opinions and advice .
a fatwa , he stressed , should always refer to a specific case and set of circumstances . challenges of life in germany heider said he 's often asked by those in his religious community about which behaviors should be permitted or forbidden for muslims .
everyday life in germany is not without conflict for muslims .
prayer times and working hours often do n't mesh , nudity - whether in parks , gyms or the media - is pervasive , and alcohol is freely available . the imam listens to people 's problems , and then refers to the koran and examples from the life of the prophet muhammad .
based on these sources , he then issues an islamic legal opinion . for fatwas issued in europe , heider said it 's important to have " islamic scholars in europe that have either grown up here or have lived here for a long time . "
in his view , only those who are intimately acquainted with the political , social and economic situation of a place can issue adequate fatwas . fatwas issued in germany often vary greatly from those issued in countries with a majority muslim population .
that 's in part due to the nature of a fatwa , says bettina graef , an islamic scholar at berlin 's center for modern oriental studies -lrb- zmo -rrb- .
a fatwa may be a ruling in an individual case , but its significance is often much larger . " everything that 's not forbidden is , in principle , allowed , " said graef .
" and so of course people try to push the boundaries . " fatwas are of central importance to the islamic identity , says graef - an identity that has become particularly important in europe and the us since the 1990s . fatwas imposed from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some aspects of life in germany present dilemmas for muslims many legal scholars in traditional islamic countries view the new islamic practice of law in europe with concern .
they 're worried that their brothers in faith are straying too far from the right path , and may be jeopardizing islam .
in order to prevent this , they issue their own fatwas about how muslims in europe should lead their lives . these fatwas may be issued in far-off countries , but they 're nonetheless a source of concern for law professor and expert on islamic law mathias rohe .
it 's a worrying development , he said , adding that it has its roots in saudi arabia .
imams there have issued opinions demanding that muslims in europe hold themselves apart from what is , in their view , a faithless world . islam is a religion without a highest authority .
there 's no position that is comparable to the catholic pope .
instead , the faithful can choose from a multitude of voices : the imam from the nearest mosque , scholars at al-azhar university , prominent tv sheiks , and superregional fatwa committees .
islamic extremists can just as easily find fatwas to confirm their beliefs as can moderate muslims who believe in peaceful coexistence with members of other religions . islamic organizations representing muslims in germany have also attempted to convince their followers to subscribe to a set of basic principles .
the variety of opinions and degree of individualism hampers muslims ' efforts to successfully represent themselves as a group , said burhan kesici , the secretary general of the islamic council in germany . in his view , having some commonality on fatwas is beneficial to the credibility of islamic spokespeople in germany and europe .
a common islamic organization could very well influence the beliefs of individuals , kesici said .

one of their tasks is the issuing of fatwas - religious opinions on islamic law which can serve as behavioral guidelines for muslims in specific situations . for years now , the teachings of imams in germany have been hotly debated . the vast majority -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- are of turkish origin , but there are also imams from morocco and iran .
frequently , imams speak little or no german , nor are they acquainted with the political , social and cultural norms in germany .
many politicians - as well as many muslims living in germany - are now demanding that this situation change . ferid heider grew up in berlin and serves as imam at two of the city 's mosques .
" every muslim can decide for himself who he recognizes as an authority figure , " heider said . as a muslim and an imam , heider is under no obligation to follow the fatwas issued , for example , at the al-azhar university in cairo - one of the most significant educational institutes in the islamic world - or any other scholarly community for that matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is home to a large muslim population his task , he said , is to do the best he can according to knowledge and his conscience .
for him , that means taking the german way of life into account when offering opinions and advice .
a fatwa , he stressed , should always refer to a specific case and set of circumstances . challenges of life in germany heider said he 's often asked by those in his religious community about which behaviors should be permitted or forbidden for muslims .
everyday life in germany is not without conflict for muslims .
prayer times and working hours often do n't mesh , nudity - whether in parks , gyms or the media - is pervasive , and alcohol is freely available . the imam listens to people 's problems , and then refers to the koran and examples from the life of the prophet muhammad .
based on these sources , he then issues an islamic legal opinion . for fatwas issued in europe , heider said it 's important to have " islamic scholars in europe that have either grown up here or have lived here for a long time . "
in his view , only those who are intimately acquainted with the political , social and economic situation of a place can issue adequate fatwas . fatwas issued in germany often vary greatly from those issued in countries with a majority muslim population .
that 's in part due to the nature of a fatwa , says bettina graef , an islamic scholar at berlin 's center for modern oriental studies -lrb- zmo -rrb- .
a fatwa may be a ruling in an individual case , but its significance is often much larger . " everything that 's not forbidden is , in principle , allowed , " said graef .
" and so of course people try to push the boundaries . " fatwas are of central importance to the islamic identity , says graef - an identity that has become particularly important in europe and the us since the 1990s . fatwas imposed from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some aspects of life in germany present dilemmas for muslims many legal scholars in traditional islamic countries view the new islamic practice of law in europe with concern .
they 're worried that their brothers in faith are straying too far from the right path , and may be jeopardizing islam .
in order to prevent this , they issue their own fatwas about how muslims in europe should lead their lives . these fatwas may be issued in far-off countries , but they 're nonetheless a source of concern for law professor and expert on islamic law mathias rohe .
it 's a worrying development , he said , adding that it has its roots in saudi arabia .
imams there have issued opinions demanding that muslims in europe hold themselves apart from what is , in their view , a faithless world . islam is a religion without a highest authority .
there 's no position that is comparable to the catholic pope .
instead , the faithful can choose from a multitude of voices : the imam from the nearest mosque , scholars at al-azhar university , prominent tv sheiks , and superregional fatwa committees .
islamic extremists can just as easily find fatwas to confirm their beliefs as can moderate muslims who believe in peaceful coexistence with members of other religions . islamic organizations representing muslims in germany have also attempted to convince their followers to subscribe to a set of basic principles .
the variety of opinions and degree of individualism hampers muslims ' efforts to successfully represent themselves as a group , said burhan kesici , the secretary general of the islamic council in germany . in his view , having some commonality on fatwas is beneficial to the credibility of islamic spokespeople in germany and europe .
a common islamic organization could very well influence the beliefs of individuals , kesici said .

one of their tasks is the issuing of fatwas - religious opinions on islamic law which can serve as behavioral guidelines for muslims in specific situations . for years now , the teachings of imams in germany have been hotly debated . the vast majority -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- are of turkish origin , but there are also imams from morocco and iran .
frequently , imams speak little or no german , nor are they acquainted with the political , social and cultural norms in germany .
many politicians - as well as many muslims living in germany - are now demanding that this situation change . ferid heider grew up in berlin and serves as imam at two of the city 's mosques .
" every muslim can decide for himself who he recognizes as an authority figure , " heider said . as a muslim and an imam , heider is under no obligation to follow the fatwas issued , for example , at the al-azhar university in cairo - one of the most significant educational institutes in the islamic world - or any other scholarly community for that matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is home to a large muslim population his task , he said , is to do the best he can according to knowledge and his conscience .
for him , that means taking the german way of life into account when offering opinions and advice .
a fatwa , he stressed , should always refer to a specific case and set of circumstances . challenges of life in germany heider said he 's often asked by those in his religious community about which behaviors should be permitted or forbidden for muslims .
everyday life in germany is not without conflict for muslims .
prayer times and working hours often do n't mesh , nudity - whether in parks , gyms or the media - is pervasive , and alcohol is freely available . the imam listens to people 's problems , and then refers to the koran and examples from the life of the prophet muhammad .
based on these sources , he then issues an islamic legal opinion . for fatwas issued in europe , heider said it 's important to have " islamic scholars in europe that have either grown up here or have lived here for a long time . "
in his view , only those who are intimately acquainted with the political , social and economic situation of a place can issue adequate fatwas . fatwas issued in germany often vary greatly from those issued in countries with a majority muslim population .
that 's in part due to the nature of a fatwa , says bettina graef , an islamic scholar at berlin 's center for modern oriental studies -lrb- zmo -rrb- .
a fatwa may be a ruling in an individual case , but its significance is often much larger . " everything that 's not forbidden is , in principle , allowed , " said graef .
" and so of course people try to push the boundaries . " fatwas are of central importance to the islamic identity , says graef - an identity that has become particularly important in europe and the us since the 1990s . fatwas imposed from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some aspects of life in germany present dilemmas for muslims many legal scholars in traditional islamic countries view the new islamic practice of law in europe with concern .
they 're worried that their brothers in faith are straying too far from the right path , and may be jeopardizing islam .
in order to prevent this , they issue their own fatwas about how muslims in europe should lead their lives . these fatwas may be issued in far-off countries , but they 're nonetheless a source of concern for law professor and expert on islamic law mathias rohe .
it 's a worrying development , he said , adding that it has its roots in saudi arabia .
imams there have issued opinions demanding that muslims in europe hold themselves apart from what is , in their view , a faithless world . islam is a religion without a highest authority .
there 's no position that is comparable to the catholic pope .
instead , the faithful can choose from a multitude of voices : the imam from the nearest mosque , scholars at al-azhar university , prominent tv sheiks , and superregional fatwa committees .
islamic extremists can just as easily find fatwas to confirm their beliefs as can moderate muslims who believe in peaceful coexistence with members of other religions . islamic organizations representing muslims in germany have also attempted to convince their followers to subscribe to a set of basic principles .
the variety of opinions and degree of individualism hampers muslims ' efforts to successfully represent themselves as a group , said burhan kesici , the secretary general of the islamic council in germany . in his view , having some commonality on fatwas is beneficial to the credibility of islamic spokespeople in germany and europe .
a common islamic organization could very well influence the beliefs of individuals , kesici said .
in addition , it would make it possible to exclude muslims with extremist views . heiner kiesel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , to end the gas crisis , which has blocked shipments of russian gas to ukraine and much of western europe since the beginning of the year . in a statement issued sunday , the european commission welcomed the agreement , but said it remained to be seen whether gas would actually arrive in europe in the coming days . experts have said it could take up to three days for gas supplies to reach europe and for pressure to return to normal in pipelines after the taps are opened .
for some countries which have nearly run out of reserve supplies , this could continue to create short-term problems . under the agreement , ukraine would be offered a 20-percent discount on the market price for russian gas deliveries this year , if it agrees to keep transits fees for pumping gas to europe via its pipelines at the 2008 level .
for ukraine , this still means a substantial increase in the first quarter . putin said both countries would switch to european market prices in their gas trade starting in 2010 . eu was getting anxious europe receives a quarter of its gas from russia , 80 percent of which flows through ukrainian pipelines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and timoshenko are ready to ink the deal the european union had called the weekend talks the " last and best chance " for both sides to salvage their reputation as reliable suppliers .
the bloc also threatened to review its relations with both russia and ukraine if the dispute were not resolved this weekend . kyiv and moscow have both sought to bring the eu in as an arbitrator in their dispute , but the rushed energy summits was snubbed by western europe , who seemed in angry retreat after a failed bid to broker renewed gas transits one week ago . it was still unclear sunday whether tymoshenko had the backing of her political rival ukrainian president viktor yushchenko for the deal she negotiated in moscow . russia embargoed gas supplies to ukraine on jan .
1 when kyiv balked at paying more for gas in 2009 .
russia then halted all supplies of gas to ukraine on jan .
7 amid accusations that kyiv was stealing gas destined for european customers further downstream . the two sides made no mention of the more than $ 600 million that russia claims ukraine still owes for 2008 supplies . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but issues like afghanistan , the environment and the auto industry are likely to cause friction soon . when barack obama raises his right hand on tuesday and takes the presidential oath , a new era will begin .
his eloquence and charisma alone are bound to bring the new style that many - both in the us and abroad - are hoping for after george w. bush 's term draws to a close . however , the situation is n't simple .
the us is currently facing the worst economic crisis since the 1930s .
its military is involved in two wars .
from the middle east to north korea , foreign policy is difficult at best .
during the presidential race , ambitious domestic projects were promised , like health care reform and a new energy policy . great expectations the man who now has it all on his shoulders is 47 years old , has no experience in government , and has n't even completed a full legislature period in the us senate . nevertheless , expectations are high - particularly from abroad .
germany 's hopes in obama were clearly evident when he visited berlin in july 2008 and a crowd of 200,000 fans gave him a rock star 's welcome at the city 's victory column .
he was visibly moved to see so many in the german capital shouting , " yes we can ! " this euphoria was topped during the election on nov .
4 .
millions of germans joined in the party fever , making for the most exciting election night germany had ever seen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his first priority is the united states one visitor at an election party in germany summed up the feeling : " if he accomplishes only half of the things he 's promised , then that will be a giant step forward for the whole world - and i 'm extremely happy about that ! " even german president horst koehler took a similar position , though he expressed it a bit more calmly . " this is a great opportunity to fill the german-american relationship with more convincing content , " said koehler .
" it 's an opportunity for the united states of america , for germany and for the whole world . " stickling point afghanistan it wo n't be easy for the 44th american president to please the whole world .
after all , not only does he not have any superpowers , he is also responsible first and foremost to his own countrymen , pointed out bonn-based political scientist christian hacke . some of obama 's ideas do n't align with those of the german government as well as many people think .
there are considerable differences of opinion when it comes to the german military 's participation in afghanistan , for example . the future us government has already said it wants more german soldiers in hindu kush , a position not shared by berlin . " obama 's advisors know that in an election year there wo n't be a majority in support of sending german troops to the south and they wo n't even demand it , " said karsten voigt , berlin 's coordinator for german-american relations . it remains to be seen whether obama and his team really will , in fact , be so sensitive .
the white house may be getting a new resident , but many key positions in washington - in the secret service , the military and the banking sector , for example - are n't changing hands . obama 's green soul cooperation on the environment appears somewhat less problematic .
obama did n't hide his ecological leanings during the campaign , which was cause for optimism among germany 's political party the greens . " president obama will , above all , have to create new jobs and to do that he 'll need a sector with gigantic growth potential , " said greens faction leader fritz kuhn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is concerned that a us auto bailout would hurt competition " that is ecological modernization , " he added .
" as far as energy policy goes , the us is so far behind that he can and will be able to create millions of jobs . " car competition warning the labor market is hurting in particular due to jobs lost in the auto industry .
unlike their german competitors , the large us carmakers have depended on heavily polluting gas-guzzlers for far too long . chancellor angela merkel has expressed concern that struggles in the auto branch could lead to tension in german-american relations .
she said she would have some " very serious conversations " with obama , should german carmakers be competitively disadvantaged through us bailout efforts . despite a few bumps along the way , german-american ties have always been harmonious and reconciliatory .
as christian hacke put it , the only real problems will arise if germany starts placing unreasonable expectations on the new president . frank gazon -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , to end the gas crisis , which has blocked shipments of russian gas to ukraine and much of western europe since the beginning of the year . in a statement issued sunday , the european commission welcomed the agreement , but said it remained to be seen whether gas would actually arrive in europe in the coming days . experts have said it could take up to three days for gas supplies to reach europe and for pressure to return to normal in pipelines after the taps are opened .
for some countries which have nearly run out of reserve supplies , this could continue to create short-term problems . under the agreement , ukraine would be offered a 20-percent discount on the market price for russian gas deliveries this year , if it agrees to keep transits fees for pumping gas to europe via its pipelines at the 2008 level .
for ukraine , this still means a substantial increase in the first quarter . putin said both countries would switch to european market prices in their gas trade starting in 2010 . eu was getting anxious europe receives a quarter of its gas from russia , 80 percent of which flows through ukrainian pipelines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and timoshenko are ready to ink the deal the european union had called the weekend talks the " last and best chance " for both sides to salvage their reputation as reliable suppliers .
the bloc also threatened to review its relations with both russia and ukraine if the dispute were not resolved this weekend . kyiv and moscow have both sought to bring the eu in as an arbitrator in their dispute , but the rushed energy summits was snubbed by western europe , who seemed in angry retreat after a failed bid to broker renewed gas transits one week ago . it was still unclear sunday whether tymoshenko had the backing of her political rival ukrainian president viktor yushchenko for the deal she negotiated in moscow . russia embargoed gas supplies to ukraine on jan .
1 when kyiv balked at paying more for gas in 2009 .
russia then halted all supplies of gas to ukraine on jan .

but issues like afghanistan , the environment and the auto industry are likely to cause friction soon . when barack obama raises his right hand on tuesday and takes the presidential oath , a new era will begin .
his eloquence and charisma alone are bound to bring the new style that many - both in the us and abroad - are hoping for after george w. bush 's term draws to a close . however , the situation is n't simple .
the us is currently facing the worst economic crisis since the 1930s .
its military is involved in two wars .
from the middle east to north korea , foreign policy is difficult at best .
during the presidential race , ambitious domestic projects were promised , like health care reform and a new energy policy . great expectations the man who now has it all on his shoulders is 47 years old , has no experience in government , and has n't even completed a full legislature period in the us senate . nevertheless , expectations are high - particularly from abroad .
germany 's hopes in obama were clearly evident when he visited berlin in july 2008 and a crowd of 200,000 fans gave him a rock star 's welcome at the city 's victory column .
he was visibly moved to see so many in the german capital shouting , " yes we can ! " this euphoria was topped during the election on nov .
4 .
millions of germans joined in the party fever , making for the most exciting election night germany had ever seen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his first priority is the united states one visitor at an election party in germany summed up the feeling : " if he accomplishes only half of the things he 's promised , then that will be a giant step forward for the whole world - and i 'm extremely happy about that ! " even german president horst koehler took a similar position , though he expressed it a bit more calmly . " this is a great opportunity to fill the german-american relationship with more convincing content , " said koehler .
" it 's an opportunity for the united states of america , for germany and for the whole world . " stickling point afghanistan it wo n't be easy for the 44th american president to please the whole world .
after all , not only does he not have any superpowers , he is also responsible first and foremost to his own countrymen , pointed out bonn-based political scientist christian hacke . some of obama 's ideas do n't align with those of the german government as well as many people think .
there are considerable differences of opinion when it comes to the german military 's participation in afghanistan , for example . the future us government has already said it wants more german soldiers in hindu kush , a position not shared by berlin . " obama 's advisors know that in an election year there wo n't be a majority in support of sending german troops to the south and they wo n't even demand it , " said karsten voigt , berlin 's coordinator for german-american relations . it remains to be seen whether obama and his team really will , in fact , be so sensitive .
the white house may be getting a new resident , but many key positions in washington - in the secret service , the military and the banking sector , for example - are n't changing hands . obama 's green soul cooperation on the environment appears somewhat less problematic .
obama did n't hide his ecological leanings during the campaign , which was cause for optimism among germany 's political party the greens . " president obama will , above all , have to create new jobs and to do that he 'll need a sector with gigantic growth potential , " said greens faction leader fritz kuhn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is concerned that a us auto bailout would hurt competition " that is ecological modernization , " he added .
" as far as energy policy goes , the us is so far behind that he can and will be able to create millions of jobs . " car competition warning the labor market is hurting in particular due to jobs lost in the auto industry .
unlike their german competitors , the large us carmakers have depended on heavily polluting gas-guzzlers for far too long . chancellor angela merkel has expressed concern that struggles in the auto branch could lead to tension in german-american relations .
she said she would have some " very serious conversations " with obama , should german carmakers be competitively disadvantaged through us bailout efforts . despite a few bumps along the way , german-american ties have always been harmonious and reconciliatory .
as christian hacke put it , the only real problems will arise if germany starts placing unreasonable expectations on the new president . frank gazon -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of their tasks is the issuing of fatwas - religious opinions on islamic law which can serve as behavioral guidelines for muslims in specific situations . for years now , the teachings of imams in germany have been hotly debated . the vast majority -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- are of turkish origin , but there are also imams from morocco and iran .
frequently , imams speak little or no german , nor are they acquainted with the political , social and cultural norms in germany .
many politicians - as well as many muslims living in germany - are now demanding that this situation change . ferid heider grew up in berlin and serves as imam at two of the city 's mosques .
" every muslim can decide for himself who he recognizes as an authority figure , " heider said . as a muslim and an imam , heider is under no obligation to follow the fatwas issued , for example , at the al-azhar university in cairo - one of the most significant educational institutes in the islamic world - or any other scholarly community for that matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is home to a large muslim population his task , he said , is to do the best he can according to knowledge and his conscience .
for him , that means taking the german way of life into account when offering opinions and advice .
a fatwa , he stressed , should always refer to a specific case and set of circumstances . challenges of life in germany heider said he 's often asked by those in his religious community about which behaviors should be permitted or forbidden for muslims .
everyday life in germany is not without conflict for muslims .
prayer times and working hours often do n't mesh , nudity - whether in parks , gyms or the media - is pervasive , and alcohol is freely available . the imam listens to people 's problems , and then refers to the koran and examples from the life of the prophet muhammad .
based on these sources , he then issues an islamic legal opinion . for fatwas issued in europe , heider said it 's important to have " islamic scholars in europe that have either grown up here or have lived here for a long time . "
in his view , only those who are intimately acquainted with the political , social and economic situation of a place can issue adequate fatwas . fatwas issued in germany often vary greatly from those issued in countries with a majority muslim population .
that 's in part due to the nature of a fatwa , says bettina graef , an islamic scholar at berlin 's center for modern oriental studies -lrb- zmo -rrb- .
a fatwa may be a ruling in an individual case , but its significance is often much larger . " everything that 's not forbidden is , in principle , allowed , " said graef .

in order to prevent this , they issue their own fatwas about how muslims in europe should lead their lives . these fatwas may be issued in far-off countries , but they 're nonetheless a source of concern for law professor and expert on islamic law mathias rohe .
it 's a worrying development , he said , adding that it has its roots in saudi arabia .
imams there have issued opinions demanding that muslims in europe hold themselves apart from what is , in their view , a faithless world . islam is a religion without a highest authority .
there 's no position that is comparable to the catholic pope .
instead , the faithful can choose from a multitude of voices : the imam from the nearest mosque , scholars at al-azhar university , prominent tv sheiks , and superregional fatwa committees .
islamic extremists can just as easily find fatwas to confirm their beliefs as can moderate muslims who believe in peaceful coexistence with members of other religions . islamic organizations representing muslims in germany have also attempted to convince their followers to subscribe to a set of basic principles .
the variety of opinions and degree of individualism hampers muslims ' efforts to successfully represent themselves as a group , said burhan kesici , the secretary general of the islamic council in germany . in his view , having some commonality on fatwas is beneficial to the credibility of islamic spokespeople in germany and europe .

one of their tasks is the issuing of fatwas - religious opinions on islamic law which can serve as behavioral guidelines for muslims in specific situations . for years now , the teachings of imams in germany have been hotly debated . the vast majority -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- are of turkish origin , but there are also imams from morocco and iran .
frequently , imams speak little or no german , nor are they acquainted with the political , social and cultural norms in germany .
many politicians - as well as many muslims living in germany - are now demanding that this situation change . ferid heider grew up in berlin and serves as imam at two of the city 's mosques .
" every muslim can decide for himself who he recognizes as an authority figure , " heider said . as a muslim and an imam , heider is under no obligation to follow the fatwas issued , for example , at the al-azhar university in cairo - one of the most significant educational institutes in the islamic world - or any other scholarly community for that matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is home to a large muslim population his task , he said , is to do the best he can according to knowledge and his conscience .
for him , that means taking the german way of life into account when offering opinions and advice .
a fatwa , he stressed , should always refer to a specific case and set of circumstances . challenges of life in germany heider said he 's often asked by those in his religious community about which behaviors should be permitted or forbidden for muslims .
everyday life in germany is not without conflict for muslims .
prayer times and working hours often do n't mesh , nudity - whether in parks , gyms or the media - is pervasive , and alcohol is freely available . the imam listens to people 's problems , and then refers to the koran and examples from the life of the prophet muhammad .
based on these sources , he then issues an islamic legal opinion . for fatwas issued in europe , heider said it 's important to have " islamic scholars in europe that have either grown up here or have lived here for a long time . "
in his view , only those who are intimately acquainted with the political , social and economic situation of a place can issue adequate fatwas . fatwas issued in germany often vary greatly from those issued in countries with a majority muslim population .
that 's in part due to the nature of a fatwa , says bettina graef , an islamic scholar at berlin 's center for modern oriental studies -lrb- zmo -rrb- .
a fatwa may be a ruling in an individual case , but its significance is often much larger . " everything that 's not forbidden is , in principle , allowed , " said graef .
" and so of course people try to push the boundaries . " fatwas are of central importance to the islamic identity , says graef - an identity that has become particularly important in europe and the us since the 1990s . fatwas imposed from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some aspects of life in germany present dilemmas for muslims many legal scholars in traditional islamic countries view the new islamic practice of law in europe with concern .
they 're worried that their brothers in faith are straying too far from the right path , and may be jeopardizing islam .
in order to prevent this , they issue their own fatwas about how muslims in europe should lead their lives . these fatwas may be issued in far-off countries , but they 're nonetheless a source of concern for law professor and expert on islamic law mathias rohe .
it 's a worrying development , he said , adding that it has its roots in saudi arabia .
imams there have issued opinions demanding that muslims in europe hold themselves apart from what is , in their view , a faithless world . islam is a religion without a highest authority .
there 's no position that is comparable to the catholic pope .
instead , the faithful can choose from a multitude of voices : the imam from the nearest mosque , scholars at al-azhar university , prominent tv sheiks , and superregional fatwa committees .
islamic extremists can just as easily find fatwas to confirm their beliefs as can moderate muslims who believe in peaceful coexistence with members of other religions . islamic organizations representing muslims in germany have also attempted to convince their followers to subscribe to a set of basic principles .
the variety of opinions and degree of individualism hampers muslims ' efforts to successfully represent themselves as a group , said burhan kesici , the secretary general of the islamic council in germany . in his view , having some commonality on fatwas is beneficial to the credibility of islamic spokespeople in germany and europe .
a common islamic organization could very well influence the beliefs of individuals , kesici said .
in addition , it would make it possible to exclude muslims with extremist views . heiner kiesel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , to end the gas crisis , which has blocked shipments of russian gas to ukraine and much of western europe since the beginning of the year . in a statement issued sunday , the european commission welcomed the agreement , but said it remained to be seen whether gas would actually arrive in europe in the coming days . experts have said it could take up to three days for gas supplies to reach europe and for pressure to return to normal in pipelines after the taps are opened .
for some countries which have nearly run out of reserve supplies , this could continue to create short-term problems . under the agreement , ukraine would be offered a 20-percent discount on the market price for russian gas deliveries this year , if it agrees to keep transits fees for pumping gas to europe via its pipelines at the 2008 level .
for ukraine , this still means a substantial increase in the first quarter . putin said both countries would switch to european market prices in their gas trade starting in 2010 . eu was getting anxious europe receives a quarter of its gas from russia , 80 percent of which flows through ukrainian pipelines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and timoshenko are ready to ink the deal the european union had called the weekend talks the " last and best chance " for both sides to salvage their reputation as reliable suppliers .
the bloc also threatened to review its relations with both russia and ukraine if the dispute were not resolved this weekend . kyiv and moscow have both sought to bring the eu in as an arbitrator in their dispute , but the rushed energy summits was snubbed by western europe , who seemed in angry retreat after a failed bid to broker renewed gas transits one week ago . it was still unclear sunday whether tymoshenko had the backing of her political rival ukrainian president viktor yushchenko for the deal she negotiated in moscow . russia embargoed gas supplies to ukraine on jan .

russia then halted all supplies of gas to ukraine on jan .

israel meanwhile hinted it was ready for a swift withdrawal . the summit leaders stressed the importance of lifting the blockade of gaza so that humanitarian aid can enter , ending weapons smuggling , and of creating a unified palestinian state for the sake of transforming sunday morning 's ceasefire into a lasting peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 18.01.2009 muslims in germany seek clarity on religious law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imams consult the koran and draw on the life of muhammad to issue fatwas imams have a strong influence on muslims living in germany .
one of their tasks is the issuing of fatwas - religious opinions on islamic law which can serve as behavioral guidelines for muslims in specific situations . for years now , the teachings of imams in germany have been hotly debated . the vast majority -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- are of turkish origin , but there are also imams from morocco and iran .
frequently , imams speak little or no german , nor are they acquainted with the political , social and cultural norms in germany .
many politicians - as well as many muslims living in germany - are now demanding that this situation change . ferid heider grew up in berlin and serves as imam at two of the city 's mosques .
" every muslim can decide for himself who he recognizes as an authority figure , " heider said . as a muslim and an imam , heider is under no obligation to follow the fatwas issued , for example , at the al-azhar university in cairo - one of the most significant educational institutes in the islamic world - or any other scholarly community for that matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is home to a large muslim population his task , he said , is to do the best he can according to knowledge and his conscience .
for him , that means taking the german way of life into account when offering opinions and advice .
a fatwa , he stressed , should always refer to a specific case and set of circumstances . challenges of life in germany heider said he 's often asked by those in his religious community about which behaviors should be permitted or forbidden for muslims .
everyday life in germany is not without conflict for muslims .
prayer times and working hours often do n't mesh , nudity - whether in parks , gyms or the media - is pervasive , and alcohol is freely available . the imam listens to people 's problems , and then refers to the koran and examples from the life of the prophet muhammad .
based on these sources , he then issues an islamic legal opinion . for fatwas issued in europe , heider said it 's important to have " islamic scholars in europe that have either grown up here or have lived here for a long time . "
in his view , only those who are intimately acquainted with the political , social and economic situation of a place can issue adequate fatwas . fatwas issued in germany often vary greatly from those issued in countries with a majority muslim population .
that 's in part due to the nature of a fatwa , says bettina graef , an islamic scholar at berlin 's center for modern oriental studies -lrb- zmo -rrb- .
a fatwa may be a ruling in an individual case , but its significance is often much larger . " everything that 's not forbidden is , in principle , allowed , " said graef .
" and so of course people try to push the boundaries . " fatwas are of central importance to the islamic identity , says graef - an identity that has become particularly important in europe and the us since the 1990s . fatwas imposed from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some aspects of life in germany present dilemmas for muslims many legal scholars in traditional islamic countries view the new islamic practice of law in europe with concern .
they 're worried that their brothers in faith are straying too far from the right path , and may be jeopardizing islam .
in order to prevent this , they issue their own fatwas about how muslims in europe should lead their lives . these fatwas may be issued in far-off countries , but they 're nonetheless a source of concern for law professor and expert on islamic law mathias rohe .
it 's a worrying development , he said , adding that it has its roots in saudi arabia .
imams there have issued opinions demanding that muslims in europe hold themselves apart from what is , in their view , a faithless world . islam is a religion without a highest authority .
there 's no position that is comparable to the catholic pope .
instead , the faithful can choose from a multitude of voices : the imam from the nearest mosque , scholars at al-azhar university , prominent tv sheiks , and superregional fatwa committees .
islamic extremists can just as easily find fatwas to confirm their beliefs as can moderate muslims who believe in peaceful coexistence with members of other religions . islamic organizations representing muslims in germany have also attempted to convince their followers to subscribe to a set of basic principles .
the variety of opinions and degree of individualism hampers muslims ' efforts to successfully represent themselves as a group , said burhan kesici , the secretary general of the islamic council in germany . in his view , having some commonality on fatwas is beneficial to the credibility of islamic spokespeople in germany and europe .
a common islamic organization could very well influence the beliefs of individuals , kesici said .
in addition , it would make it possible to exclude muslims with extremist views . heiner kiesel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but issues like afghanistan , the environment and the auto industry are likely to cause friction soon . when barack obama raises his right hand on tuesday and takes the presidential oath , a new era will begin .
his eloquence and charisma alone are bound to bring the new style that many - both in the us and abroad - are hoping for after george w. bush 's term draws to a close . however , the situation is n't simple .
the us is currently facing the worst economic crisis since the 1930s .
its military is involved in two wars .
from the middle east to north korea , foreign policy is difficult at best .
during the presidential race , ambitious domestic projects were promised , like health care reform and a new energy policy . great expectations the man who now has it all on his shoulders is 47 years old , has no experience in government , and has n't even completed a full legislature period in the us senate . nevertheless , expectations are high - particularly from abroad .
germany 's hopes in obama were clearly evident when he visited berlin in july 2008 and a crowd of 200,000 fans gave him a rock star 's welcome at the city 's victory column .
he was visibly moved to see so many in the german capital shouting , " yes we can ! " this euphoria was topped during the election on nov .
4 .
millions of germans joined in the party fever , making for the most exciting election night germany had ever seen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his first priority is the united states one visitor at an election party in germany summed up the feeling : " if he accomplishes only half of the things he 's promised , then that will be a giant step forward for the whole world - and i 'm extremely happy about that ! " even german president horst koehler took a similar position , though he expressed it a bit more calmly . " this is a great opportunity to fill the german-american relationship with more convincing content , " said koehler .
" it 's an opportunity for the united states of america , for germany and for the whole world . " stickling point afghanistan it wo n't be easy for the 44th american president to please the whole world .
after all , not only does he not have any superpowers , he is also responsible first and foremost to his own countrymen , pointed out bonn-based political scientist christian hacke . some of obama 's ideas do n't align with those of the german government as well as many people think .
there are considerable differences of opinion when it comes to the german military 's participation in afghanistan , for example . the future us government has already said it wants more german soldiers in hindu kush , a position not shared by berlin . " obama 's advisors know that in an election year there wo n't be a majority in support of sending german troops to the south and they wo n't even demand it , " said karsten voigt , berlin 's coordinator for german-american relations . it remains to be seen whether obama and his team really will , in fact , be so sensitive .
the white house may be getting a new resident , but many key positions in washington - in the secret service , the military and the banking sector , for example - are n't changing hands . obama 's green soul cooperation on the environment appears somewhat less problematic .
obama did n't hide his ecological leanings during the campaign , which was cause for optimism among germany 's political party the greens . " president obama will , above all , have to create new jobs and to do that he 'll need a sector with gigantic growth potential , " said greens faction leader fritz kuhn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is concerned that a us auto bailout would hurt competition " that is ecological modernization , " he added .
" as far as energy policy goes , the us is so far behind that he can and will be able to create millions of jobs . " car competition warning the labor market is hurting in particular due to jobs lost in the auto industry .
unlike their german competitors , the large us carmakers have depended on heavily polluting gas-guzzlers for far too long . chancellor angela merkel has expressed concern that struggles in the auto branch could lead to tension in german-american relations .
she said she would have some " very serious conversations " with obama , should german carmakers be competitively disadvantaged through us bailout efforts . despite a few bumps along the way , german-american ties have always been harmonious and reconciliatory .
as christian hacke put it , the only real problems will arise if germany starts placing unreasonable expectations on the new president . frank gazon -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

israel meanwhile hinted it was ready for a swift withdrawal . the summit leaders stressed the importance of lifting the blockade of gaza so that humanitarian aid can enter , ending weapons smuggling , and of creating a unified palestinian state for the sake of transforming sunday morning 's ceasefire into a lasting peace . " we are witnessing today the beginning of the end of this crisis , " egyptian president hosni mubarak , who hosted the summit alongside french president nicolas sarkozy , told reporters on sunday . " we look forward to the end of this sad page from our history , " the egyptian president said .
" a lasting and a just peace is the only way to achieve the security of the people of this region , and a palestinian state is the only way to achieve this peace .

19 , to end the gas crisis , which has blocked shipments of russian gas to ukraine and much of western europe since the beginning of the year . in a statement issued sunday , the european commission welcomed the agreement , but said it remained to be seen whether gas would actually arrive in europe in the coming days . experts have said it could take up to three days for gas supplies to reach europe and for pressure to return to normal in pipelines after the taps are opened .
for some countries which have nearly run out of reserve supplies , this could continue to create short-term problems . under the agreement , ukraine would be offered a 20-percent discount on the market price for russian gas deliveries this year , if it agrees to keep transits fees for pumping gas to europe via its pipelines at the 2008 level .
for ukraine , this still means a substantial increase in the first quarter . putin said both countries would switch to european market prices in their gas trade starting in 2010 . eu was getting anxious europe receives a quarter of its gas from russia , 80 percent of which flows through ukrainian pipelines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and timoshenko are ready to ink the deal the european union had called the weekend talks the " last and best chance " for both sides to salvage their reputation as reliable suppliers .
the bloc also threatened to review its relations with both russia and ukraine if the dispute were not resolved this weekend . kyiv and moscow have both sought to bring the eu in as an arbitrator in their dispute , but the rushed energy summits was snubbed by western europe , who seemed in angry retreat after a failed bid to broker renewed gas transits one week ago . it was still unclear sunday whether tymoshenko had the backing of her political rival ukrainian president viktor yushchenko for the deal she negotiated in moscow . russia embargoed gas supplies to ukraine on jan .
1 when kyiv balked at paying more for gas in 2009 .
russia then halted all supplies of gas to ukraine on jan .
7 amid accusations that kyiv was stealing gas destined for european customers further downstream . the two sides made no mention of the more than $ 600 million that russia claims ukraine still owes for 2008 supplies . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

israel meanwhile hinted it was ready for a swift withdrawal . the summit leaders stressed the importance of lifting the blockade of gaza so that humanitarian aid can enter , ending weapons smuggling , and of creating a unified palestinian state for the sake of transforming sunday morning 's ceasefire into a lasting peace . " we are witnessing today the beginning of the end of this crisis , " egyptian president hosni mubarak , who hosted the summit alongside french president nicolas sarkozy , told reporters on sunday . " we look forward to the end of this sad page from our history , " the egyptian president said .
" a lasting and a just peace is the only way to achieve the security of the people of this region , and a palestinian state is the only way to achieve this peace . " french president nicolas sarkozy echoed mubarak 's remarks . " this is the beginning of our journey to establish two states : an israeli state , and a palestinian state , " sarkozy said . sarkozy further called for the border crossings into gaza to be opened immediately so that urgent humanitarian aid could reach civilians affected by the conflict , and pledged france 's technical assistance to egypt in stopping weapons smuggling from egypt into gaza . the french president said that france supports israel 's struggle to defend its rights and the security of its citizens , but stressed that israel " must promise to leave gaza if the rocket-fire stops . " merkel : two-state solution " sole " possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel said a two-state solution was the sole option german chancellor angela merkel also offered to provide technical and training assistance to help egypt stop weapons smuggling from the sinai peninsula into gaza , and stressed that " the two-state solution is the sole possibility " for achieving peaceful co-existence between israelis and palestinians . un secretary general ban ki-moon called on hamas to stop firing rockets into israel and called on israel to " exercise maximum restraint " in the coming days and weeks . ban spoke of the importance of reviving the middle east peace process and spoke of the 2006 lebanon war and the 2008 fighting in gaza as the " repetition of the failure of this peace process . " he hailed the ceasefire , but warned that " with the division of the palestinian people , this may only be a stop-gap , there is no guarantee that this will not happen again . " " on the basis of a unified palestinian people , we may be able to see a peace " ban said . ban : i have to take care of gazans he said that as secretary-general of the united nations he had " a sworn responsibility to take care of the humanitarian suffering of the people of gaza , " and that within 10 days a un team would present a preliminary assessment of the humanitarian needs in the territory , to be followed by a fuller report two weeks later . british prime minister gordon brown told reporters , " i can see a clear path to peace , " but said in order for the " fragile ceasefire " between israel and hamas to hold , it must be followed by troop withdrawal , the opening of border crossings , an end to rocket attacks , and by " a secure israel and a secure palestine . " brown pledged uk aid in removing unexploded ordnance , in reconstructing buildings destroyed in the fighting , and in counselling children traumatized by the fighting . czech prime minister and current representative of the rotating european presidency mirek topolanek thanked the international committee of the red cross / red crescent and other humanitarian workers who " worked to alleviate the suffering of gazans , " and extended his country 's " condolences to all those palestinians who lost family members in the fighting . " " a humanitarian catastrophe " palestinian president mahmoud abbas described the crisis in gaza as " a humanitarian catastrophe , " and said that " what you saw in the media is much less than what happened in gaza . " he said meetings to discuss the reconstruction of gaza and the reconciliation of hamas and fatah were important , but that " what was of the utmost urgency was to stop the war . " olmert : no intention to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert expressed deep regret over palestinian casualties representatives of israel and hamas did not attend the summit , but the european leaders headed to jerusalem following their meeting in egypt . israeli premier ehud olmert told them that his country had no intention of keeping its troops in the gaza strip and will leave the salient once it is satisfied that the ceasefire is holding . " we are keen on getting out the gaza strip with the greatest possible speed , once we can guarantee the ceasefire exists and is stable and there is no danger to the security of southern israel , " he said . olmert however told the european leaders that in order for the ceasefire to take hold , hamas had to be prevented " from rebuilding its military capabilities through the massive smuggling into the gaza strip of weapons from iran and syria . " he thanked the leaders present in jerusalem for a letter committing to help stopping arms smuggling , but added that " now we have , together with the united states and egypt , to translate the commitment into action . " deep regrets over casualties the israeli leader said israel was prepared to work with the europeans " to create better conditions for prosperity for the palestinians in the gaza strip . " palestinian medical officials estimate that at least 1,300 people died in the israeli operation .
it is unclear how many of the palestinian fatalities were militants and how many were civilians . olmert on sunday night said that he wanted to express israel 's pain for the casualties among gazans who were n't involved in terrorism .

but issues like afghanistan , the environment and the auto industry are likely to cause friction soon . when barack obama raises his right hand on tuesday and takes the presidential oath , a new era will begin .
his eloquence and charisma alone are bound to bring the new style that many - both in the us and abroad - are hoping for after george w. bush 's term draws to a close . however , the situation is n't simple .
the us is currently facing the worst economic crisis since the 1930s .
its military is involved in two wars .
from the middle east to north korea , foreign policy is difficult at best .
during the presidential race , ambitious domestic projects were promised , like health care reform and a new energy policy . great expectations the man who now has it all on his shoulders is 47 years old , has no experience in government , and has n't even completed a full legislature period in the us senate . nevertheless , expectations are high - particularly from abroad .
germany 's hopes in obama were clearly evident when he visited berlin in july 2008 and a crowd of 200,000 fans gave him a rock star 's welcome at the city 's victory column .
he was visibly moved to see so many in the german capital shouting , " yes we can ! " this euphoria was topped during the election on nov .
4 .
millions of germans joined in the party fever , making for the most exciting election night germany had ever seen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his first priority is the united states one visitor at an election party in germany summed up the feeling : " if he accomplishes only half of the things he 's promised , then that will be a giant step forward for the whole world - and i 'm extremely happy about that ! " even german president horst koehler took a similar position , though he expressed it a bit more calmly . " this is a great opportunity to fill the german-american relationship with more convincing content , " said koehler .
" it 's an opportunity for the united states of america , for germany and for the whole world . " stickling point afghanistan it wo n't be easy for the 44th american president to please the whole world .
after all , not only does he not have any superpowers , he is also responsible first and foremost to his own countrymen , pointed out bonn-based political scientist christian hacke . some of obama 's ideas do n't align with those of the german government as well as many people think .
there are considerable differences of opinion when it comes to the german military 's participation in afghanistan , for example . the future us government has already said it wants more german soldiers in hindu kush , a position not shared by berlin . " obama 's advisors know that in an election year there wo n't be a majority in support of sending german troops to the south and they wo n't even demand it , " said karsten voigt , berlin 's coordinator for german-american relations . it remains to be seen whether obama and his team really will , in fact , be so sensitive .
the white house may be getting a new resident , but many key positions in washington - in the secret service , the military and the banking sector , for example - are n't changing hands . obama 's green soul cooperation on the environment appears somewhat less problematic .
obama did n't hide his ecological leanings during the campaign , which was cause for optimism among germany 's political party the greens . " president obama will , above all , have to create new jobs and to do that he 'll need a sector with gigantic growth potential , " said greens faction leader fritz kuhn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is concerned that a us auto bailout would hurt competition " that is ecological modernization , " he added .
" as far as energy policy goes , the us is so far behind that he can and will be able to create millions of jobs . " car competition warning the labor market is hurting in particular due to jobs lost in the auto industry .
unlike their german competitors , the large us carmakers have depended on heavily polluting gas-guzzlers for far too long . chancellor angela merkel has expressed concern that struggles in the auto branch could lead to tension in german-american relations .
she said she would have some " very serious conversations " with obama , should german carmakers be competitively disadvantaged through us bailout efforts . despite a few bumps along the way , german-american ties have always been harmonious and reconciliatory .
as christian hacke put it , the only real problems will arise if germany starts placing unreasonable expectations on the new president . frank gazon -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

israel meanwhile hinted it was ready for a swift withdrawal . the summit leaders stressed the importance of lifting the blockade of gaza so that humanitarian aid can enter , ending weapons smuggling , and of creating a unified palestinian state for the sake of transforming sunday morning 's ceasefire into a lasting peace . " we are witnessing today the beginning of the end of this crisis , " egyptian president hosni mubarak , who hosted the summit alongside french president nicolas sarkozy , told reporters on sunday . " we look forward to the end of this sad page from our history , " the egyptian president said .
" a lasting and a just peace is the only way to achieve the security of the people of this region , and a palestinian state is the only way to achieve this peace . " french president nicolas sarkozy echoed mubarak 's remarks . " this is the beginning of our journey to establish two states : an israeli state , and a palestinian state , " sarkozy said . sarkozy further called for the border crossings into gaza to be opened immediately so that urgent humanitarian aid could reach civilians affected by the conflict , and pledged france 's technical assistance to egypt in stopping weapons smuggling from egypt into gaza . the french president said that france supports israel 's struggle to defend its rights and the security of its citizens , but stressed that israel " must promise to leave gaza if the rocket-fire stops . " merkel : two-state solution " sole " possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel said a two-state solution was the sole option german chancellor angela merkel also offered to provide technical and training assistance to help egypt stop weapons smuggling from the sinai peninsula into gaza , and stressed that " the two-state solution is the sole possibility " for achieving peaceful co-existence between israelis and palestinians . un secretary general ban ki-moon called on hamas to stop firing rockets into israel and called on israel to " exercise maximum restraint " in the coming days and weeks . ban spoke of the importance of reviving the middle east peace process and spoke of the 2006 lebanon war and the 2008 fighting in gaza as the " repetition of the failure of this peace process . " he hailed the ceasefire , but warned that " with the division of the palestinian people , this may only be a stop-gap , there is no guarantee that this will not happen again . " " on the basis of a unified palestinian people , we may be able to see a peace " ban said . ban : i have to take care of gazans he said that as secretary-general of the united nations he had " a sworn responsibility to take care of the humanitarian suffering of the people of gaza , " and that within 10 days a un team would present a preliminary assessment of the humanitarian needs in the territory , to be followed by a fuller report two weeks later . british prime minister gordon brown told reporters , " i can see a clear path to peace , " but said in order for the " fragile ceasefire " between israel and hamas to hold , it must be followed by troop withdrawal , the opening of border crossings , an end to rocket attacks , and by " a secure israel and a secure palestine . " brown pledged uk aid in removing unexploded ordnance , in reconstructing buildings destroyed in the fighting , and in counselling children traumatized by the fighting . czech prime minister and current representative of the rotating european presidency mirek topolanek thanked the international committee of the red cross / red crescent and other humanitarian workers who " worked to alleviate the suffering of gazans , " and extended his country 's " condolences to all those palestinians who lost family members in the fighting . " " a humanitarian catastrophe " palestinian president mahmoud abbas described the crisis in gaza as " a humanitarian catastrophe , " and said that " what you saw in the media is much less than what happened in gaza . " he said meetings to discuss the reconstruction of gaza and the reconciliation of hamas and fatah were important , but that " what was of the utmost urgency was to stop the war . " olmert : no intention to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert expressed deep regret over palestinian casualties representatives of israel and hamas did not attend the summit , but the european leaders headed to jerusalem following their meeting in egypt . israeli premier ehud olmert told them that his country had no intention of keeping its troops in the gaza strip and will leave the salient once it is satisfied that the ceasefire is holding . " we are keen on getting out the gaza strip with the greatest possible speed , once we can guarantee the ceasefire exists and is stable and there is no danger to the security of southern israel , " he said . olmert however told the european leaders that in order for the ceasefire to take hold , hamas had to be prevented " from rebuilding its military capabilities through the massive smuggling into the gaza strip of weapons from iran and syria . " he thanked the leaders present in jerusalem for a letter committing to help stopping arms smuggling , but added that " now we have , together with the united states and egypt , to translate the commitment into action . " deep regrets over casualties the israeli leader said israel was prepared to work with the europeans " to create better conditions for prosperity for the palestinians in the gaza strip . " palestinian medical officials estimate that at least 1,300 people died in the israeli operation .
it is unclear how many of the palestinian fatalities were militants and how many were civilians . olmert on sunday night said that he wanted to express israel 's pain for the casualties among gazans who were n't involved in terrorism . " i express , in the name of the state of israel and the government of israel and its people , my deep regret for these casualties .

social democrats suffered dramatic losses . the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who govern at national level with the cdu , saw their share of the vote plunge to an historic low of 23.8 percent after narrowly failing to unseat cdu prime minister roland koch in a closely contested election a year ago . the chancellor 's conservative party was unable to profit from the spd 's poor showing and got 37.2 percent of the vote , slightly increasing its share when compared to the 36.8 percent it polled in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's fdp leader joerg-uwe hahn will likely form a government with koch the cdu 's preferred coalition partner , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , was tipped to win around 16.2 percent , giving the two parties a comfortable majority in the 110-member legislature in wiesbaden . hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the financial center of frankfurt is located , has been administered for the past 10 months by a caretaker government led by koch . sunday 's vote came less than a week after merkel unveiled a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- economic stimulus package designed to cushion the effects of a deepening recession . super election year kick-off the vote kicked off a super election year , which sees five of the country 's 16 states go to the polls , as well as elections for a new president in may , european elections in june and a general election on sept .
27 . voter support for the hesse spd had steadily eroded since a botched attempt to unseat koch and form a minority government with help from the greens and radical left party , which has its roots among former east german communists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's spd leader andrea ypsilanti -lrb- right -rrb- will likely be replaced by front-runner thorsten schaefer-guembel -lrb- left -rrb- analysts said voters punished the spd for a decision by its leader andrea ypsilanti to seek the backing of the left party , despite promising in campaign speeches that she would not do so . ypsilanti announced her resignation as party chairman immediately after the first results were announced . the greens won 13.8 percent and the left party 5.3 percent .
around 4.4 million people were eligible to vote in the election . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

social democrats suffered dramatic losses . the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who govern at national level with the cdu , saw their share of the vote plunge to an historic low of 23.8 percent after narrowly failing to unseat cdu prime minister roland koch in a closely contested election a year ago . the chancellor 's conservative party was unable to profit from the spd 's poor showing and got 37.2 percent of the vote , slightly increasing its share when compared to the 36.8 percent it polled in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's fdp leader joerg-uwe hahn will likely form a government with koch the cdu 's preferred coalition partner , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , was tipped to win around 16.2 percent , giving the two parties a comfortable majority in the 110-member legislature in wiesbaden . hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the financial center of frankfurt is located , has been administered for the past 10 months by a caretaker government led by koch . sunday 's vote came less than a week after merkel unveiled a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- economic stimulus package designed to cushion the effects of a deepening recession . super election year kick-off the vote kicked off a super election year , which sees five of the country 's 16 states go to the polls , as well as elections for a new president in may , european elections in june and a general election on sept .
27 . voter support for the hesse spd had steadily eroded since a botched attempt to unseat koch and form a minority government with help from the greens and radical left party , which has its roots among former east german communists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's spd leader andrea ypsilanti -lrb- right -rrb- will likely be replaced by front-runner thorsten schaefer-guembel -lrb- left -rrb- analysts said voters punished the spd for a decision by its leader andrea ypsilanti to seek the backing of the left party , despite promising in campaign speeches that she would not do so . ypsilanti announced her resignation as party chairman immediately after the first results were announced . the greens won 13.8 percent and the left party 5.3 percent .
around 4.4 million people were eligible to vote in the election . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

israel meanwhile hinted it was ready for a swift withdrawal . the summit leaders stressed the importance of lifting the blockade of gaza so that humanitarian aid can enter , ending weapons smuggling , and of creating a unified palestinian state for the sake of transforming sunday morning 's ceasefire into a lasting peace . " we are witnessing today the beginning of the end of this crisis , " egyptian president hosni mubarak , who hosted the summit alongside french president nicolas sarkozy , told reporters on sunday . " we look forward to the end of this sad page from our history , " the egyptian president said .
" a lasting and a just peace is the only way to achieve the security of the people of this region , and a palestinian state is the only way to achieve this peace . " french president nicolas sarkozy echoed mubarak 's remarks . " this is the beginning of our journey to establish two states : an israeli state , and a palestinian state , " sarkozy said . sarkozy further called for the border crossings into gaza to be opened immediately so that urgent humanitarian aid could reach civilians affected by the conflict , and pledged france 's technical assistance to egypt in stopping weapons smuggling from egypt into gaza . the french president said that france supports israel 's struggle to defend its rights and the security of its citizens , but stressed that israel " must promise to leave gaza if the rocket-fire stops . " merkel : two-state solution " sole " possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel said a two-state solution was the sole option german chancellor angela merkel also offered to provide technical and training assistance to help egypt stop weapons smuggling from the sinai peninsula into gaza , and stressed that " the two-state solution is the sole possibility " for achieving peaceful co-existence between israelis and palestinians . un secretary general ban ki-moon called on hamas to stop firing rockets into israel and called on israel to " exercise maximum restraint " in the coming days and weeks . ban spoke of the importance of reviving the middle east peace process and spoke of the 2006 lebanon war and the 2008 fighting in gaza as the " repetition of the failure of this peace process . " he hailed the ceasefire , but warned that " with the division of the palestinian people , this may only be a stop-gap , there is no guarantee that this will not happen again . " " on the basis of a unified palestinian people , we may be able to see a peace " ban said . ban : i have to take care of gazans he said that as secretary-general of the united nations he had " a sworn responsibility to take care of the humanitarian suffering of the people of gaza , " and that within 10 days a un team would present a preliminary assessment of the humanitarian needs in the territory , to be followed by a fuller report two weeks later . british prime minister gordon brown told reporters , " i can see a clear path to peace , " but said in order for the " fragile ceasefire " between israel and hamas to hold , it must be followed by troop withdrawal , the opening of border crossings , an end to rocket attacks , and by " a secure israel and a secure palestine . " brown pledged uk aid in removing unexploded ordnance , in reconstructing buildings destroyed in the fighting , and in counselling children traumatized by the fighting . czech prime minister and current representative of the rotating european presidency mirek topolanek thanked the international committee of the red cross / red crescent and other humanitarian workers who " worked to alleviate the suffering of gazans , " and extended his country 's " condolences to all those palestinians who lost family members in the fighting . " " a humanitarian catastrophe " palestinian president mahmoud abbas described the crisis in gaza as " a humanitarian catastrophe , " and said that " what you saw in the media is much less than what happened in gaza . " he said meetings to discuss the reconstruction of gaza and the reconciliation of hamas and fatah were important , but that " what was of the utmost urgency was to stop the war . " olmert : no intention to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert expressed deep regret over palestinian casualties representatives of israel and hamas did not attend the summit , but the european leaders headed to jerusalem following their meeting in egypt . israeli premier ehud olmert told them that his country had no intention of keeping its troops in the gaza strip and will leave the salient once it is satisfied that the ceasefire is holding . " we are keen on getting out the gaza strip with the greatest possible speed , once we can guarantee the ceasefire exists and is stable and there is no danger to the security of southern israel , " he said . olmert however told the european leaders that in order for the ceasefire to take hold , hamas had to be prevented " from rebuilding its military capabilities through the massive smuggling into the gaza strip of weapons from iran and syria . " he thanked the leaders present in jerusalem for a letter committing to help stopping arms smuggling , but added that " now we have , together with the united states and egypt , to translate the commitment into action . " deep regrets over casualties the israeli leader said israel was prepared to work with the europeans " to create better conditions for prosperity for the palestinians in the gaza strip . " palestinian medical officials estimate that at least 1,300 people died in the israeli operation .
it is unclear how many of the palestinian fatalities were militants and how many were civilians . olmert on sunday night said that he wanted to express israel 's pain for the casualties among gazans who were n't involved in terrorism . " i express , in the name of the state of israel and the government of israel and its people , my deep regret for these casualties .

its military is involved in two wars .
from the middle east to north korea , foreign policy is difficult at best .
during the presidential race , ambitious domestic projects were promised , like health care reform and a new energy policy . great expectations the man who now has it all on his shoulders is 47 years old , has no experience in government , and has n't even completed a full legislature period in the us senate . nevertheless , expectations are high - particularly from abroad .
germany 's hopes in obama were clearly evident when he visited berlin in july 2008 and a crowd of 200,000 fans gave him a rock star 's welcome at the city 's victory column .
he was visibly moved to see so many in the german capital shouting , " yes we can ! " this euphoria was topped during the election on nov .
4 .
millions of germans joined in the party fever , making for the most exciting election night germany had ever seen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his first priority is the united states one visitor at an election party in germany summed up the feeling : " if he accomplishes only half of the things he 's promised , then that will be a giant step forward for the whole world - and i 'm extremely happy about that ! " even german president horst koehler took a similar position , though he expressed it a bit more calmly . " this is a great opportunity to fill the german-american relationship with more convincing content , " said koehler .
" it 's an opportunity for the united states of america , for germany and for the whole world . " stickling point afghanistan it wo n't be easy for the 44th american president to please the whole world .
after all , not only does he not have any superpowers , he is also responsible first and foremost to his own countrymen , pointed out bonn-based political scientist christian hacke . some of obama 's ideas do n't align with those of the german government as well as many people think .
there are considerable differences of opinion when it comes to the german military 's participation in afghanistan , for example . the future us government has already said it wants more german soldiers in hindu kush , a position not shared by berlin . " obama 's advisors know that in an election year there wo n't be a majority in support of sending german troops to the south and they wo n't even demand it , " said karsten voigt , berlin 's coordinator for german-american relations . it remains to be seen whether obama and his team really will , in fact , be so sensitive .
the white house may be getting a new resident , but many key positions in washington - in the secret service , the military and the banking sector , for example - are n't changing hands . obama 's green soul cooperation on the environment appears somewhat less problematic .
obama did n't hide his ecological leanings during the campaign , which was cause for optimism among germany 's political party the greens . " president obama will , above all , have to create new jobs and to do that he 'll need a sector with gigantic growth potential , " said greens faction leader fritz kuhn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is concerned that a us auto bailout would hurt competition " that is ecological modernization , " he added .
" as far as energy policy goes , the us is so far behind that he can and will be able to create millions of jobs . " car competition warning the labor market is hurting in particular due to jobs lost in the auto industry .
unlike their german competitors , the large us carmakers have depended on heavily polluting gas-guzzlers for far too long . chancellor angela merkel has expressed concern that struggles in the auto branch could lead to tension in german-american relations .
she said she would have some " very serious conversations " with obama , should german carmakers be competitively disadvantaged through us bailout efforts . despite a few bumps along the way , german-american ties have always been harmonious and reconciliatory .
as christian hacke put it , the only real problems will arise if germany starts placing unreasonable expectations on the new president . frank gazon -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

israel meanwhile hinted it was ready for a swift withdrawal . the summit leaders stressed the importance of lifting the blockade of gaza so that humanitarian aid can enter , ending weapons smuggling , and of creating a unified palestinian state for the sake of transforming sunday morning 's ceasefire into a lasting peace .

social democrats suffered dramatic losses . the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who govern at national level with the cdu , saw their share of the vote plunge to an historic low of 23.8 percent after narrowly failing to unseat cdu prime minister roland koch in a closely contested election a year ago . the chancellor 's conservative party was unable to profit from the spd 's poor showing and got 37.2 percent of the vote , slightly increasing its share when compared to the 36.8 percent it polled in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's fdp leader joerg-uwe hahn will likely form a government with koch the cdu 's preferred coalition partner , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , was tipped to win around 16.2 percent , giving the two parties a comfortable majority in the 110-member legislature in wiesbaden . hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the financial center of frankfurt is located , has been administered for the past 10 months by a caretaker government led by koch . sunday 's vote came less than a week after merkel unveiled a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- economic stimulus package designed to cushion the effects of a deepening recession . super election year kick-off the vote kicked off a super election year , which sees five of the country 's 16 states go to the polls , as well as elections for a new president in may , european elections in june and a general election on sept .
27 . voter support for the hesse spd had steadily eroded since a botched attempt to unseat koch and form a minority government with help from the greens and radical left party , which has its roots among former east german communists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's spd leader andrea ypsilanti -lrb- right -rrb- will likely be replaced by front-runner thorsten schaefer-guembel -lrb- left -rrb- analysts said voters punished the spd for a decision by its leader andrea ypsilanti to seek the backing of the left party , despite promising in campaign speeches that she would not do so . ypsilanti announced her resignation as party chairman immediately after the first results were announced . the greens won 13.8 percent and the left party 5.3 percent .

but issues like afghanistan , the environment and the auto industry are likely to cause friction soon . when barack obama raises his right hand on tuesday and takes the presidential oath , a new era will begin .
his eloquence and charisma alone are bound to bring the new style that many - both in the us and abroad - are hoping for after george w. bush 's term draws to a close . however , the situation is n't simple .
the us is currently facing the worst economic crisis since the 1930s .
its military is involved in two wars .
from the middle east to north korea , foreign policy is difficult at best .
during the presidential race , ambitious domestic projects were promised , like health care reform and a new energy policy . great expectations the man who now has it all on his shoulders is 47 years old , has no experience in government , and has n't even completed a full legislature period in the us senate . nevertheless , expectations are high - particularly from abroad .
germany 's hopes in obama were clearly evident when he visited berlin in july 2008 and a crowd of 200,000 fans gave him a rock star 's welcome at the city 's victory column .
he was visibly moved to see so many in the german capital shouting , " yes we can ! " this euphoria was topped during the election on nov .
4 .
millions of germans joined in the party fever , making for the most exciting election night germany had ever seen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his first priority is the united states one visitor at an election party in germany summed up the feeling : " if he accomplishes only half of the things he 's promised , then that will be a giant step forward for the whole world - and i 'm extremely happy about that ! " even german president horst koehler took a similar position , though he expressed it a bit more calmly . " this is a great opportunity to fill the german-american relationship with more convincing content , " said koehler .
" it 's an opportunity for the united states of america , for germany and for the whole world . " stickling point afghanistan it wo n't be easy for the 44th american president to please the whole world .
after all , not only does he not have any superpowers , he is also responsible first and foremost to his own countrymen , pointed out bonn-based political scientist christian hacke . some of obama 's ideas do n't align with those of the german government as well as many people think .
there are considerable differences of opinion when it comes to the german military 's participation in afghanistan , for example . the future us government has already said it wants more german soldiers in hindu kush , a position not shared by berlin . " obama 's advisors know that in an election year there wo n't be a majority in support of sending german troops to the south and they wo n't even demand it , " said karsten voigt , berlin 's coordinator for german-american relations . it remains to be seen whether obama and his team really will , in fact , be so sensitive .
the white house may be getting a new resident , but many key positions in washington - in the secret service , the military and the banking sector , for example - are n't changing hands . obama 's green soul cooperation on the environment appears somewhat less problematic .
obama did n't hide his ecological leanings during the campaign , which was cause for optimism among germany 's political party the greens . " president obama will , above all , have to create new jobs and to do that he 'll need a sector with gigantic growth potential , " said greens faction leader fritz kuhn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is concerned that a us auto bailout would hurt competition " that is ecological modernization , " he added .
" as far as energy policy goes , the us is so far behind that he can and will be able to create millions of jobs . " car competition warning the labor market is hurting in particular due to jobs lost in the auto industry .
unlike their german competitors , the large us carmakers have depended on heavily polluting gas-guzzlers for far too long . chancellor angela merkel has expressed concern that struggles in the auto branch could lead to tension in german-american relations .
she said she would have some " very serious conversations " with obama , should german carmakers be competitively disadvantaged through us bailout efforts . despite a few bumps along the way , german-american ties have always been harmonious and reconciliatory .
as christian hacke put it , the only real problems will arise if germany starts placing unreasonable expectations on the new president . frank gazon -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

social democrats suffered dramatic losses . the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who govern at national level with the cdu , saw their share of the vote plunge to an historic low of 23.8 percent after narrowly failing to unseat cdu prime minister roland koch in a closely contested election a year ago . the chancellor 's conservative party was unable to profit from the spd 's poor showing and got 37.2 percent of the vote , slightly increasing its share when compared to the 36.8 percent it polled in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's fdp leader joerg-uwe hahn will likely form a government with koch the cdu 's preferred coalition partner , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , was tipped to win around 16.2 percent , giving the two parties a comfortable majority in the 110-member legislature in wiesbaden . hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the financial center of frankfurt is located , has been administered for the past 10 months by a caretaker government led by koch . sunday 's vote came less than a week after merkel unveiled a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- economic stimulus package designed to cushion the effects of a deepening recession . super election year kick-off the vote kicked off a super election year , which sees five of the country 's 16 states go to the polls , as well as elections for a new president in may , european elections in june and a general election on sept .

israel meanwhile hinted it was ready for a swift withdrawal . the summit leaders stressed the importance of lifting the blockade of gaza so that humanitarian aid can enter , ending weapons smuggling , and of creating a unified palestinian state for the sake of transforming sunday morning 's ceasefire into a lasting peace . " we are witnessing today the beginning of the end of this crisis , " egyptian president hosni mubarak , who hosted the summit alongside french president nicolas sarkozy , told reporters on sunday . " we look forward to the end of this sad page from our history , " the egyptian president said .
" a lasting and a just peace is the only way to achieve the security of the people of this region , and a palestinian state is the only way to achieve this peace . " french president nicolas sarkozy echoed mubarak 's remarks . " this is the beginning of our journey to establish two states : an israeli state , and a palestinian state , " sarkozy said . sarkozy further called for the border crossings into gaza to be opened immediately so that urgent humanitarian aid could reach civilians affected by the conflict , and pledged france 's technical assistance to egypt in stopping weapons smuggling from egypt into gaza . the french president said that france supports israel 's struggle to defend its rights and the security of its citizens , but stressed that israel " must promise to leave gaza if the rocket-fire stops . " merkel : two-state solution " sole " possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel said a two-state solution was the sole option german chancellor angela merkel also offered to provide technical and training assistance to help egypt stop weapons smuggling from the sinai peninsula into gaza , and stressed that " the two-state solution is the sole possibility " for achieving peaceful co-existence between israelis and palestinians . un secretary general ban ki-moon called on hamas to stop firing rockets into israel and called on israel to " exercise maximum restraint " in the coming days and weeks . ban spoke of the importance of reviving the middle east peace process and spoke of the 2006 lebanon war and the 2008 fighting in gaza as the " repetition of the failure of this peace process . " he hailed the ceasefire , but warned that " with the division of the palestinian people , this may only be a stop-gap , there is no guarantee that this will not happen again . " " on the basis of a unified palestinian people , we may be able to see a peace " ban said . ban : i have to take care of gazans he said that as secretary-general of the united nations he had " a sworn responsibility to take care of the humanitarian suffering of the people of gaza , " and that within 10 days a un team would present a preliminary assessment of the humanitarian needs in the territory , to be followed by a fuller report two weeks later . british prime minister gordon brown told reporters , " i can see a clear path to peace , " but said in order for the " fragile ceasefire " between israel and hamas to hold , it must be followed by troop withdrawal , the opening of border crossings , an end to rocket attacks , and by " a secure israel and a secure palestine . " brown pledged uk aid in removing unexploded ordnance , in reconstructing buildings destroyed in the fighting , and in counselling children traumatized by the fighting . czech prime minister and current representative of the rotating european presidency mirek topolanek thanked the international committee of the red cross / red crescent and other humanitarian workers who " worked to alleviate the suffering of gazans , " and extended his country 's " condolences to all those palestinians who lost family members in the fighting . " " a humanitarian catastrophe " palestinian president mahmoud abbas described the crisis in gaza as " a humanitarian catastrophe , " and said that " what you saw in the media is much less than what happened in gaza . " he said meetings to discuss the reconstruction of gaza and the reconciliation of hamas and fatah were important , but that " what was of the utmost urgency was to stop the war . " olmert : no intention to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert expressed deep regret over palestinian casualties representatives of israel and hamas did not attend the summit , but the european leaders headed to jerusalem following their meeting in egypt . israeli premier ehud olmert told them that his country had no intention of keeping its troops in the gaza strip and will leave the salient once it is satisfied that the ceasefire is holding . " we are keen on getting out the gaza strip with the greatest possible speed , once we can guarantee the ceasefire exists and is stable and there is no danger to the security of southern israel , " he said . olmert however told the european leaders that in order for the ceasefire to take hold , hamas had to be prevented " from rebuilding its military capabilities through the massive smuggling into the gaza strip of weapons from iran and syria . " he thanked the leaders present in jerusalem for a letter committing to help stopping arms smuggling , but added that " now we have , together with the united states and egypt , to translate the commitment into action . " deep regrets over casualties the israeli leader said israel was prepared to work with the europeans " to create better conditions for prosperity for the palestinians in the gaza strip . " palestinian medical officials estimate that at least 1,300 people died in the israeli operation .
it is unclear how many of the palestinian fatalities were militants and how many were civilians . olmert on sunday night said that he wanted to express israel 's pain for the casualties among gazans who were n't involved in terrorism . " i express , in the name of the state of israel and the government of israel and its people , my deep regret for these casualties .

israel meanwhile hinted it was ready for a swift withdrawal . the summit leaders stressed the importance of lifting the blockade of gaza so that humanitarian aid can enter , ending weapons smuggling , and of creating a unified palestinian state for the sake of transforming sunday morning 's ceasefire into a lasting peace . " we are witnessing today the beginning of the end of this crisis , " egyptian president hosni mubarak , who hosted the summit alongside french president nicolas sarkozy , told reporters on sunday . " we look forward to the end of this sad page from our history , " the egyptian president said .
" a lasting and a just peace is the only way to achieve the security of the people of this region , and a palestinian state is the only way to achieve this peace . " french president nicolas sarkozy echoed mubarak 's remarks . " this is the beginning of our journey to establish two states : an israeli state , and a palestinian state , " sarkozy said . sarkozy further called for the border crossings into gaza to be opened immediately so that urgent humanitarian aid could reach civilians affected by the conflict , and pledged france 's technical assistance to egypt in stopping weapons smuggling from egypt into gaza . the french president said that france supports israel 's struggle to defend its rights and the security of its citizens , but stressed that israel " must promise to leave gaza if the rocket-fire stops . " merkel : two-state solution " sole " possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel said a two-state solution was the sole option german chancellor angela merkel also offered to provide technical and training assistance to help egypt stop weapons smuggling from the sinai peninsula into gaza , and stressed that " the two-state solution is the sole possibility " for achieving peaceful co-existence between israelis and palestinians . un secretary general ban ki-moon called on hamas to stop firing rockets into israel and called on israel to " exercise maximum restraint " in the coming days and weeks . ban spoke of the importance of reviving the middle east peace process and spoke of the 2006 lebanon war and the 2008 fighting in gaza as the " repetition of the failure of this peace process . " he hailed the ceasefire , but warned that " with the division of the palestinian people , this may only be a stop-gap , there is no guarantee that this will not happen again . " " on the basis of a unified palestinian people , we may be able to see a peace " ban said . ban : i have to take care of gazans he said that as secretary-general of the united nations he had " a sworn responsibility to take care of the humanitarian suffering of the people of gaza , " and that within 10 days a un team would present a preliminary assessment of the humanitarian needs in the territory , to be followed by a fuller report two weeks later . british prime minister gordon brown told reporters , " i can see a clear path to peace , " but said in order for the " fragile ceasefire " between israel and hamas to hold , it must be followed by troop withdrawal , the opening of border crossings , an end to rocket attacks , and by " a secure israel and a secure palestine . " brown pledged uk aid in removing unexploded ordnance , in reconstructing buildings destroyed in the fighting , and in counselling children traumatized by the fighting . czech prime minister and current representative of the rotating european presidency mirek topolanek thanked the international committee of the red cross / red crescent and other humanitarian workers who " worked to alleviate the suffering of gazans , " and extended his country 's " condolences to all those palestinians who lost family members in the fighting . " " a humanitarian catastrophe " palestinian president mahmoud abbas described the crisis in gaza as " a humanitarian catastrophe , " and said that " what you saw in the media is much less than what happened in gaza . " he said meetings to discuss the reconstruction of gaza and the reconciliation of hamas and fatah were important , but that " what was of the utmost urgency was to stop the war . " olmert : no intention to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert expressed deep regret over palestinian casualties representatives of israel and hamas did not attend the summit , but the european leaders headed to jerusalem following their meeting in egypt . israeli premier ehud olmert told them that his country had no intention of keeping its troops in the gaza strip and will leave the salient once it is satisfied that the ceasefire is holding . " we are keen on getting out the gaza strip with the greatest possible speed , once we can guarantee the ceasefire exists and is stable and there is no danger to the security of southern israel , " he said . olmert however told the european leaders that in order for the ceasefire to take hold , hamas had to be prevented " from rebuilding its military capabilities through the massive smuggling into the gaza strip of weapons from iran and syria . " he thanked the leaders present in jerusalem for a letter committing to help stopping arms smuggling , but added that " now we have , together with the united states and egypt , to translate the commitment into action . " deep regrets over casualties the israeli leader said israel was prepared to work with the europeans " to create better conditions for prosperity for the palestinians in the gaza strip . " palestinian medical officials estimate that at least 1,300 people died in the israeli operation .
it is unclear how many of the palestinian fatalities were militants and how many were civilians . olmert on sunday night said that he wanted to express israel 's pain for the casualties among gazans who were n't involved in terrorism . " i express , in the name of the state of israel and the government of israel and its people , my deep regret for these casualties .

one of their tasks is the issuing of fatwas - religious opinions on islamic law which can serve as behavioral guidelines for muslims in specific situations . for years now , the teachings of imams in germany have been hotly debated . the vast majority -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- are of turkish origin , but there are also imams from morocco and iran .
frequently , imams speak little or no german , nor are they acquainted with the political , social and cultural norms in germany .
many politicians - as well as many muslims living in germany - are now demanding that this situation change . ferid heider grew up in berlin and serves as imam at two of the city 's mosques .
" every muslim can decide for himself who he recognizes as an authority figure , " heider said . as a muslim and an imam , heider is under no obligation to follow the fatwas issued , for example , at the al-azhar university in cairo - one of the most significant educational institutes in the islamic world - or any other scholarly community for that matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is home to a large muslim population his task , he said , is to do the best he can according to knowledge and his conscience .
for him , that means taking the german way of life into account when offering opinions and advice .
a fatwa , he stressed , should always refer to a specific case and set of circumstances . challenges of life in germany heider said he 's often asked by those in his religious community about which behaviors should be permitted or forbidden for muslims .
everyday life in germany is not without conflict for muslims .
prayer times and working hours often do n't mesh , nudity - whether in parks , gyms or the media - is pervasive , and alcohol is freely available . the imam listens to people 's problems , and then refers to the koran and examples from the life of the prophet muhammad .
based on these sources , he then issues an islamic legal opinion . for fatwas issued in europe , heider said it 's important to have " islamic scholars in europe that have either grown up here or have lived here for a long time . "
in his view , only those who are intimately acquainted with the political , social and economic situation of a place can issue adequate fatwas . fatwas issued in germany often vary greatly from those issued in countries with a majority muslim population .
that 's in part due to the nature of a fatwa , says bettina graef , an islamic scholar at berlin 's center for modern oriental studies -lrb- zmo -rrb- .
a fatwa may be a ruling in an individual case , but its significance is often much larger . " everything that 's not forbidden is , in principle , allowed , " said graef .
" and so of course people try to push the boundaries . " fatwas are of central importance to the islamic identity , says graef - an identity that has become particularly important in europe and the us since the 1990s . fatwas imposed from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some aspects of life in germany present dilemmas for muslims many legal scholars in traditional islamic countries view the new islamic practice of law in europe with concern .
they 're worried that their brothers in faith are straying too far from the right path , and may be jeopardizing islam .
in order to prevent this , they issue their own fatwas about how muslims in europe should lead their lives . these fatwas may be issued in far-off countries , but they 're nonetheless a source of concern for law professor and expert on islamic law mathias rohe .
it 's a worrying development , he said , adding that it has its roots in saudi arabia .
imams there have issued opinions demanding that muslims in europe hold themselves apart from what is , in their view , a faithless world . islam is a religion without a highest authority .
there 's no position that is comparable to the catholic pope .
instead , the faithful can choose from a multitude of voices : the imam from the nearest mosque , scholars at al-azhar university , prominent tv sheiks , and superregional fatwa committees .
islamic extremists can just as easily find fatwas to confirm their beliefs as can moderate muslims who believe in peaceful coexistence with members of other religions . islamic organizations representing muslims in germany have also attempted to convince their followers to subscribe to a set of basic principles .
the variety of opinions and degree of individualism hampers muslims ' efforts to successfully represent themselves as a group , said burhan kesici , the secretary general of the islamic council in germany . in his view , having some commonality on fatwas is beneficial to the credibility of islamic spokespeople in germany and europe .
a common islamic organization could very well influence the beliefs of individuals , kesici said .
in addition , it would make it possible to exclude muslims with extremist views . heiner kiesel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

social democrats suffered dramatic losses . the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who govern at national level with the cdu , saw their share of the vote plunge to an historic low of 23.8 percent after narrowly failing to unseat cdu prime minister roland koch in a closely contested election a year ago . the chancellor 's conservative party was unable to profit from the spd 's poor showing and got 37.2 percent of the vote , slightly increasing its share when compared to the 36.8 percent it polled in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's fdp leader joerg-uwe hahn will likely form a government with koch the cdu 's preferred coalition partner , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , was tipped to win around 16.2 percent , giving the two parties a comfortable majority in the 110-member legislature in wiesbaden . hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the financial center of frankfurt is located , has been administered for the past 10 months by a caretaker government led by koch . sunday 's vote came less than a week after merkel unveiled a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- economic stimulus package designed to cushion the effects of a deepening recession . super election year kick-off the vote kicked off a super election year , which sees five of the country 's 16 states go to the polls , as well as elections for a new president in may , european elections in june and a general election on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 18.01.2009 muslims in germany seek clarity on religious law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imams consult the koran and draw on the life of muhammad to issue fatwas imams have a strong influence on muslims living in germany .
one of their tasks is the issuing of fatwas - religious opinions on islamic law which can serve as behavioral guidelines for muslims in specific situations . for years now , the teachings of imams in germany have been hotly debated . the vast majority -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- are of turkish origin , but there are also imams from morocco and iran .
frequently , imams speak little or no german , nor are they acquainted with the political , social and cultural norms in germany .
many politicians - as well as many muslims living in germany - are now demanding that this situation change . ferid heider grew up in berlin and serves as imam at two of the city 's mosques .
" every muslim can decide for himself who he recognizes as an authority figure , " heider said . as a muslim and an imam , heider is under no obligation to follow the fatwas issued , for example , at the al-azhar university in cairo - one of the most significant educational institutes in the islamic world - or any other scholarly community for that matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is home to a large muslim population his task , he said , is to do the best he can according to knowledge and his conscience .
for him , that means taking the german way of life into account when offering opinions and advice .
a fatwa , he stressed , should always refer to a specific case and set of circumstances . challenges of life in germany heider said he 's often asked by those in his religious community about which behaviors should be permitted or forbidden for muslims .
everyday life in germany is not without conflict for muslims .
prayer times and working hours often do n't mesh , nudity - whether in parks , gyms or the media - is pervasive , and alcohol is freely available . the imam listens to people 's problems , and then refers to the koran and examples from the life of the prophet muhammad .
based on these sources , he then issues an islamic legal opinion . for fatwas issued in europe , heider said it 's important to have " islamic scholars in europe that have either grown up here or have lived here for a long time . "
in his view , only those who are intimately acquainted with the political , social and economic situation of a place can issue adequate fatwas . fatwas issued in germany often vary greatly from those issued in countries with a majority muslim population .
that 's in part due to the nature of a fatwa , says bettina graef , an islamic scholar at berlin 's center for modern oriental studies -lrb- zmo -rrb- .
a fatwa may be a ruling in an individual case , but its significance is often much larger . " everything that 's not forbidden is , in principle , allowed , " said graef .
" and so of course people try to push the boundaries . " fatwas are of central importance to the islamic identity , says graef - an identity that has become particularly important in europe and the us since the 1990s . fatwas imposed from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some aspects of life in germany present dilemmas for muslims many legal scholars in traditional islamic countries view the new islamic practice of law in europe with concern .
they 're worried that their brothers in faith are straying too far from the right path , and may be jeopardizing islam .
in order to prevent this , they issue their own fatwas about how muslims in europe should lead their lives . these fatwas may be issued in far-off countries , but they 're nonetheless a source of concern for law professor and expert on islamic law mathias rohe .
it 's a worrying development , he said , adding that it has its roots in saudi arabia .

social democrats suffered dramatic losses . the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who govern at national level with the cdu , saw their share of the vote plunge to an historic low of 23.8 percent after narrowly failing to unseat cdu prime minister roland koch in a closely contested election a year ago . the chancellor 's conservative party was unable to profit from the spd 's poor showing and got 37.2 percent of the vote , slightly increasing its share when compared to the 36.8 percent it polled in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's fdp leader joerg-uwe hahn will likely form a government with koch the cdu 's preferred coalition partner , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , was tipped to win around 16.2 percent , giving the two parties a comfortable majority in the 110-member legislature in wiesbaden . hesse , one of germany 's most prosperous states where the financial center of frankfurt is located , has been administered for the past 10 months by a caretaker government led by koch . sunday 's vote came less than a week after merkel unveiled a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- economic stimulus package designed to cushion the effects of a deepening recession . super election year kick-off the vote kicked off a super election year , which sees five of the country 's 16 states go to the polls , as well as elections for a new president in may , european elections in june and a general election on sept .
27 . voter support for the hesse spd had steadily eroded since a botched attempt to unseat koch and form a minority government with help from the greens and radical left party , which has its roots among former east german communists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's spd leader andrea ypsilanti -lrb- right -rrb- will likely be replaced by front-runner thorsten schaefer-guembel -lrb- left -rrb- analysts said voters punished the spd for a decision by its leader andrea ypsilanti to seek the backing of the left party , despite promising in campaign speeches that she would not do so . ypsilanti announced her resignation as party chairman immediately after the first results were announced . the greens won 13.8 percent and the left party 5.3 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 18.01.2009 muslims in germany seek clarity on religious law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imams consult the koran and draw on the life of muhammad to issue fatwas imams have a strong influence on muslims living in germany .
one of their tasks is the issuing of fatwas - religious opinions on islamic law which can serve as behavioral guidelines for muslims in specific situations . for years now , the teachings of imams in germany have been hotly debated . the vast majority -lrb- 90 percent -rrb- are of turkish origin , but there are also imams from morocco and iran .
frequently , imams speak little or no german , nor are they acquainted with the political , social and cultural norms in germany .
many politicians - as well as many muslims living in germany - are now demanding that this situation change . ferid heider grew up in berlin and serves as imam at two of the city 's mosques .
" every muslim can decide for himself who he recognizes as an authority figure , " heider said . as a muslim and an imam , heider is under no obligation to follow the fatwas issued , for example , at the al-azhar university in cairo - one of the most significant educational institutes in the islamic world - or any other scholarly community for that matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is home to a large muslim population his task , he said , is to do the best he can according to knowledge and his conscience .
for him , that means taking the german way of life into account when offering opinions and advice .
a fatwa , he stressed , should always refer to a specific case and set of circumstances . challenges of life in germany heider said he 's often asked by those in his religious community about which behaviors should be permitted or forbidden for muslims .
everyday life in germany is not without conflict for muslims .
prayer times and working hours often do n't mesh , nudity - whether in parks , gyms or the media - is pervasive , and alcohol is freely available . the imam listens to people 's problems , and then refers to the koran and examples from the life of the prophet muhammad .
based on these sources , he then issues an islamic legal opinion . for fatwas issued in europe , heider said it 's important to have " islamic scholars in europe that have either grown up here or have lived here for a long time . "
in his view , only those who are intimately acquainted with the political , social and economic situation of a place can issue adequate fatwas . fatwas issued in germany often vary greatly from those issued in countries with a majority muslim population .
that 's in part due to the nature of a fatwa , says bettina graef , an islamic scholar at berlin 's center for modern oriental studies -lrb- zmo -rrb- .
a fatwa may be a ruling in an individual case , but its significance is often much larger . " everything that 's not forbidden is , in principle , allowed , " said graef .
" and so of course people try to push the boundaries . " fatwas are of central importance to the islamic identity , says graef - an identity that has become particularly important in europe and the us since the 1990s . fatwas imposed from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some aspects of life in germany present dilemmas for muslims many legal scholars in traditional islamic countries view the new islamic practice of law in europe with concern .
they 're worried that their brothers in faith are straying too far from the right path , and may be jeopardizing islam .
in order to prevent this , they issue their own fatwas about how muslims in europe should lead their lives . these fatwas may be issued in far-off countries , but they 're nonetheless a source of concern for law professor and expert on islamic law mathias rohe .
it 's a worrying development , he said , adding that it has its roots in saudi arabia .
imams there have issued opinions demanding that muslims in europe hold themselves apart from what is , in their view , a faithless world . islam is a religion without a highest authority .
there 's no position that is comparable to the catholic pope .
instead , the faithful can choose from a multitude of voices : the imam from the nearest mosque , scholars at al-azhar university , prominent tv sheiks , and superregional fatwa committees .
islamic extremists can just as easily find fatwas to confirm their beliefs as can moderate muslims who believe in peaceful coexistence with members of other religions . islamic organizations representing muslims in germany have also attempted to convince their followers to subscribe to a set of basic principles .
the variety of opinions and degree of individualism hampers muslims ' efforts to successfully represent themselves as a group , said burhan kesici , the secretary general of the islamic council in germany . in his view , having some commonality on fatwas is beneficial to the credibility of islamic spokespeople in germany and europe .
a common islamic organization could very well influence the beliefs of individuals , kesici said .
in addition , it would make it possible to exclude muslims with extremist views . heiner kiesel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , to end the gas crisis , which has blocked shipments of russian gas to ukraine and much of western europe since the beginning of the year . in a statement issued sunday , the european commission welcomed the agreement , but said it remained to be seen whether gas would actually arrive in europe in the coming days . experts have said it could take up to three days for gas supplies to reach europe and for pressure to return to normal in pipelines after the taps are opened .
for some countries which have nearly run out of reserve supplies , this could continue to create short-term problems . under the agreement , ukraine would be offered a 20-percent discount on the market price for russian gas deliveries this year , if it agrees to keep transits fees for pumping gas to europe via its pipelines at the 2008 level .
for ukraine , this still means a substantial increase in the first quarter . putin said both countries would switch to european market prices in their gas trade starting in 2010 . eu was getting anxious europe receives a quarter of its gas from russia , 80 percent of which flows through ukrainian pipelines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and timoshenko are ready to ink the deal the european union had called the weekend talks the " last and best chance " for both sides to salvage their reputation as reliable suppliers .
the bloc also threatened to review its relations with both russia and ukraine if the dispute were not resolved this weekend . kyiv and moscow have both sought to bring the eu in as an arbitrator in their dispute , but the rushed energy summits was snubbed by western europe , who seemed in angry retreat after a failed bid to broker renewed gas transits one week ago . it was still unclear sunday whether tymoshenko had the backing of her political rival ukrainian president viktor yushchenko for the deal she negotiated in moscow . russia embargoed gas supplies to ukraine on jan .
1 when kyiv balked at paying more for gas in 2009 .
russia then halted all supplies of gas to ukraine on jan .
7 amid accusations that kyiv was stealing gas destined for european customers further downstream . the two sides made no mention of the more than $ 600 million that russia claims ukraine still owes for 2008 supplies . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all 155 people on board survived the crash and freezing temperatures in the strong current .
an emergency slide was still attached to the wreckage .

investigators hope they will shed light on what happened in the brief minutes between take-off and crash .
the plane 's captain said he made the decision to ditch in the river to avoid a " catastrophic " crash on densely populated land .
birds apparently flew into both engines , disabling them instantly .

woolworths should have been celebrating its centenary this year .
but on 6 january the international retailer , with a presence in nearly every high street , closed down for good .
twenty seven thousand people in the uk are now redundant as a result .
and in one town , three generations of one family lost their job .
that is how the politics show found itself in barrow-in-furness , a town perched at the end of a peninsula in the north-west corner of england .
an isolated town , barrow lies at the southerly tip of the more visited lake district .
some have called it britain 's biggest cul-de-sac .
its people are proud of their past .
murals commemorate the town 's importance as a ship-building hub .
it is here , the uk 's strategic national defences are built , where warships are still commissioned .
bae systems , formerly vickers , is housed in a bulky building by the coastline .
despite its appearance , residents remain fond of it .
it is after all , a major employer .
it is ironic that their local mp is also the defence secretary and has had to sanction the delay in building a new aircraft carrier at the works .
" he used to be for us not against us , " said one constituent .
difficult times but the town is facing a very different difficulty .
the politics show found a family , covering three generations who have had their once-secure futures left as exposed as the peninsula town itself .
there are no sea-faring songs in this industry , although a week ago you might have witnessed a couple of congas by the pic-n-mix .
margaret bewley had worked in the same woolworths for 45 years .
margaret has been awarded the minimum statutory redundancy , capped regardless of how long you have worked there .
loyalty and dedication have ended in a rapid and upsetting sell-off of everything : not just stock but the shelving and baskets she stacked every day of her working life .
at 66 , she could retire .
but like any grandmother , there is a large family she likes to treat .
another generation … stephen , margaret 's son-in-law , rose to assistant manager of the same store .
he supports a family of five and while we were in contact with him , he became a youthful grandfather for the first time .
baby lunar was born the day after his shop closed .
meeting their mortgage payments is a big worry .
and then there is student matt - margaret 's grandson .
he worked there in his spare time , largely for pocket money .
it helped keep his debt down .
his goal was to enter business and management and was working towards it in his degree .
perhaps ironically , we interrupted him writing an essay on future employability .
one possible ambition was to work his way up through woolworths , perhaps managing where he used to buy toys .
a recalibration - as well as a new funding source - is now needed .
barrow survived when other ship-building towns looked for new ways to regenerate .
portland walk was a regeneration of sorts , ushering in a flotilla of new shops .
but in the high street stands an empty shop which had survived the great depression , two world wars and many other busts .
in 2008 , it failed to weather the credit crunch .

vladimir putin and yulia tymoshenko reached the agreement after a day of delicate talks in moscow .
under the deal , ukraine will start paying for russian gas at the much-higher european prices from next year .
the dispute between moscow and kiev has disrupted gas supplies to much of europe for almost two weeks .
see map of affected area " in the very near future , transit - and the ukrainian side has assured us to this effect - will resume , " said mr putin , speaking alongside his ukrainian counterpart on russian tv .
mrs tymoshenko said that the two countries ' energy companies , gazprom and naftohaz , had been instructed to draw up the relevant contracts by monday .
mrs tymoshenko said : " immediately after all the documents on the transit and purchase of gas are signed , all the routes for gas transit and gas supplies to europe will be restored .
" i believe today has been a fruitful day .
mutual understanding has been found . "
eu pressure the parties were under pressure from brussels to reach a deal this weekend .
european commission spokesman johannes laitenberger had said the moscow talks offered " the last and best chance for russia and ukraine to demonstrate they are serious about resolving this dispute " .
" the gas must flow , " he added .
" we will regard this period as a test case for judging whether or not they are credible partners . "
eu states import a quarter of their gas from russia and 80 % of supplies come via ukraine .
almost 20 countries in europe have been affected by the dispute .
russia switched off the gas this month , accusing ukraine firstly of failing to pay for its own supply , then later of stealing gas meant for other countries .
some central and east european states have been reduced to rationing gas , while others have been seeking alternatives to the ukrainian pipelines .
the gas dispute created the eu 's worst ever energy crisis , the bbc 's richard galpin reports from moscow .
ukrainian divisions at his news conference with mrs tymoshenko , mr putin said that discounts for both russian gas supplied to ukraine and the transit rate charged by kiev would apply for the current year .
" we agreed that in 2009 our ukrainian partners will have a discount of 20 % on condition that the preferential tariff for piping russian gas to european consumers through ukraine in 2009 remains in force and that the price for piping will be the price of 2008 , " he said .
" we also agreed that from 1 january 2010 we will entirely move to price and tariff formation fully in accordance with european standards without any exemptions or discounts as regards both the transit and the price of gas . "
european-level prices for gas supplies will mean , at current rates , a jump from $ 179.5 per 1,000 cubic metres to $ 380 for ukraine , according to the kremlin .
on the eve of the talks , sharp divisions emerged between ukraine 's president and prime minister , political foes in a fragile coalition government .
mr yushchenko 's office insisted the moscow talks must combine gas supplies to ukraine with transit supplies to europe in " a single package " .
mrs tymoshenko for her part said : " the ukrainian government does not link the issue of concluding an agreement on -lsb- russian -rsb- gas supplies to ukraine with the issue of resuming gas transit to europe . "
there was no immediate reaction to saturday night 's deal from mr yushchenko .
russian president dmitry medvedev hosted an emergency gas summit in moscow on saturday but eu leaders heeded a call by the czech republic , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , to stay away in order for brussels to speak with one voice at the meeting .
