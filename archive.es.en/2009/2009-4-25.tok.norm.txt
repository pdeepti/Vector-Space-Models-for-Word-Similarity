" the plight of the civilians still trapped by the fighting and who remain at extreme risk from the ongoing hostilities is our primary concern , " the eu presidency said in a statement .
" the eu strongly condemns the killings of civilians and calls on all parties to take all necessary action to avoid further civilian casualties .
" the eu condemns in the strongest possible terms the ltte -lrb- liberation tigers of tamil eelam -rrb- for the use of civilians as human shields .
" both the government of sri lanka and the ltte must fully comply with international humanitarian law and ensure the protection of civilians at all times . "
the united nations has estimated that up to 50,000 civilians are caught in the conflict area while the sri lankan government says it is closer 15,000-20,000 .
the tigers insist the real figure is 165,000 .
the eu backed the un secretary general 's decision to send humanitarian chief john holmes to the temporary ceasefire zone saturday , and called on colombo to allow it unhindered access .
the un estimates that as many as 6,500 civilians may have been killed and another 14,000 wounded in the fighting this year , diplomats said .
independent verification of casualty figures is almost impossible as journalists have long been barred from the island 's north , except when under strict supervision on trips organized by the military .
un humanitarian chief visits war-torn island holmes was due in sri lanka saturday to start a three-day mission which will focus on pushing the government to facilitate humanitarian missions in and around the conflict zone and to allow proper access to tens of thousands of displaced civilians , the un said .
bildunterschrift : sri lankan troops freed thousands of captives after a battle with tamil tigers earlier this week the plight and suffering of those caught in the fighting between government troops and tamil tiger rebels prompted us president barack obama 's administration on friday to urge an end to hostilities .
" we call on both sides to stop fighting immediately and allow civilians to safely leave the combat zone , " the white house said in a statement .
the sri lankan government has so far resisted all calls to halt an offensive that is now on the brink of wiping out the ltte , who have been fighting for an independent tamil homeland since 1972 .
the tigers , once one of the most feared guerrilla organizations in the world , have seen their territory shrink to a sliver of land on the northeast coast estimated to measure 10 square kilometers -lrb- about four square miles -rrb- .
the white house specifically demanded an end to any military shelling in a designated " safe zone " and access for aid groups and journalists to civilians who have escaped .
the ltte issued their own call for foreign intervention , warning of " imminent " starvation among civilians and even suggesting that the situation could deteriorate into a crisis as appalling as that in the darfur region of sudan .
white house warns of a future of repercussions the white house statement warned that the government risked sowing the seeds of future ethnic conflict on the sinhalese-majority island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final push to end the tigers resistance has proved particularly bloody " it would compound the current tragedy if the military end of the conflict only breeds further enmity and ends hopes for reconciliation and a unified sri lanka in the future , " the white house said .
around 110,000 civilians managed to get out of the battle zone earlier in the week , overwhelming the government authorities handling relief operations .
the sri lankan government has been blocking most aid agencies from the war-torn north for months , and accuses un agencies and ngos of supporting the tamil tigers .
the un security council president , mexican ambassador claude heller , said the sri lankan government should allow the un and red cross to access all sites where displaced people were being registered and provided with shelter , according to un spokeswoman marie okabe .
despite this , sri lanka 's human rights minister mahinda samarasinghe welcomed the visit by holmes , his second in as many months .
" we hope to have a constructive discussion with him , " samarasinghe said .

the tigers , once one of the most feared guerrilla organizations in the world , have seen their territory shrink to a sliver of land on the northeast coast estimated to measure 10 square kilometers -lrb- about four square miles -rrb- .
the white house specifically demanded an end to any military shelling in a designated " safe zone " and access for aid groups and journalists to civilians who have escaped .
the ltte issued their own call for foreign intervention , warning of " imminent " starvation among civilians and even suggesting that the situation could deteriorate into a crisis as appalling as that in the darfur region of sudan .

what ’ s the place of religion in the classroom ?
in berlin a referendum will on sunday ask that very question .
currently , the subject of ethics is obligatory and courses in different religious faiths are optional . unlike in most of germany , pupils in the capital berlin do not attend mandatory religion classes . the pupils can however if they decide to opt for extra-curricular lessons in their religious confession .
ethics , on the other hand , is a core subject . the city is divided over the issue .
faith groups say that religion is being marginalized in berlin , while supporters of ethics courses say it is essential for an international town like berlin , where different faiths , ethnicities and other groups live side by side , to have a general subject on morals , ethics and values . the initiative " pro-religion " has been campaigning that students should be able to choose between either ethics or religion . fundamental issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam courses are an option along with catholic or protestant ones volker ladenthin , professor of education at bonn university , is in favor of leaving the system the way it is , arguing that ethics is too much of a fundamental issue to be optional . " students are facing highly complex problems in our society , " he said .
" for that they need to know how to approach such problems , how to deal with them , how to make decisions based on values . " he adds that ethics courses are needed to familiarize students with the values that a society is based on , to make them think about and - it is hoped - adopt those values . the ethics course is not limited to one religious confession , and its supporters say that in a multi-cultural and multi-religious society that 's a crucial advantage .
the subject became part of the capital 's core curriculum in 2006 in the wake of a so-called honor killing within berlin 's turkish community , which raised questions about faith and moral values being taught to the younger generation . religion goes further religion as a subject is confession-based , with students segregated according to faith .
father hans langendörfer of the german bishops conference argues that religion as a subject not only covers the ground of ethics but goes much further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's controversy as to whether ethics courses are the better way to instill morals and values " teaching religion is of course not identical with teaching ethics , " he said .
" religion asks questions about god , about meaning , sense and perspective in our lives .
of course that includes many ethical issues but it 's more than simply teaching the values of our society . " the crucial difference he adds is that in ethics , students simply debate what could be done in a given situation or problem .
but religion tells the students what they should do . " the subject of religion gives you an orientation in life , " he says .
" of course that 's linked to ethical values but it actually urges you to fulfill these . " but others insist that ethics is a fundamental issue that only can be complemented but not replaced by religion .
there are no calls that religion as such should vanish from the curriculum – but simply that it should not become mandatory again . professor ladenthin is convinced that ethics is a subject just as important as any of the other traditional core subjects . " it has to be mandatory – just as physics for instance is mandatory , " he says .
" we can not walk on the ceiling or on the wall – even if we may want to .
physical laws tell us that it 's simply impossible .
and in the very same manner , ethical laws tell us what 's morally wrong and what 's right . " yet for many parents in germany , ethics is the only option anyway .

what ’ s the place of religion in the classroom ?
in berlin a referendum will on sunday ask that very question .
currently , the subject of ethics is obligatory and courses in different religious faiths are optional . unlike in most of germany , pupils in the capital berlin do not attend mandatory religion classes . the pupils can however if they decide to opt for extra-curricular lessons in their religious confession .
ethics , on the other hand , is a core subject . the city is divided over the issue .
faith groups say that religion is being marginalized in berlin , while supporters of ethics courses say it is essential for an international town like berlin , where different faiths , ethnicities and other groups live side by side , to have a general subject on morals , ethics and values . the initiative " pro-religion " has been campaigning that students should be able to choose between either ethics or religion . fundamental issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam courses are an option along with catholic or protestant ones volker ladenthin , professor of education at bonn university , is in favor of leaving the system the way it is , arguing that ethics is too much of a fundamental issue to be optional . " students are facing highly complex problems in our society , " he said .
" for that they need to know how to approach such problems , how to deal with them , how to make decisions based on values . " he adds that ethics courses are needed to familiarize students with the values that a society is based on , to make them think about and - it is hoped - adopt those values . the ethics course is not limited to one religious confession , and its supporters say that in a multi-cultural and multi-religious society that 's a crucial advantage .
the subject became part of the capital 's core curriculum in 2006 in the wake of a so-called honor killing within berlin 's turkish community , which raised questions about faith and moral values being taught to the younger generation . religion goes further religion as a subject is confession-based , with students segregated according to faith .
father hans langendörfer of the german bishops conference argues that religion as a subject not only covers the ground of ethics but goes much further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's controversy as to whether ethics courses are the better way to instill morals and values " teaching religion is of course not identical with teaching ethics , " he said .
" religion asks questions about god , about meaning , sense and perspective in our lives .
of course that includes many ethical issues but it 's more than simply teaching the values of our society . " the crucial difference he adds is that in ethics , students simply debate what could be done in a given situation or problem .
but religion tells the students what they should do . " the subject of religion gives you an orientation in life , " he says .
" of course that 's linked to ethical values but it actually urges you to fulfill these . " but others insist that ethics is a fundamental issue that only can be complemented but not replaced by religion .
there are no calls that religion as such should vanish from the curriculum – but simply that it should not become mandatory again . professor ladenthin is convinced that ethics is a subject just as important as any of the other traditional core subjects . " it has to be mandatory – just as physics for instance is mandatory , " he says .
" we can not walk on the ceiling or on the wall – even if we may want to .
physical laws tell us that it 's simply impossible .
and in the very same manner , ethical laws tell us what 's morally wrong and what 's right . " yet for many parents in germany , ethics is the only option anyway .

" the plight of the civilians still trapped by the fighting and who remain at extreme risk from the ongoing hostilities is our primary concern , " the eu presidency said in a statement .
" the eu strongly condemns the killings of civilians and calls on all parties to take all necessary action to avoid further civilian casualties .
" the eu condemns in the strongest possible terms the ltte -lrb- liberation tigers of tamil eelam -rrb- for the use of civilians as human shields .
" both the government of sri lanka and the ltte must fully comply with international humanitarian law and ensure the protection of civilians at all times . "
the united nations has estimated that up to 50,000 civilians are caught in the conflict area while the sri lankan government says it is closer 15,000-20,000 .
the tigers insist the real figure is 165,000 .
the eu backed the un secretary general 's decision to send humanitarian chief john holmes to the temporary ceasefire zone saturday , and called on colombo to allow it unhindered access .
the un estimates that as many as 6,500 civilians may have been killed and another 14,000 wounded in the fighting this year , diplomats said .
independent verification of casualty figures is almost impossible as journalists have long been barred from the island 's north , except when under strict supervision on trips organized by the military .
un humanitarian chief visits war-torn island holmes was due in sri lanka saturday to start a three-day mission which will focus on pushing the government to facilitate humanitarian missions in and around the conflict zone and to allow proper access to tens of thousands of displaced civilians , the un said .
bildunterschrift : sri lankan troops freed thousands of captives after a battle with tamil tigers earlier this week the plight and suffering of those caught in the fighting between government troops and tamil tiger rebels prompted us president barack obama 's administration on friday to urge an end to hostilities .
" we call on both sides to stop fighting immediately and allow civilians to safely leave the combat zone , " the white house said in a statement .
the sri lankan government has so far resisted all calls to halt an offensive that is now on the brink of wiping out the ltte , who have been fighting for an independent tamil homeland since 1972 .
the tigers , once one of the most feared guerrilla organizations in the world , have seen their territory shrink to a sliver of land on the northeast coast estimated to measure 10 square kilometers -lrb- about four square miles -rrb- .
the white house specifically demanded an end to any military shelling in a designated " safe zone " and access for aid groups and journalists to civilians who have escaped .

the companies stand accused for aiding pyongyang 's missile and nuclear programmes .

north korea claims it put a satellite into orbit in what was widely regarded as a disguised long-range missile test .
the un security council regarded the launch as a breach of a un resolution and threatens sanctions .

the north had been disabling parts of its yongbyon nuclear complex as agreed under a february 2007 six-nation deal involving south korea , the us , china , russia and japan .
experts say it could take the country , which conducted its only nuclear test in october 2006 , as little as three months to have the reprocessing facility up and running again . ai / nda , dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what ’ s the place of religion in the classroom ?
in berlin a referendum will on sunday ask that very question .
currently , the subject of ethics is obligatory and courses in different religious faiths are optional . unlike in most of germany , pupils in the capital berlin do not attend mandatory religion classes . the pupils can however if they decide to opt for extra-curricular lessons in their religious confession .
ethics , on the other hand , is a core subject . the city is divided over the issue .
faith groups say that religion is being marginalized in berlin , while supporters of ethics courses say it is essential for an international town like berlin , where different faiths , ethnicities and other groups live side by side , to have a general subject on morals , ethics and values . the initiative " pro-religion " has been campaigning that students should be able to choose between either ethics or religion . fundamental issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam courses are an option along with catholic or protestant ones volker ladenthin , professor of education at bonn university , is in favor of leaving the system the way it is , arguing that ethics is too much of a fundamental issue to be optional . " students are facing highly complex problems in our society , " he said .
" for that they need to know how to approach such problems , how to deal with them , how to make decisions based on values . " he adds that ethics courses are needed to familiarize students with the values that a society is based on , to make them think about and - it is hoped - adopt those values . the ethics course is not limited to one religious confession , and its supporters say that in a multi-cultural and multi-religious society that 's a crucial advantage .
the subject became part of the capital 's core curriculum in 2006 in the wake of a so-called honor killing within berlin 's turkish community , which raised questions about faith and moral values being taught to the younger generation . religion goes further religion as a subject is confession-based , with students segregated according to faith .
father hans langendörfer of the german bishops conference argues that religion as a subject not only covers the ground of ethics but goes much further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's controversy as to whether ethics courses are the better way to instill morals and values " teaching religion is of course not identical with teaching ethics , " he said .
" religion asks questions about god , about meaning , sense and perspective in our lives .
of course that includes many ethical issues but it 's more than simply teaching the values of our society . " the crucial difference he adds is that in ethics , students simply debate what could be done in a given situation or problem .
but religion tells the students what they should do . " the subject of religion gives you an orientation in life , " he says .
" of course that 's linked to ethical values but it actually urges you to fulfill these . " but others insist that ethics is a fundamental issue that only can be complemented but not replaced by religion .
there are no calls that religion as such should vanish from the curriculum – but simply that it should not become mandatory again . professor ladenthin is convinced that ethics is a subject just as important as any of the other traditional core subjects . " it has to be mandatory – just as physics for instance is mandatory , " he says .
" we can not walk on the ceiling or on the wall – even if we may want to .
physical laws tell us that it 's simply impossible .
and in the very same manner , ethical laws tell us what 's morally wrong and what 's right . " yet for many parents in germany , ethics is the only option anyway .
the country is largely secular .
while two-thirds of germans officially belong to a faith , only a fraction of them actually go to church . author : katrin schilling / andreas illmer editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what ’ s the place of religion in the classroom ?
in berlin a referendum will on sunday ask that very question .
currently , the subject of ethics is obligatory and courses in different religious faiths are optional . unlike in most of germany , pupils in the capital berlin do not attend mandatory religion classes . the pupils can however if they decide to opt for extra-curricular lessons in their religious confession .
ethics , on the other hand , is a core subject . the city is divided over the issue .
faith groups say that religion is being marginalized in berlin , while supporters of ethics courses say it is essential for an international town like berlin , where different faiths , ethnicities and other groups live side by side , to have a general subject on morals , ethics and values . the initiative " pro-religion " has been campaigning that students should be able to choose between either ethics or religion . fundamental issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam courses are an option along with catholic or protestant ones volker ladenthin , professor of education at bonn university , is in favor of leaving the system the way it is , arguing that ethics is too much of a fundamental issue to be optional . " students are facing highly complex problems in our society , " he said .
" for that they need to know how to approach such problems , how to deal with them , how to make decisions based on values . " he adds that ethics courses are needed to familiarize students with the values that a society is based on , to make them think about and - it is hoped - adopt those values . the ethics course is not limited to one religious confession , and its supporters say that in a multi-cultural and multi-religious society that 's a crucial advantage .

" religion asks questions about god , about meaning , sense and perspective in our lives .
of course that includes many ethical issues but it 's more than simply teaching the values of our society . " the crucial difference he adds is that in ethics , students simply debate what could be done in a given situation or problem .
but religion tells the students what they should do . " the subject of religion gives you an orientation in life , " he says .
" of course that 's linked to ethical values but it actually urges you to fulfill these . " but others insist that ethics is a fundamental issue that only can be complemented but not replaced by religion .
there are no calls that religion as such should vanish from the curriculum – but simply that it should not become mandatory again . professor ladenthin is convinced that ethics is a subject just as important as any of the other traditional core subjects .

what ’ s the place of religion in the classroom ?
in berlin a referendum will on sunday ask that very question .
currently , the subject of ethics is obligatory and courses in different religious faiths are optional . unlike in most of germany , pupils in the capital berlin do not attend mandatory religion classes . the pupils can however if they decide to opt for extra-curricular lessons in their religious confession .
ethics , on the other hand , is a core subject . the city is divided over the issue .
faith groups say that religion is being marginalized in berlin , while supporters of ethics courses say it is essential for an international town like berlin , where different faiths , ethnicities and other groups live side by side , to have a general subject on morals , ethics and values . the initiative " pro-religion " has been campaigning that students should be able to choose between either ethics or religion . fundamental issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam courses are an option along with catholic or protestant ones volker ladenthin , professor of education at bonn university , is in favor of leaving the system the way it is , arguing that ethics is too much of a fundamental issue to be optional . " students are facing highly complex problems in our society , " he said .
" for that they need to know how to approach such problems , how to deal with them , how to make decisions based on values . " he adds that ethics courses are needed to familiarize students with the values that a society is based on , to make them think about and - it is hoped - adopt those values . the ethics course is not limited to one religious confession , and its supporters say that in a multi-cultural and multi-religious society that 's a crucial advantage .
the subject became part of the capital 's core curriculum in 2006 in the wake of a so-called honor killing within berlin 's turkish community , which raised questions about faith and moral values being taught to the younger generation . religion goes further religion as a subject is confession-based , with students segregated according to faith .
father hans langendörfer of the german bishops conference argues that religion as a subject not only covers the ground of ethics but goes much further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's controversy as to whether ethics courses are the better way to instill morals and values " teaching religion is of course not identical with teaching ethics , " he said .
" religion asks questions about god , about meaning , sense and perspective in our lives .
of course that includes many ethical issues but it 's more than simply teaching the values of our society . " the crucial difference he adds is that in ethics , students simply debate what could be done in a given situation or problem .
but religion tells the students what they should do . " the subject of religion gives you an orientation in life , " he says .
" of course that 's linked to ethical values but it actually urges you to fulfill these . " but others insist that ethics is a fundamental issue that only can be complemented but not replaced by religion .
there are no calls that religion as such should vanish from the curriculum – but simply that it should not become mandatory again . professor ladenthin is convinced that ethics is a subject just as important as any of the other traditional core subjects . " it has to be mandatory – just as physics for instance is mandatory , " he says .
" we can not walk on the ceiling or on the wall – even if we may want to .
physical laws tell us that it 's simply impossible .
and in the very same manner , ethical laws tell us what 's morally wrong and what 's right . " yet for many parents in germany , ethics is the only option anyway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 25.04.2009 eu , us call for release of civilians as sri lankan stand-off continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of sri lankans have been displaced by the fighting the european union has expressed concern over the fate of tens of thousands of civilians trapped in a sri lanka jungle enclave as rebel fighters vowed to make a last stand . amid reports that the leader of sri lanka 's tamil tiger rebels would hold his ground , the european union 's czech presidency urged government and rebel fighters to protect civilians it fears will be used as human shields .
" the plight of the civilians still trapped by the fighting and who remain at extreme risk from the ongoing hostilities is our primary concern , " the eu presidency said in a statement .
" the eu strongly condemns the killings of civilians and calls on all parties to take all necessary action to avoid further civilian casualties .
" the eu condemns in the strongest possible terms the ltte -lrb- liberation tigers of tamil eelam -rrb- for the use of civilians as human shields .
" both the government of sri lanka and the ltte must fully comply with international humanitarian law and ensure the protection of civilians at all times . "
the united nations has estimated that up to 50,000 civilians are caught in the conflict area while the sri lankan government says it is closer 15,000-20,000 .
the tigers insist the real figure is 165,000 .
the eu backed the un secretary general 's decision to send humanitarian chief john holmes to the temporary ceasefire zone saturday , and called on colombo to allow it unhindered access .
the un estimates that as many as 6,500 civilians may have been killed and another 14,000 wounded in the fighting this year , diplomats said .
independent verification of casualty figures is almost impossible as journalists have long been barred from the island 's north , except when under strict supervision on trips organized by the military .
un humanitarian chief visits war-torn island holmes was due in sri lanka saturday to start a three-day mission which will focus on pushing the government to facilitate humanitarian missions in and around the conflict zone and to allow proper access to tens of thousands of displaced civilians , the un said .
bildunterschrift : sri lankan troops freed thousands of captives after a battle with tamil tigers earlier this week the plight and suffering of those caught in the fighting between government troops and tamil tiger rebels prompted us president barack obama 's administration on friday to urge an end to hostilities .
" we call on both sides to stop fighting immediately and allow civilians to safely leave the combat zone , " the white house said in a statement .
the sri lankan government has so far resisted all calls to halt an offensive that is now on the brink of wiping out the ltte , who have been fighting for an independent tamil homeland since 1972 .
the tigers , once one of the most feared guerrilla organizations in the world , have seen their territory shrink to a sliver of land on the northeast coast estimated to measure 10 square kilometers -lrb- about four square miles -rrb- .
the white house specifically demanded an end to any military shelling in a designated " safe zone " and access for aid groups and journalists to civilians who have escaped .
the ltte issued their own call for foreign intervention , warning of " imminent " starvation among civilians and even suggesting that the situation could deteriorate into a crisis as appalling as that in the darfur region of sudan .
white house warns of a future of repercussions the white house statement warned that the government risked sowing the seeds of future ethnic conflict on the sinhalese-majority island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final push to end the tigers resistance has proved particularly bloody " it would compound the current tragedy if the military end of the conflict only breeds further enmity and ends hopes for reconciliation and a unified sri lanka in the future , " the white house said .
around 110,000 civilians managed to get out of the battle zone earlier in the week , overwhelming the government authorities handling relief operations .
the sri lankan government has been blocking most aid agencies from the war-torn north for months , and accuses un agencies and ngos of supporting the tamil tigers .
the un security council president , mexican ambassador claude heller , said the sri lankan government should allow the un and red cross to access all sites where displaced people were being registered and provided with shelter , according to un spokeswoman marie okabe .
despite this , sri lanka 's human rights minister mahinda samarasinghe welcomed the visit by holmes , his second in as many months .
" we hope to have a constructive discussion with him , " samarasinghe said .

that was the idea behind stuttgart 's new dance company , gauthier dance . canadian eric gauthier has a reputation in the city for unorthodox ways of doing things . many on the scene thought he was crazy to give up a prime post as soloist with the renowned stuttgart ballet and set up his own dance group , especially at a time when financial cuts have meant ballet companies all over the country are watching the last curtain come down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauthier dance does n't just keep to the stage gauthier , however , wanted to break with classical repertoire .

many of them had never been exposed to dance as an art before . while doing a show in a luxemburg hospital , a woman who had n't moved in years suddenly started swaying her arms in time with the dancers .
the neurologist was astounded and gauthier and his team were over the moon . now they have trouble keeping up with the demand for dance therapy . good alternative to nicole kidman gauthier 's sense of community not only drives his outreach , it also keeps him from raising ticket prices .

" the plight of the civilians still trapped by the fighting and who remain at extreme risk from the ongoing hostilities is our primary concern , " the eu presidency said in a statement .
" the eu strongly condemns the killings of civilians and calls on all parties to take all necessary action to avoid further civilian casualties .
" the eu condemns in the strongest possible terms the ltte -lrb- liberation tigers of tamil eelam -rrb- for the use of civilians as human shields .
" both the government of sri lanka and the ltte must fully comply with international humanitarian law and ensure the protection of civilians at all times . "
the united nations has estimated that up to 50,000 civilians are caught in the conflict area while the sri lankan government says it is closer 15,000-20,000 .
the tigers insist the real figure is 165,000 .
the eu backed the un secretary general 's decision to send humanitarian chief john holmes to the temporary ceasefire zone saturday , and called on colombo to allow it unhindered access .
the un estimates that as many as 6,500 civilians may have been killed and another 14,000 wounded in the fighting this year , diplomats said .
independent verification of casualty figures is almost impossible as journalists have long been barred from the island 's north , except when under strict supervision on trips organized by the military .
un humanitarian chief visits war-torn island holmes was due in sri lanka saturday to start a three-day mission which will focus on pushing the government to facilitate humanitarian missions in and around the conflict zone and to allow proper access to tens of thousands of displaced civilians , the un said .
bildunterschrift : sri lankan troops freed thousands of captives after a battle with tamil tigers earlier this week the plight and suffering of those caught in the fighting between government troops and tamil tiger rebels prompted us president barack obama 's administration on friday to urge an end to hostilities .
" we call on both sides to stop fighting immediately and allow civilians to safely leave the combat zone , " the white house said in a statement .
the sri lankan government has so far resisted all calls to halt an offensive that is now on the brink of wiping out the ltte , who have been fighting for an independent tamil homeland since 1972 .
the tigers , once one of the most feared guerrilla organizations in the world , have seen their territory shrink to a sliver of land on the northeast coast estimated to measure 10 square kilometers -lrb- about four square miles -rrb- .
the white house specifically demanded an end to any military shelling in a designated " safe zone " and access for aid groups and journalists to civilians who have escaped .
the ltte issued their own call for foreign intervention , warning of " imminent " starvation among civilians and even suggesting that the situation could deteriorate into a crisis as appalling as that in the darfur region of sudan .
white house warns of a future of repercussions the white house statement warned that the government risked sowing the seeds of future ethnic conflict on the sinhalese-majority island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final push to end the tigers resistance has proved particularly bloody " it would compound the current tragedy if the military end of the conflict only breeds further enmity and ends hopes for reconciliation and a unified sri lanka in the future , " the white house said .
around 110,000 civilians managed to get out of the battle zone earlier in the week , overwhelming the government authorities handling relief operations .
the sri lankan government has been blocking most aid agencies from the war-torn north for months , and accuses un agencies and ngos of supporting the tamil tigers .
the un security council president , mexican ambassador claude heller , said the sri lankan government should allow the un and red cross to access all sites where displaced people were being registered and provided with shelter , according to un spokeswoman marie okabe .
despite this , sri lanka 's human rights minister mahinda samarasinghe welcomed the visit by holmes , his second in as many months .
" we hope to have a constructive discussion with him , " samarasinghe said .

according to the list , the banks with the worst credit and asset problems include hypo real estate , commerzbank and several state banks . commerzbank 's share of the toxic assets amounts to 101 billion euros , with 49 billion of those coming from the recently acquired dresdner bank .
hypo real estate , which is looking at a likely 90-percent takeover by the german government , has 268 billion euros in toxic assets on its books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal finance minister peer steinbrueck said the leak was " not funny " in a statement given to reuters on saturday , german finance minster peer steinbrueck said that no conclusions can be drawn from the figures in the list .
steinbrueck told reuters that it was “ regrettable " that the list was made public .
he said it was " not funny . "
oversight goup bafin has opened an investigation to try to to find out who was behind the leak .
bafin has indicated that the status of some of the toxic assets has changed since the list was compiled .
the sueddeutsche zeitung reported that the information contained in the list dates back to february 26 .
state banks affected the list names several german state banks among those with the most troubled assets , some 180 billion euros .
steinbrueck is scheduled to meet with german state premiers on monday to discuss the future of the state banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate has some of the highest toxic asset levels among german banks at issue are two potential solutions for the toxic asset crisis .
the first involves revaluing the bad assets through a neutral third party , and the other involves collecting the bad assets and giving banks a guarantee against the debt on their balance sheets .
these assets would be backed by the german government , and are reported to be favored by the state banks .
according to a report by the german magazine der spiegel , the state premiers are urgently hoping for results at monday 's meeting .

" two hundred shows as romeo are enough , " he said , adding that dance lovers in stuttgart could also do with a fresh approach to the art form . having persuaded the city 's private theaterhaus to give his idea a try , he recruited six young dancers , and gauthier dance was born .
over the past one-and-a-half seasons , the company has blurred the border between dance and theater , and the public has loved it .
what started as an experiment has now established itself as stuttgart 's " other " dance company . real life issues on stage their work is a blend of grace and slapstick , performed to music as diverse as bach and amy winehouse .
its mix of pensive melancholy and sheer fun has attracted old and new dance fans alike . as a dancer and particularly as a choreographer , gauthier said he sees himself as a storyteller .
he takes thumbnail sketches of life and weaves them into his works for the dance stage .
boy meets girl , yearning for home , jealousy , getting old - these are some of the subjects he deals with , all with a liberal dash of irony and humor . his shows , however , are neither cabaret nor burlesque .

for that purpose , eric gauthier has launched a community outreach program called " gauthier dance mobil . " the son of a canadian alzheimer 's specialist , gauthier saw first-hand as a child how therapeutic the performing arts can be in reaching people locked in by illness . when he started his company , he was determined to take dance into convalescent homes , children 's hospitals and social centers - places where people need distraction from the everyday challenges of their illnesses .
many of them had never been exposed to dance as an art before . while doing a show in a luxemburg hospital , a woman who had n't moved in years suddenly started swaying her arms in time with the dancers .
the neurologist was astounded and gauthier and his team were over the moon . now they have trouble keeping up with the demand for dance therapy . good alternative to nicole kidman gauthier 's sense of community not only drives his outreach , it also keeps him from raising ticket prices .

the troop makes its fresh approach to dance accessible to everyone - especially people in need . " let 's have skater kids come see dance ! "
that was the idea behind stuttgart 's new dance company , gauthier dance . canadian eric gauthier has a reputation in the city for unorthodox ways of doing things . many on the scene thought he was crazy to give up a prime post as soloist with the renowned stuttgart ballet and set up his own dance group , especially at a time when financial cuts have meant ballet companies all over the country are watching the last curtain come down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauthier dance does n't just keep to the stage gauthier , however , wanted to break with classical repertoire . " two hundred shows as romeo are enough , " he said , adding that dance lovers in stuttgart could also do with a fresh approach to the art form . having persuaded the city 's private theaterhaus to give his idea a try , he recruited six young dancers , and gauthier dance was born .
over the past one-and-a-half seasons , the company has blurred the border between dance and theater , and the public has loved it .
what started as an experiment has now established itself as stuttgart 's " other " dance company . real life issues on stage their work is a blend of grace and slapstick , performed to music as diverse as bach and amy winehouse .
its mix of pensive melancholy and sheer fun has attracted old and new dance fans alike . as a dancer and particularly as a choreographer , gauthier said he sees himself as a storyteller .
he takes thumbnail sketches of life and weaves them into his works for the dance stage .
boy meets girl , yearning for home , jealousy , getting old - these are some of the subjects he deals with , all with a liberal dash of irony and humor . his shows , however , are neither cabaret nor burlesque .
they are performances danced by classically trained dancers who give the audience back a quality often missing in the world of modern dance - namely , charm . affordable dance therapy bildunterschrift : sets are often minimal in gauthier 's performances for the company , dance is not just a self-serving art , but also a vehicle to help people in need .
for that purpose , eric gauthier has launched a community outreach program called " gauthier dance mobil . " the son of a canadian alzheimer 's specialist , gauthier saw first-hand as a child how therapeutic the performing arts can be in reaching people locked in by illness . when he started his company , he was determined to take dance into convalescent homes , children 's hospitals and social centers - places where people need distraction from the everyday challenges of their illnesses .
many of them had never been exposed to dance as an art before . while doing a show in a luxemburg hospital , a woman who had n't moved in years suddenly started swaying her arms in time with the dancers .
the neurologist was astounded and gauthier and his team were over the moon . now they have trouble keeping up with the demand for dance therapy . good alternative to nicole kidman gauthier 's sense of community not only drives his outreach , it also keeps him from raising ticket prices .
putting on an appealing , highly professional dance show is an expensive business , but gauthier dance are experts in cost cutting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauthier does n't stick to tradition while no expense is spared on the lighting - a crucial element in a dance performance - sets are often recycled or non-existent .
costumes from previous shows may be retailored or spruced up with inexpensive additions . " i keep the ticket prices very low because i want people to say , ' shall we go to the cinema and see nicole kidman or go see gauthier dance ? " ' said gauthier .

" the plight of the civilians still trapped by the fighting and who remain at extreme risk from the ongoing hostilities is our primary concern , " the eu presidency said in a statement .
" the eu strongly condemns the killings of civilians and calls on all parties to take all necessary action to avoid further civilian casualties .
" the eu condemns in the strongest possible terms the ltte -lrb- liberation tigers of tamil eelam -rrb- for the use of civilians as human shields .
" both the government of sri lanka and the ltte must fully comply with international humanitarian law and ensure the protection of civilians at all times . "
the united nations has estimated that up to 50,000 civilians are caught in the conflict area while the sri lankan government says it is closer 15,000-20,000 .
the tigers insist the real figure is 165,000 .
the eu backed the un secretary general 's decision to send humanitarian chief john holmes to the temporary ceasefire zone saturday , and called on colombo to allow it unhindered access .
the un estimates that as many as 6,500 civilians may have been killed and another 14,000 wounded in the fighting this year , diplomats said .
independent verification of casualty figures is almost impossible as journalists have long been barred from the island 's north , except when under strict supervision on trips organized by the military .
un humanitarian chief visits war-torn island holmes was due in sri lanka saturday to start a three-day mission which will focus on pushing the government to facilitate humanitarian missions in and around the conflict zone and to allow proper access to tens of thousands of displaced civilians , the un said .

" we call on both sides to stop fighting immediately and allow civilians to safely leave the combat zone , " the white house said in a statement .
the sri lankan government has so far resisted all calls to halt an offensive that is now on the brink of wiping out the ltte , who have been fighting for an independent tamil homeland since 1972 .
the tigers , once one of the most feared guerrilla organizations in the world , have seen their territory shrink to a sliver of land on the northeast coast estimated to measure 10 square kilometers -lrb- about four square miles -rrb- .
the white house specifically demanded an end to any military shelling in a designated " safe zone " and access for aid groups and journalists to civilians who have escaped .
the ltte issued their own call for foreign intervention , warning of " imminent " starvation among civilians and even suggesting that the situation could deteriorate into a crisis as appalling as that in the darfur region of sudan .
white house warns of a future of repercussions the white house statement warned that the government risked sowing the seeds of future ethnic conflict on the sinhalese-majority island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final push to end the tigers resistance has proved particularly bloody " it would compound the current tragedy if the military end of the conflict only breeds further enmity and ends hopes for reconciliation and a unified sri lanka in the future , " the white house said .
around 110,000 civilians managed to get out of the battle zone earlier in the week , overwhelming the government authorities handling relief operations .
the sri lankan government has been blocking most aid agencies from the war-torn north for months , and accuses un agencies and ngos of supporting the tamil tigers .
the un security council president , mexican ambassador claude heller , said the sri lankan government should allow the un and red cross to access all sites where displaced people were being registered and provided with shelter , according to un spokeswoman marie okabe .
despite this , sri lanka 's human rights minister mahinda samarasinghe welcomed the visit by holmes , his second in as many months .

" both the government of sri lanka and the ltte must fully comply with international humanitarian law and ensure the protection of civilians at all times . "
the united nations has estimated that up to 50,000 civilians are caught in the conflict area while the sri lankan government says it is closer 15,000-20,000 .

the un estimates that as many as 6,500 civilians may have been killed and another 14,000 wounded in the fighting this year , diplomats said .
independent verification of casualty figures is almost impossible as journalists have long been barred from the island 's north , except when under strict supervision on trips organized by the military .

the tigers insist the real figure is 165,000 .
the eu backed the un secretary general 's decision to send humanitarian chief john holmes to the temporary ceasefire zone saturday , and called on colombo to allow it unhindered access .
the un estimates that as many as 6,500 civilians may have been killed and another 14,000 wounded in the fighting this year , diplomats said .

the sri lankan government has so far resisted all calls to halt an offensive that is now on the brink of wiping out the ltte , who have been fighting for an independent tamil homeland since 1972 .
the tigers , once one of the most feared guerrilla organizations in the world , have seen their territory shrink to a sliver of land on the northeast coast estimated to measure 10 square kilometers -lrb- about four square miles -rrb- .
the white house specifically demanded an end to any military shelling in a designated " safe zone " and access for aid groups and journalists to civilians who have escaped .
the ltte issued their own call for foreign intervention , warning of " imminent " starvation among civilians and even suggesting that the situation could deteriorate into a crisis as appalling as that in the darfur region of sudan .

the companies stand accused for aiding pyongyang 's missile and nuclear programmes .

the freighter was sailing under under the flag of malta . " i hear it was taken early this morning , " said andrew mwangura , director of the mombasa-based east african seafarers assistance program , in a statement released on saturday . ministry officials in berlin could not confirm the reports but said investigations were under way . piracy attacks off the eastern african coast have escalated in the past few weeks despite the presence of a flotilla of foreign navy warships in the region . pirates there are holding more than 250 hostages and have made millions of dollars through ransoms , driving up insurance costs .
some shipping lines now opt to use a longer and more expensive route around the cape of good hope to avoid capture . nato extends anti-piracy mission the attack comes just a day after nato decided to extend its anti-piracy work off the coast of somalia . " nato has decided to continue the counter-piracy activities off somalia in the gulf of aden , " said a spokesman for the transatlantic alliance at its brussels headquarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato ships will continue to patrol the gulf of aden four vessels from nato 's standing naval maritime group one have been conducting anti-piracy work and escorting merchant ships , including some carrying food aid for somalia , since last month . the naval ships were due to make courtesy port visits to karachi in pakistan , singapore and perth in western australia , but the last two visits have been cancelled , the spokeswoman said . they now will break off to visit karachi on april 26-27 but will return to continue their counter-piracy work until june 6 . " with the great increase in pirate attacks and the ensuing international attention , nato 's recent contribution to counter-piracy has been significant , " the spokeswoman said . pirates attacked over 130 merchant ships in the gulf of aden last year – more than double last year 's total , according to the international maritime bureau . attacks increased tenfold in the first three months of 2009 compared to the same period last year . nda / jam , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what ’ s the place of religion in the classroom ?
in berlin a referendum will on sunday ask that very question .
currently , the subject of ethics is obligatory and courses in different religious faiths are optional . unlike in most of germany , pupils in the capital berlin do not attend mandatory religion classes . the pupils can however if they decide to opt for extra-curricular lessons in their religious confession .
ethics , on the other hand , is a core subject . the city is divided over the issue .
faith groups say that religion is being marginalized in berlin , while supporters of ethics courses say it is essential for an international town like berlin , where different faiths , ethnicities and other groups live side by side , to have a general subject on morals , ethics and values . the initiative " pro-religion " has been campaigning that students should be able to choose between either ethics or religion . fundamental issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam courses are an option along with catholic or protestant ones volker ladenthin , professor of education at bonn university , is in favor of leaving the system the way it is , arguing that ethics is too much of a fundamental issue to be optional . " students are facing highly complex problems in our society , " he said .
" for that they need to know how to approach such problems , how to deal with them , how to make decisions based on values . " he adds that ethics courses are needed to familiarize students with the values that a society is based on , to make them think about and - it is hoped - adopt those values . the ethics course is not limited to one religious confession , and its supporters say that in a multi-cultural and multi-religious society that 's a crucial advantage .
the subject became part of the capital 's core curriculum in 2006 in the wake of a so-called honor killing within berlin 's turkish community , which raised questions about faith and moral values being taught to the younger generation . religion goes further religion as a subject is confession-based , with students segregated according to faith .
father hans langendörfer of the german bishops conference argues that religion as a subject not only covers the ground of ethics but goes much further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's controversy as to whether ethics courses are the better way to instill morals and values " teaching religion is of course not identical with teaching ethics , " he said .
" religion asks questions about god , about meaning , sense and perspective in our lives .
of course that includes many ethical issues but it 's more than simply teaching the values of our society . " the crucial difference he adds is that in ethics , students simply debate what could be done in a given situation or problem .
but religion tells the students what they should do . " the subject of religion gives you an orientation in life , " he says .
" of course that 's linked to ethical values but it actually urges you to fulfill these . " but others insist that ethics is a fundamental issue that only can be complemented but not replaced by religion .
there are no calls that religion as such should vanish from the curriculum – but simply that it should not become mandatory again . professor ladenthin is convinced that ethics is a subject just as important as any of the other traditional core subjects . " it has to be mandatory – just as physics for instance is mandatory , " he says .
" we can not walk on the ceiling or on the wall – even if we may want to .
physical laws tell us that it 's simply impossible .
and in the very same manner , ethical laws tell us what 's morally wrong and what 's right . " yet for many parents in germany , ethics is the only option anyway .

what ’ s the place of religion in the classroom ?
in berlin a referendum will on sunday ask that very question .
currently , the subject of ethics is obligatory and courses in different religious faiths are optional . unlike in most of germany , pupils in the capital berlin do not attend mandatory religion classes . the pupils can however if they decide to opt for extra-curricular lessons in their religious confession .
ethics , on the other hand , is a core subject . the city is divided over the issue .
faith groups say that religion is being marginalized in berlin , while supporters of ethics courses say it is essential for an international town like berlin , where different faiths , ethnicities and other groups live side by side , to have a general subject on morals , ethics and values . the initiative " pro-religion " has been campaigning that students should be able to choose between either ethics or religion . fundamental issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam courses are an option along with catholic or protestant ones volker ladenthin , professor of education at bonn university , is in favor of leaving the system the way it is , arguing that ethics is too much of a fundamental issue to be optional . " students are facing highly complex problems in our society , " he said .
" for that they need to know how to approach such problems , how to deal with them , how to make decisions based on values . " he adds that ethics courses are needed to familiarize students with the values that a society is based on , to make them think about and - it is hoped - adopt those values . the ethics course is not limited to one religious confession , and its supporters say that in a multi-cultural and multi-religious society that 's a crucial advantage .
the subject became part of the capital 's core curriculum in 2006 in the wake of a so-called honor killing within berlin 's turkish community , which raised questions about faith and moral values being taught to the younger generation . religion goes further religion as a subject is confession-based , with students segregated according to faith .
father hans langendörfer of the german bishops conference argues that religion as a subject not only covers the ground of ethics but goes much further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's controversy as to whether ethics courses are the better way to instill morals and values " teaching religion is of course not identical with teaching ethics , " he said .
" religion asks questions about god , about meaning , sense and perspective in our lives .
of course that includes many ethical issues but it 's more than simply teaching the values of our society . " the crucial difference he adds is that in ethics , students simply debate what could be done in a given situation or problem .
but religion tells the students what they should do . " the subject of religion gives you an orientation in life , " he says .
" of course that 's linked to ethical values but it actually urges you to fulfill these . " but others insist that ethics is a fundamental issue that only can be complemented but not replaced by religion .
there are no calls that religion as such should vanish from the curriculum – but simply that it should not become mandatory again . professor ladenthin is convinced that ethics is a subject just as important as any of the other traditional core subjects . " it has to be mandatory – just as physics for instance is mandatory , " he says .
" we can not walk on the ceiling or on the wall – even if we may want to .
physical laws tell us that it 's simply impossible .
and in the very same manner , ethical laws tell us what 's morally wrong and what 's right . " yet for many parents in germany , ethics is the only option anyway .
the country is largely secular .

what ’ s the place of religion in the classroom ?
in berlin a referendum will on sunday ask that very question .
currently , the subject of ethics is obligatory and courses in different religious faiths are optional . unlike in most of germany , pupils in the capital berlin do not attend mandatory religion classes . the pupils can however if they decide to opt for extra-curricular lessons in their religious confession .
ethics , on the other hand , is a core subject . the city is divided over the issue .
faith groups say that religion is being marginalized in berlin , while supporters of ethics courses say it is essential for an international town like berlin , where different faiths , ethnicities and other groups live side by side , to have a general subject on morals , ethics and values . the initiative " pro-religion " has been campaigning that students should be able to choose between either ethics or religion . fundamental issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam courses are an option along with catholic or protestant ones volker ladenthin , professor of education at bonn university , is in favor of leaving the system the way it is , arguing that ethics is too much of a fundamental issue to be optional . " students are facing highly complex problems in our society , " he said .
" for that they need to know how to approach such problems , how to deal with them , how to make decisions based on values . " he adds that ethics courses are needed to familiarize students with the values that a society is based on , to make them think about and - it is hoped - adopt those values . the ethics course is not limited to one religious confession , and its supporters say that in a multi-cultural and multi-religious society that 's a crucial advantage .
the subject became part of the capital 's core curriculum in 2006 in the wake of a so-called honor killing within berlin 's turkish community , which raised questions about faith and moral values being taught to the younger generation . religion goes further religion as a subject is confession-based , with students segregated according to faith .
father hans langendörfer of the german bishops conference argues that religion as a subject not only covers the ground of ethics but goes much further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's controversy as to whether ethics courses are the better way to instill morals and values " teaching religion is of course not identical with teaching ethics , " he said .
" religion asks questions about god , about meaning , sense and perspective in our lives .
of course that includes many ethical issues but it 's more than simply teaching the values of our society . " the crucial difference he adds is that in ethics , students simply debate what could be done in a given situation or problem .
but religion tells the students what they should do . " the subject of religion gives you an orientation in life , " he says .
" of course that 's linked to ethical values but it actually urges you to fulfill these . " but others insist that ethics is a fundamental issue that only can be complemented but not replaced by religion .
there are no calls that religion as such should vanish from the curriculum – but simply that it should not become mandatory again . professor ladenthin is convinced that ethics is a subject just as important as any of the other traditional core subjects . " it has to be mandatory – just as physics for instance is mandatory , " he says .
" we can not walk on the ceiling or on the wall – even if we may want to .
physical laws tell us that it 's simply impossible .
and in the very same manner , ethical laws tell us what 's morally wrong and what 's right . " yet for many parents in germany , ethics is the only option anyway .
the country is largely secular .
while two-thirds of germans officially belong to a faith , only a fraction of them actually go to church . author : katrin schilling / andreas illmer editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the troop makes its fresh approach to dance accessible to everyone - especially people in need . " let 's have skater kids come see dance ! "
that was the idea behind stuttgart 's new dance company , gauthier dance . canadian eric gauthier has a reputation in the city for unorthodox ways of doing things . many on the scene thought he was crazy to give up a prime post as soloist with the renowned stuttgart ballet and set up his own dance group , especially at a time when financial cuts have meant ballet companies all over the country are watching the last curtain come down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauthier dance does n't just keep to the stage gauthier , however , wanted to break with classical repertoire . " two hundred shows as romeo are enough , " he said , adding that dance lovers in stuttgart could also do with a fresh approach to the art form . having persuaded the city 's private theaterhaus to give his idea a try , he recruited six young dancers , and gauthier dance was born .
over the past one-and-a-half seasons , the company has blurred the border between dance and theater , and the public has loved it .
what started as an experiment has now established itself as stuttgart 's " other " dance company . real life issues on stage their work is a blend of grace and slapstick , performed to music as diverse as bach and amy winehouse .
its mix of pensive melancholy and sheer fun has attracted old and new dance fans alike . as a dancer and particularly as a choreographer , gauthier said he sees himself as a storyteller .
he takes thumbnail sketches of life and weaves them into his works for the dance stage .
boy meets girl , yearning for home , jealousy , getting old - these are some of the subjects he deals with , all with a liberal dash of irony and humor . his shows , however , are neither cabaret nor burlesque .
they are performances danced by classically trained dancers who give the audience back a quality often missing in the world of modern dance - namely , charm . affordable dance therapy bildunterschrift : sets are often minimal in gauthier 's performances for the company , dance is not just a self-serving art , but also a vehicle to help people in need .
for that purpose , eric gauthier has launched a community outreach program called " gauthier dance mobil . " the son of a canadian alzheimer 's specialist , gauthier saw first-hand as a child how therapeutic the performing arts can be in reaching people locked in by illness . when he started his company , he was determined to take dance into convalescent homes , children 's hospitals and social centers - places where people need distraction from the everyday challenges of their illnesses .
many of them had never been exposed to dance as an art before . while doing a show in a luxemburg hospital , a woman who had n't moved in years suddenly started swaying her arms in time with the dancers .
the neurologist was astounded and gauthier and his team were over the moon . now they have trouble keeping up with the demand for dance therapy . good alternative to nicole kidman gauthier 's sense of community not only drives his outreach , it also keeps him from raising ticket prices .
putting on an appealing , highly professional dance show is an expensive business , but gauthier dance are experts in cost cutting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauthier does n't stick to tradition while no expense is spared on the lighting - a crucial element in a dance performance - sets are often recycled or non-existent .
costumes from previous shows may be retailored or spruced up with inexpensive additions . " i keep the ticket prices very low because i want people to say , ' shall we go to the cinema and see nicole kidman or go see gauthier dance ? " ' said gauthier .
" and they know that both things are going to be affordable and great fun . " author : peggy graham editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the troop makes its fresh approach to dance accessible to everyone - especially people in need . " let 's have skater kids come see dance ! "
that was the idea behind stuttgart 's new dance company , gauthier dance . canadian eric gauthier has a reputation in the city for unorthodox ways of doing things . many on the scene thought he was crazy to give up a prime post as soloist with the renowned stuttgart ballet and set up his own dance group , especially at a time when financial cuts have meant ballet companies all over the country are watching the last curtain come down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauthier dance does n't just keep to the stage gauthier , however , wanted to break with classical repertoire . " two hundred shows as romeo are enough , " he said , adding that dance lovers in stuttgart could also do with a fresh approach to the art form . having persuaded the city 's private theaterhaus to give his idea a try , he recruited six young dancers , and gauthier dance was born .
over the past one-and-a-half seasons , the company has blurred the border between dance and theater , and the public has loved it .
what started as an experiment has now established itself as stuttgart 's " other " dance company . real life issues on stage their work is a blend of grace and slapstick , performed to music as diverse as bach and amy winehouse .
its mix of pensive melancholy and sheer fun has attracted old and new dance fans alike . as a dancer and particularly as a choreographer , gauthier said he sees himself as a storyteller .
he takes thumbnail sketches of life and weaves them into his works for the dance stage .
boy meets girl , yearning for home , jealousy , getting old - these are some of the subjects he deals with , all with a liberal dash of irony and humor . his shows , however , are neither cabaret nor burlesque .
they are performances danced by classically trained dancers who give the audience back a quality often missing in the world of modern dance - namely , charm . affordable dance therapy bildunterschrift : sets are often minimal in gauthier 's performances for the company , dance is not just a self-serving art , but also a vehicle to help people in need .
for that purpose , eric gauthier has launched a community outreach program called " gauthier dance mobil . " the son of a canadian alzheimer 's specialist , gauthier saw first-hand as a child how therapeutic the performing arts can be in reaching people locked in by illness . when he started his company , he was determined to take dance into convalescent homes , children 's hospitals and social centers - places where people need distraction from the everyday challenges of their illnesses .
many of them had never been exposed to dance as an art before . while doing a show in a luxemburg hospital , a woman who had n't moved in years suddenly started swaying her arms in time with the dancers .
the neurologist was astounded and gauthier and his team were over the moon . now they have trouble keeping up with the demand for dance therapy . good alternative to nicole kidman gauthier 's sense of community not only drives his outreach , it also keeps him from raising ticket prices .
putting on an appealing , highly professional dance show is an expensive business , but gauthier dance are experts in cost cutting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauthier does n't stick to tradition while no expense is spared on the lighting - a crucial element in a dance performance - sets are often recycled or non-existent .
costumes from previous shows may be retailored or spruced up with inexpensive additions . " i keep the ticket prices very low because i want people to say , ' shall we go to the cinema and see nicole kidman or go see gauthier dance ? " ' said gauthier .
" and they know that both things are going to be affordable and great fun . " author : peggy graham editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the troop makes its fresh approach to dance accessible to everyone - especially people in need . " let 's have skater kids come see dance ! "
that was the idea behind stuttgart 's new dance company , gauthier dance . canadian eric gauthier has a reputation in the city for unorthodox ways of doing things . many on the scene thought he was crazy to give up a prime post as soloist with the renowned stuttgart ballet and set up his own dance group , especially at a time when financial cuts have meant ballet companies all over the country are watching the last curtain come down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauthier dance does n't just keep to the stage gauthier , however , wanted to break with classical repertoire . " two hundred shows as romeo are enough , " he said , adding that dance lovers in stuttgart could also do with a fresh approach to the art form . having persuaded the city 's private theaterhaus to give his idea a try , he recruited six young dancers , and gauthier dance was born .
over the past one-and-a-half seasons , the company has blurred the border between dance and theater , and the public has loved it .
what started as an experiment has now established itself as stuttgart 's " other " dance company . real life issues on stage their work is a blend of grace and slapstick , performed to music as diverse as bach and amy winehouse .
its mix of pensive melancholy and sheer fun has attracted old and new dance fans alike . as a dancer and particularly as a choreographer , gauthier said he sees himself as a storyteller .
he takes thumbnail sketches of life and weaves them into his works for the dance stage .
boy meets girl , yearning for home , jealousy , getting old - these are some of the subjects he deals with , all with a liberal dash of irony and humor . his shows , however , are neither cabaret nor burlesque .
they are performances danced by classically trained dancers who give the audience back a quality often missing in the world of modern dance - namely , charm . affordable dance therapy bildunterschrift : sets are often minimal in gauthier 's performances for the company , dance is not just a self-serving art , but also a vehicle to help people in need .
for that purpose , eric gauthier has launched a community outreach program called " gauthier dance mobil . " the son of a canadian alzheimer 's specialist , gauthier saw first-hand as a child how therapeutic the performing arts can be in reaching people locked in by illness . when he started his company , he was determined to take dance into convalescent homes , children 's hospitals and social centers - places where people need distraction from the everyday challenges of their illnesses .
many of them had never been exposed to dance as an art before . while doing a show in a luxemburg hospital , a woman who had n't moved in years suddenly started swaying her arms in time with the dancers .
the neurologist was astounded and gauthier and his team were over the moon . now they have trouble keeping up with the demand for dance therapy . good alternative to nicole kidman gauthier 's sense of community not only drives his outreach , it also keeps him from raising ticket prices .
putting on an appealing , highly professional dance show is an expensive business , but gauthier dance are experts in cost cutting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauthier does n't stick to tradition while no expense is spared on the lighting - a crucial element in a dance performance - sets are often recycled or non-existent .
costumes from previous shows may be retailored or spruced up with inexpensive additions . " i keep the ticket prices very low because i want people to say , ' shall we go to the cinema and see nicole kidman or go see gauthier dance ? " ' said gauthier .
" and they know that both things are going to be affordable and great fun . " author : peggy graham editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what ’ s the place of religion in the classroom ?
in berlin a referendum will on sunday ask that very question .
currently , the subject of ethics is obligatory and courses in different religious faiths are optional . unlike in most of germany , pupils in the capital berlin do not attend mandatory religion classes . the pupils can however if they decide to opt for extra-curricular lessons in their religious confession .
ethics , on the other hand , is a core subject . the city is divided over the issue .
faith groups say that religion is being marginalized in berlin , while supporters of ethics courses say it is essential for an international town like berlin , where different faiths , ethnicities and other groups live side by side , to have a general subject on morals , ethics and values . the initiative " pro-religion " has been campaigning that students should be able to choose between either ethics or religion . fundamental issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam courses are an option along with catholic or protestant ones volker ladenthin , professor of education at bonn university , is in favor of leaving the system the way it is , arguing that ethics is too much of a fundamental issue to be optional . " students are facing highly complex problems in our society , " he said .
" for that they need to know how to approach such problems , how to deal with them , how to make decisions based on values . " he adds that ethics courses are needed to familiarize students with the values that a society is based on , to make them think about and - it is hoped - adopt those values . the ethics course is not limited to one religious confession , and its supporters say that in a multi-cultural and multi-religious society that 's a crucial advantage .
the subject became part of the capital 's core curriculum in 2006 in the wake of a so-called honor killing within berlin 's turkish community , which raised questions about faith and moral values being taught to the younger generation . religion goes further religion as a subject is confession-based , with students segregated according to faith .
father hans langendörfer of the german bishops conference argues that religion as a subject not only covers the ground of ethics but goes much further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's controversy as to whether ethics courses are the better way to instill morals and values " teaching religion is of course not identical with teaching ethics , " he said .
" religion asks questions about god , about meaning , sense and perspective in our lives .
of course that includes many ethical issues but it 's more than simply teaching the values of our society . " the crucial difference he adds is that in ethics , students simply debate what could be done in a given situation or problem .
but religion tells the students what they should do . " the subject of religion gives you an orientation in life , " he says .
" of course that 's linked to ethical values but it actually urges you to fulfill these . " but others insist that ethics is a fundamental issue that only can be complemented but not replaced by religion .
there are no calls that religion as such should vanish from the curriculum – but simply that it should not become mandatory again . professor ladenthin is convinced that ethics is a subject just as important as any of the other traditional core subjects . " it has to be mandatory – just as physics for instance is mandatory , " he says .
" we can not walk on the ceiling or on the wall – even if we may want to .
physical laws tell us that it 's simply impossible .
and in the very same manner , ethical laws tell us what 's morally wrong and what 's right . " yet for many parents in germany , ethics is the only option anyway .

what ’ s the place of religion in the classroom ?
in berlin a referendum will on sunday ask that very question .
currently , the subject of ethics is obligatory and courses in different religious faiths are optional . unlike in most of germany , pupils in the capital berlin do not attend mandatory religion classes . the pupils can however if they decide to opt for extra-curricular lessons in their religious confession .
ethics , on the other hand , is a core subject . the city is divided over the issue .
faith groups say that religion is being marginalized in berlin , while supporters of ethics courses say it is essential for an international town like berlin , where different faiths , ethnicities and other groups live side by side , to have a general subject on morals , ethics and values . the initiative " pro-religion " has been campaigning that students should be able to choose between either ethics or religion . fundamental issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam courses are an option along with catholic or protestant ones volker ladenthin , professor of education at bonn university , is in favor of leaving the system the way it is , arguing that ethics is too much of a fundamental issue to be optional . " students are facing highly complex problems in our society , " he said .
" for that they need to know how to approach such problems , how to deal with them , how to make decisions based on values . " he adds that ethics courses are needed to familiarize students with the values that a society is based on , to make them think about and - it is hoped - adopt those values . the ethics course is not limited to one religious confession , and its supporters say that in a multi-cultural and multi-religious society that 's a crucial advantage .
the subject became part of the capital 's core curriculum in 2006 in the wake of a so-called honor killing within berlin 's turkish community , which raised questions about faith and moral values being taught to the younger generation . religion goes further religion as a subject is confession-based , with students segregated according to faith .
father hans langendörfer of the german bishops conference argues that religion as a subject not only covers the ground of ethics but goes much further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's controversy as to whether ethics courses are the better way to instill morals and values " teaching religion is of course not identical with teaching ethics , " he said .
" religion asks questions about god , about meaning , sense and perspective in our lives .
of course that includes many ethical issues but it 's more than simply teaching the values of our society . " the crucial difference he adds is that in ethics , students simply debate what could be done in a given situation or problem .
but religion tells the students what they should do . " the subject of religion gives you an orientation in life , " he says .

that was the idea behind stuttgart 's new dance company , gauthier dance . canadian eric gauthier has a reputation in the city for unorthodox ways of doing things . many on the scene thought he was crazy to give up a prime post as soloist with the renowned stuttgart ballet and set up his own dance group , especially at a time when financial cuts have meant ballet companies all over the country are watching the last curtain come down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauthier dance does n't just keep to the stage gauthier , however , wanted to break with classical repertoire .

" the plight of the civilians still trapped by the fighting and who remain at extreme risk from the ongoing hostilities is our primary concern , " the eu presidency said in a statement .
" the eu strongly condemns the killings of civilians and calls on all parties to take all necessary action to avoid further civilian casualties .
" the eu condemns in the strongest possible terms the ltte -lrb- liberation tigers of tamil eelam -rrb- for the use of civilians as human shields .
" both the government of sri lanka and the ltte must fully comply with international humanitarian law and ensure the protection of civilians at all times . "
the united nations has estimated that up to 50,000 civilians are caught in the conflict area while the sri lankan government says it is closer 15,000-20,000 .
the tigers insist the real figure is 165,000 .
the eu backed the un secretary general 's decision to send humanitarian chief john holmes to the temporary ceasefire zone saturday , and called on colombo to allow it unhindered access .
the un estimates that as many as 6,500 civilians may have been killed and another 14,000 wounded in the fighting this year , diplomats said .
independent verification of casualty figures is almost impossible as journalists have long been barred from the island 's north , except when under strict supervision on trips organized by the military .
un humanitarian chief visits war-torn island holmes was due in sri lanka saturday to start a three-day mission which will focus on pushing the government to facilitate humanitarian missions in and around the conflict zone and to allow proper access to tens of thousands of displaced civilians , the un said .
bildunterschrift : sri lankan troops freed thousands of captives after a battle with tamil tigers earlier this week the plight and suffering of those caught in the fighting between government troops and tamil tiger rebels prompted us president barack obama 's administration on friday to urge an end to hostilities .
" we call on both sides to stop fighting immediately and allow civilians to safely leave the combat zone , " the white house said in a statement .
the sri lankan government has so far resisted all calls to halt an offensive that is now on the brink of wiping out the ltte , who have been fighting for an independent tamil homeland since 1972 .
the tigers , once one of the most feared guerrilla organizations in the world , have seen their territory shrink to a sliver of land on the northeast coast estimated to measure 10 square kilometers -lrb- about four square miles -rrb- .
the white house specifically demanded an end to any military shelling in a designated " safe zone " and access for aid groups and journalists to civilians who have escaped .
the ltte issued their own call for foreign intervention , warning of " imminent " starvation among civilians and even suggesting that the situation could deteriorate into a crisis as appalling as that in the darfur region of sudan .
white house warns of a future of repercussions the white house statement warned that the government risked sowing the seeds of future ethnic conflict on the sinhalese-majority island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final push to end the tigers resistance has proved particularly bloody " it would compound the current tragedy if the military end of the conflict only breeds further enmity and ends hopes for reconciliation and a unified sri lanka in the future , " the white house said .
around 110,000 civilians managed to get out of the battle zone earlier in the week , overwhelming the government authorities handling relief operations .
the sri lankan government has been blocking most aid agencies from the war-torn north for months , and accuses un agencies and ngos of supporting the tamil tigers .
the un security council president , mexican ambassador claude heller , said the sri lankan government should allow the un and red cross to access all sites where displaced people were being registered and provided with shelter , according to un spokeswoman marie okabe .
despite this , sri lanka 's human rights minister mahinda samarasinghe welcomed the visit by holmes , his second in as many months .
" we hope to have a constructive discussion with him , " samarasinghe said .

" the plight of the civilians still trapped by the fighting and who remain at extreme risk from the ongoing hostilities is our primary concern , " the eu presidency said in a statement .
" the eu strongly condemns the killings of civilians and calls on all parties to take all necessary action to avoid further civilian casualties .
" the eu condemns in the strongest possible terms the ltte -lrb- liberation tigers of tamil eelam -rrb- for the use of civilians as human shields .
" both the government of sri lanka and the ltte must fully comply with international humanitarian law and ensure the protection of civilians at all times . "
the united nations has estimated that up to 50,000 civilians are caught in the conflict area while the sri lankan government says it is closer 15,000-20,000 .
the tigers insist the real figure is 165,000 .
the eu backed the un secretary general 's decision to send humanitarian chief john holmes to the temporary ceasefire zone saturday , and called on colombo to allow it unhindered access .
the un estimates that as many as 6,500 civilians may have been killed and another 14,000 wounded in the fighting this year , diplomats said .
independent verification of casualty figures is almost impossible as journalists have long been barred from the island 's north , except when under strict supervision on trips organized by the military .

the sri lankan government has so far resisted all calls to halt an offensive that is now on the brink of wiping out the ltte , who have been fighting for an independent tamil homeland since 1972 .
the tigers , once one of the most feared guerrilla organizations in the world , have seen their territory shrink to a sliver of land on the northeast coast estimated to measure 10 square kilometers -lrb- about four square miles -rrb- .
the white house specifically demanded an end to any military shelling in a designated " safe zone " and access for aid groups and journalists to civilians who have escaped .
the ltte issued their own call for foreign intervention , warning of " imminent " starvation among civilians and even suggesting that the situation could deteriorate into a crisis as appalling as that in the darfur region of sudan .

" both the government of sri lanka and the ltte must fully comply with international humanitarian law and ensure the protection of civilians at all times . "
the united nations has estimated that up to 50,000 civilians are caught in the conflict area while the sri lankan government says it is closer 15,000-20,000 .

the sri lankan government has so far resisted all calls to halt an offensive that is now on the brink of wiping out the ltte , who have been fighting for an independent tamil homeland since 1972 .
the tigers , once one of the most feared guerrilla organizations in the world , have seen their territory shrink to a sliver of land on the northeast coast estimated to measure 10 square kilometers -lrb- about four square miles -rrb- .
the white house specifically demanded an end to any military shelling in a designated " safe zone " and access for aid groups and journalists to civilians who have escaped .
the ltte issued their own call for foreign intervention , warning of " imminent " starvation among civilians and even suggesting that the situation could deteriorate into a crisis as appalling as that in the darfur region of sudan .
white house warns of a future of repercussions the white house statement warned that the government risked sowing the seeds of future ethnic conflict on the sinhalese-majority island .

" the plight of the civilians still trapped by the fighting and who remain at extreme risk from the ongoing hostilities is our primary concern , " the eu presidency said in a statement .
" the eu strongly condemns the killings of civilians and calls on all parties to take all necessary action to avoid further civilian casualties .
" the eu condemns in the strongest possible terms the ltte -lrb- liberation tigers of tamil eelam -rrb- for the use of civilians as human shields .
" both the government of sri lanka and the ltte must fully comply with international humanitarian law and ensure the protection of civilians at all times . "
the united nations has estimated that up to 50,000 civilians are caught in the conflict area while the sri lankan government says it is closer 15,000-20,000 .
the tigers insist the real figure is 165,000 .
the eu backed the un secretary general 's decision to send humanitarian chief john holmes to the temporary ceasefire zone saturday , and called on colombo to allow it unhindered access .
the un estimates that as many as 6,500 civilians may have been killed and another 14,000 wounded in the fighting this year , diplomats said .
independent verification of casualty figures is almost impossible as journalists have long been barred from the island 's north , except when under strict supervision on trips organized by the military .
un humanitarian chief visits war-torn island holmes was due in sri lanka saturday to start a three-day mission which will focus on pushing the government to facilitate humanitarian missions in and around the conflict zone and to allow proper access to tens of thousands of displaced civilians , the un said .
bildunterschrift : sri lankan troops freed thousands of captives after a battle with tamil tigers earlier this week the plight and suffering of those caught in the fighting between government troops and tamil tiger rebels prompted us president barack obama 's administration on friday to urge an end to hostilities .
" we call on both sides to stop fighting immediately and allow civilians to safely leave the combat zone , " the white house said in a statement .
the sri lankan government has so far resisted all calls to halt an offensive that is now on the brink of wiping out the ltte , who have been fighting for an independent tamil homeland since 1972 .
the tigers , once one of the most feared guerrilla organizations in the world , have seen their territory shrink to a sliver of land on the northeast coast estimated to measure 10 square kilometers -lrb- about four square miles -rrb- .
the white house specifically demanded an end to any military shelling in a designated " safe zone " and access for aid groups and journalists to civilians who have escaped .
the ltte issued their own call for foreign intervention , warning of " imminent " starvation among civilians and even suggesting that the situation could deteriorate into a crisis as appalling as that in the darfur region of sudan .
white house warns of a future of repercussions the white house statement warned that the government risked sowing the seeds of future ethnic conflict on the sinhalese-majority island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final push to end the tigers resistance has proved particularly bloody " it would compound the current tragedy if the military end of the conflict only breeds further enmity and ends hopes for reconciliation and a unified sri lanka in the future , " the white house said .
around 110,000 civilians managed to get out of the battle zone earlier in the week , overwhelming the government authorities handling relief operations .
the sri lankan government has been blocking most aid agencies from the war-torn north for months , and accuses un agencies and ngos of supporting the tamil tigers .
the un security council president , mexican ambassador claude heller , said the sri lankan government should allow the un and red cross to access all sites where displaced people were being registered and provided with shelter , according to un spokeswoman marie okabe .
despite this , sri lanka 's human rights minister mahinda samarasinghe welcomed the visit by holmes , his second in as many months .
" we hope to have a constructive discussion with him , " samarasinghe said .

what ’ s the place of religion in the classroom ?
in berlin a referendum will on sunday ask that very question .
currently , the subject of ethics is obligatory and courses in different religious faiths are optional . unlike in most of germany , pupils in the capital berlin do not attend mandatory religion classes . the pupils can however if they decide to opt for extra-curricular lessons in their religious confession .
ethics , on the other hand , is a core subject . the city is divided over the issue .
faith groups say that religion is being marginalized in berlin , while supporters of ethics courses say it is essential for an international town like berlin , where different faiths , ethnicities and other groups live side by side , to have a general subject on morals , ethics and values . the initiative " pro-religion " has been campaigning that students should be able to choose between either ethics or religion . fundamental issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam courses are an option along with catholic or protestant ones volker ladenthin , professor of education at bonn university , is in favor of leaving the system the way it is , arguing that ethics is too much of a fundamental issue to be optional . " students are facing highly complex problems in our society , " he said .
" for that they need to know how to approach such problems , how to deal with them , how to make decisions based on values . " he adds that ethics courses are needed to familiarize students with the values that a society is based on , to make them think about and - it is hoped - adopt those values . the ethics course is not limited to one religious confession , and its supporters say that in a multi-cultural and multi-religious society that 's a crucial advantage .
the subject became part of the capital 's core curriculum in 2006 in the wake of a so-called honor killing within berlin 's turkish community , which raised questions about faith and moral values being taught to the younger generation . religion goes further religion as a subject is confession-based , with students segregated according to faith .
father hans langendörfer of the german bishops conference argues that religion as a subject not only covers the ground of ethics but goes much further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's controversy as to whether ethics courses are the better way to instill morals and values " teaching religion is of course not identical with teaching ethics , " he said .
" religion asks questions about god , about meaning , sense and perspective in our lives .
of course that includes many ethical issues but it 's more than simply teaching the values of our society . " the crucial difference he adds is that in ethics , students simply debate what could be done in a given situation or problem .
but religion tells the students what they should do . " the subject of religion gives you an orientation in life , " he says .
" of course that 's linked to ethical values but it actually urges you to fulfill these . " but others insist that ethics is a fundamental issue that only can be complemented but not replaced by religion .
there are no calls that religion as such should vanish from the curriculum – but simply that it should not become mandatory again . professor ladenthin is convinced that ethics is a subject just as important as any of the other traditional core subjects . " it has to be mandatory – just as physics for instance is mandatory , " he says .
" we can not walk on the ceiling or on the wall – even if we may want to .
physical laws tell us that it 's simply impossible .
and in the very same manner , ethical laws tell us what 's morally wrong and what 's right . " yet for many parents in germany , ethics is the only option anyway .

faith groups say that religion is being marginalized in berlin , while supporters of ethics courses say it is essential for an international town like berlin , where different faiths , ethnicities and other groups live side by side , to have a general subject on morals , ethics and values . the initiative " pro-religion " has been campaigning that students should be able to choose between either ethics or religion . fundamental issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam courses are an option along with catholic or protestant ones volker ladenthin , professor of education at bonn university , is in favor of leaving the system the way it is , arguing that ethics is too much of a fundamental issue to be optional . " students are facing highly complex problems in our society , " he said .
" for that they need to know how to approach such problems , how to deal with them , how to make decisions based on values . " he adds that ethics courses are needed to familiarize students with the values that a society is based on , to make them think about and - it is hoped - adopt those values . the ethics course is not limited to one religious confession , and its supporters say that in a multi-cultural and multi-religious society that 's a crucial advantage .
the subject became part of the capital 's core curriculum in 2006 in the wake of a so-called honor killing within berlin 's turkish community , which raised questions about faith and moral values being taught to the younger generation . religion goes further religion as a subject is confession-based , with students segregated according to faith .
father hans langendörfer of the german bishops conference argues that religion as a subject not only covers the ground of ethics but goes much further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's controversy as to whether ethics courses are the better way to instill morals and values " teaching religion is of course not identical with teaching ethics , " he said .
" religion asks questions about god , about meaning , sense and perspective in our lives .
of course that includes many ethical issues but it 's more than simply teaching the values of our society . " the crucial difference he adds is that in ethics , students simply debate what could be done in a given situation or problem .
but religion tells the students what they should do . " the subject of religion gives you an orientation in life , " he says .
" of course that 's linked to ethical values but it actually urges you to fulfill these . " but others insist that ethics is a fundamental issue that only can be complemented but not replaced by religion .
there are no calls that religion as such should vanish from the curriculum – but simply that it should not become mandatory again . professor ladenthin is convinced that ethics is a subject just as important as any of the other traditional core subjects . " it has to be mandatory – just as physics for instance is mandatory , " he says .
" we can not walk on the ceiling or on the wall – even if we may want to .
physical laws tell us that it 's simply impossible .
and in the very same manner , ethical laws tell us what 's morally wrong and what 's right . " yet for many parents in germany , ethics is the only option anyway .
the country is largely secular .
while two-thirds of germans officially belong to a faith , only a fraction of them actually go to church . author : katrin schilling / andreas illmer editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what ’ s the place of religion in the classroom ?
in berlin a referendum will on sunday ask that very question .
currently , the subject of ethics is obligatory and courses in different religious faiths are optional . unlike in most of germany , pupils in the capital berlin do not attend mandatory religion classes . the pupils can however if they decide to opt for extra-curricular lessons in their religious confession .
ethics , on the other hand , is a core subject . the city is divided over the issue .
faith groups say that religion is being marginalized in berlin , while supporters of ethics courses say it is essential for an international town like berlin , where different faiths , ethnicities and other groups live side by side , to have a general subject on morals , ethics and values . the initiative " pro-religion " has been campaigning that students should be able to choose between either ethics or religion . fundamental issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam courses are an option along with catholic or protestant ones volker ladenthin , professor of education at bonn university , is in favor of leaving the system the way it is , arguing that ethics is too much of a fundamental issue to be optional . " students are facing highly complex problems in our society , " he said .
" for that they need to know how to approach such problems , how to deal with them , how to make decisions based on values . " he adds that ethics courses are needed to familiarize students with the values that a society is based on , to make them think about and - it is hoped - adopt those values . the ethics course is not limited to one religious confession , and its supporters say that in a multi-cultural and multi-religious society that 's a crucial advantage .
the subject became part of the capital 's core curriculum in 2006 in the wake of a so-called honor killing within berlin 's turkish community , which raised questions about faith and moral values being taught to the younger generation . religion goes further religion as a subject is confession-based , with students segregated according to faith .
father hans langendörfer of the german bishops conference argues that religion as a subject not only covers the ground of ethics but goes much further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's controversy as to whether ethics courses are the better way to instill morals and values " teaching religion is of course not identical with teaching ethics , " he said .
" religion asks questions about god , about meaning , sense and perspective in our lives .
of course that includes many ethical issues but it 's more than simply teaching the values of our society . " the crucial difference he adds is that in ethics , students simply debate what could be done in a given situation or problem .
but religion tells the students what they should do . " the subject of religion gives you an orientation in life , " he says .
" of course that 's linked to ethical values but it actually urges you to fulfill these . " but others insist that ethics is a fundamental issue that only can be complemented but not replaced by religion .
there are no calls that religion as such should vanish from the curriculum – but simply that it should not become mandatory again . professor ladenthin is convinced that ethics is a subject just as important as any of the other traditional core subjects . " it has to be mandatory – just as physics for instance is mandatory , " he says .
" we can not walk on the ceiling or on the wall – even if we may want to .
physical laws tell us that it 's simply impossible .
and in the very same manner , ethical laws tell us what 's morally wrong and what 's right . " yet for many parents in germany , ethics is the only option anyway .
the country is largely secular .

what ’ s the place of religion in the classroom ?
in berlin a referendum will on sunday ask that very question .
currently , the subject of ethics is obligatory and courses in different religious faiths are optional . unlike in most of germany , pupils in the capital berlin do not attend mandatory religion classes . the pupils can however if they decide to opt for extra-curricular lessons in their religious confession .
ethics , on the other hand , is a core subject . the city is divided over the issue .
faith groups say that religion is being marginalized in berlin , while supporters of ethics courses say it is essential for an international town like berlin , where different faiths , ethnicities and other groups live side by side , to have a general subject on morals , ethics and values . the initiative " pro-religion " has been campaigning that students should be able to choose between either ethics or religion . fundamental issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam courses are an option along with catholic or protestant ones volker ladenthin , professor of education at bonn university , is in favor of leaving the system the way it is , arguing that ethics is too much of a fundamental issue to be optional . " students are facing highly complex problems in our society , " he said .
" for that they need to know how to approach such problems , how to deal with them , how to make decisions based on values . " he adds that ethics courses are needed to familiarize students with the values that a society is based on , to make them think about and - it is hoped - adopt those values . the ethics course is not limited to one religious confession , and its supporters say that in a multi-cultural and multi-religious society that 's a crucial advantage .
the subject became part of the capital 's core curriculum in 2006 in the wake of a so-called honor killing within berlin 's turkish community , which raised questions about faith and moral values being taught to the younger generation . religion goes further religion as a subject is confession-based , with students segregated according to faith .
father hans langendörfer of the german bishops conference argues that religion as a subject not only covers the ground of ethics but goes much further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's controversy as to whether ethics courses are the better way to instill morals and values " teaching religion is of course not identical with teaching ethics , " he said .
" religion asks questions about god , about meaning , sense and perspective in our lives .
of course that includes many ethical issues but it 's more than simply teaching the values of our society . " the crucial difference he adds is that in ethics , students simply debate what could be done in a given situation or problem .
but religion tells the students what they should do . " the subject of religion gives you an orientation in life , " he says .
" of course that 's linked to ethical values but it actually urges you to fulfill these . " but others insist that ethics is a fundamental issue that only can be complemented but not replaced by religion .
there are no calls that religion as such should vanish from the curriculum – but simply that it should not become mandatory again . professor ladenthin is convinced that ethics is a subject just as important as any of the other traditional core subjects . " it has to be mandatory – just as physics for instance is mandatory , " he says .
" we can not walk on the ceiling or on the wall – even if we may want to .
physical laws tell us that it 's simply impossible .
and in the very same manner , ethical laws tell us what 's morally wrong and what 's right . " yet for many parents in germany , ethics is the only option anyway .

what ’ s the place of religion in the classroom ?
in berlin a referendum will on sunday ask that very question .
currently , the subject of ethics is obligatory and courses in different religious faiths are optional . unlike in most of germany , pupils in the capital berlin do not attend mandatory religion classes . the pupils can however if they decide to opt for extra-curricular lessons in their religious confession .
ethics , on the other hand , is a core subject . the city is divided over the issue .
faith groups say that religion is being marginalized in berlin , while supporters of ethics courses say it is essential for an international town like berlin , where different faiths , ethnicities and other groups live side by side , to have a general subject on morals , ethics and values . the initiative " pro-religion " has been campaigning that students should be able to choose between either ethics or religion . fundamental issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam courses are an option along with catholic or protestant ones volker ladenthin , professor of education at bonn university , is in favor of leaving the system the way it is , arguing that ethics is too much of a fundamental issue to be optional . " students are facing highly complex problems in our society , " he said .
" for that they need to know how to approach such problems , how to deal with them , how to make decisions based on values . " he adds that ethics courses are needed to familiarize students with the values that a society is based on , to make them think about and - it is hoped - adopt those values . the ethics course is not limited to one religious confession , and its supporters say that in a multi-cultural and multi-religious society that 's a crucial advantage .
the subject became part of the capital 's core curriculum in 2006 in the wake of a so-called honor killing within berlin 's turkish community , which raised questions about faith and moral values being taught to the younger generation . religion goes further religion as a subject is confession-based , with students segregated according to faith .
father hans langendörfer of the german bishops conference argues that religion as a subject not only covers the ground of ethics but goes much further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's controversy as to whether ethics courses are the better way to instill morals and values " teaching religion is of course not identical with teaching ethics , " he said .
" religion asks questions about god , about meaning , sense and perspective in our lives .
of course that includes many ethical issues but it 's more than simply teaching the values of our society . " the crucial difference he adds is that in ethics , students simply debate what could be done in a given situation or problem .
but religion tells the students what they should do . " the subject of religion gives you an orientation in life , " he says .
" of course that 's linked to ethical values but it actually urges you to fulfill these . " but others insist that ethics is a fundamental issue that only can be complemented but not replaced by religion .
there are no calls that religion as such should vanish from the curriculum – but simply that it should not become mandatory again . professor ladenthin is convinced that ethics is a subject just as important as any of the other traditional core subjects . " it has to be mandatory – just as physics for instance is mandatory , " he says .
" we can not walk on the ceiling or on the wall – even if we may want to .
physical laws tell us that it 's simply impossible .
and in the very same manner , ethical laws tell us what 's morally wrong and what 's right . " yet for many parents in germany , ethics is the only option anyway .
the country is largely secular .

" the plight of the civilians still trapped by the fighting and who remain at extreme risk from the ongoing hostilities is our primary concern , " the eu presidency said in a statement .
" the eu strongly condemns the killings of civilians and calls on all parties to take all necessary action to avoid further civilian casualties .
" the eu condemns in the strongest possible terms the ltte -lrb- liberation tigers of tamil eelam -rrb- for the use of civilians as human shields .
" both the government of sri lanka and the ltte must fully comply with international humanitarian law and ensure the protection of civilians at all times . "
the united nations has estimated that up to 50,000 civilians are caught in the conflict area while the sri lankan government says it is closer 15,000-20,000 .
the tigers insist the real figure is 165,000 .
the eu backed the un secretary general 's decision to send humanitarian chief john holmes to the temporary ceasefire zone saturday , and called on colombo to allow it unhindered access .
the un estimates that as many as 6,500 civilians may have been killed and another 14,000 wounded in the fighting this year , diplomats said .
independent verification of casualty figures is almost impossible as journalists have long been barred from the island 's north , except when under strict supervision on trips organized by the military .

" we call on both sides to stop fighting immediately and allow civilians to safely leave the combat zone , " the white house said in a statement .
the sri lankan government has so far resisted all calls to halt an offensive that is now on the brink of wiping out the ltte , who have been fighting for an independent tamil homeland since 1972 .
the tigers , once one of the most feared guerrilla organizations in the world , have seen their territory shrink to a sliver of land on the northeast coast estimated to measure 10 square kilometers -lrb- about four square miles -rrb- .
the white house specifically demanded an end to any military shelling in a designated " safe zone " and access for aid groups and journalists to civilians who have escaped .
the ltte issued their own call for foreign intervention , warning of " imminent " starvation among civilians and even suggesting that the situation could deteriorate into a crisis as appalling as that in the darfur region of sudan .
white house warns of a future of repercussions the white house statement warned that the government risked sowing the seeds of future ethnic conflict on the sinhalese-majority island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final push to end the tigers resistance has proved particularly bloody " it would compound the current tragedy if the military end of the conflict only breeds further enmity and ends hopes for reconciliation and a unified sri lanka in the future , " the white house said .
around 110,000 civilians managed to get out of the battle zone earlier in the week , overwhelming the government authorities handling relief operations .
the sri lankan government has been blocking most aid agencies from the war-torn north for months , and accuses un agencies and ngos of supporting the tamil tigers .
the un security council president , mexican ambassador claude heller , said the sri lankan government should allow the un and red cross to access all sites where displaced people were being registered and provided with shelter , according to un spokeswoman marie okabe .
despite this , sri lanka 's human rights minister mahinda samarasinghe welcomed the visit by holmes , his second in as many months .

the tigers , once one of the most feared guerrilla organizations in the world , have seen their territory shrink to a sliver of land on the northeast coast estimated to measure 10 square kilometers -lrb- about four square miles -rrb- .
the white house specifically demanded an end to any military shelling in a designated " safe zone " and access for aid groups and journalists to civilians who have escaped .

according to the list , the banks with the worst credit and asset problems include hypo real estate , commerzbank and several state banks . commerzbank 's share of the toxic assets amounts to 101 billion euros , with 49 billion of those coming from the recently acquired dresdner bank .

he said it was " not funny . "
oversight goup bafin has opened an investigation to try to to find out who was behind the leak .
bafin has indicated that the status of some of the toxic assets has changed since the list was compiled .
the sueddeutsche zeitung reported that the information contained in the list dates back to february 26 .

the first involves revaluing the bad assets through a neutral third party , and the other involves collecting the bad assets and giving banks a guarantee against the debt on their balance sheets .
these assets would be backed by the german government , and are reported to be favored by the state banks .
according to a report by the german magazine der spiegel , the state premiers are urgently hoping for results at monday 's meeting .

what ’ s the place of religion in the classroom ?
in berlin a referendum will on sunday ask that very question .
currently , the subject of ethics is obligatory and courses in different religious faiths are optional . unlike in most of germany , pupils in the capital berlin do not attend mandatory religion classes . the pupils can however if they decide to opt for extra-curricular lessons in their religious confession .
ethics , on the other hand , is a core subject . the city is divided over the issue .
faith groups say that religion is being marginalized in berlin , while supporters of ethics courses say it is essential for an international town like berlin , where different faiths , ethnicities and other groups live side by side , to have a general subject on morals , ethics and values . the initiative " pro-religion " has been campaigning that students should be able to choose between either ethics or religion . fundamental issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam courses are an option along with catholic or protestant ones volker ladenthin , professor of education at bonn university , is in favor of leaving the system the way it is , arguing that ethics is too much of a fundamental issue to be optional . " students are facing highly complex problems in our society , " he said .
" for that they need to know how to approach such problems , how to deal with them , how to make decisions based on values . " he adds that ethics courses are needed to familiarize students with the values that a society is based on , to make them think about and - it is hoped - adopt those values . the ethics course is not limited to one religious confession , and its supporters say that in a multi-cultural and multi-religious society that 's a crucial advantage .
the subject became part of the capital 's core curriculum in 2006 in the wake of a so-called honor killing within berlin 's turkish community , which raised questions about faith and moral values being taught to the younger generation . religion goes further religion as a subject is confession-based , with students segregated according to faith .
father hans langendörfer of the german bishops conference argues that religion as a subject not only covers the ground of ethics but goes much further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's controversy as to whether ethics courses are the better way to instill morals and values " teaching religion is of course not identical with teaching ethics , " he said .
" religion asks questions about god , about meaning , sense and perspective in our lives .
of course that includes many ethical issues but it 's more than simply teaching the values of our society . " the crucial difference he adds is that in ethics , students simply debate what could be done in a given situation or problem .
but religion tells the students what they should do . " the subject of religion gives you an orientation in life , " he says .
" of course that 's linked to ethical values but it actually urges you to fulfill these . " but others insist that ethics is a fundamental issue that only can be complemented but not replaced by religion .
there are no calls that religion as such should vanish from the curriculum – but simply that it should not become mandatory again . professor ladenthin is convinced that ethics is a subject just as important as any of the other traditional core subjects . " it has to be mandatory – just as physics for instance is mandatory , " he says .
" we can not walk on the ceiling or on the wall – even if we may want to .
physical laws tell us that it 's simply impossible .
and in the very same manner , ethical laws tell us what 's morally wrong and what 's right . " yet for many parents in germany , ethics is the only option anyway .
the country is largely secular .
while two-thirds of germans officially belong to a faith , only a fraction of them actually go to church . author : katrin schilling / andreas illmer editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the move comes hours after a un security council committee on friday placed three north korean companies on a un blacklist .
the companies stand accused for aiding pyongyang 's missile and nuclear programmes .
north korea was swift to react with announcing to reactivate its nuclear program .
a government spokesperson told the country 's state run news agency that " the reprocessing of spent fuel rods from the pilot atomic power plant began as declared in the foreign ministry statement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yongbyon nuclear center is to get up an running again the development comes after pyongyang walked out of international nuclear disarmament talks earlier this month in a response to a un decision to punish it for a controversial rocket launch .
north korea claims it put a satellite into orbit in what was widely regarded as a disguised long-range missile test .
the un security council regarded the launch as a breach of a un resolution and threatens sanctions .

according to the list , the banks with the worst credit and asset problems include hypo real estate , commerzbank and several state banks . commerzbank 's share of the toxic assets amounts to 101 billion euros , with 49 billion of those coming from the recently acquired dresdner bank .
hypo real estate , which is looking at a likely 90-percent takeover by the german government , has 268 billion euros in toxic assets on its books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal finance minister peer steinbrueck said the leak was " not funny " in a statement given to reuters on saturday , german finance minster peer steinbrueck said that no conclusions can be drawn from the figures in the list .
steinbrueck told reuters that it was “ regrettable " that the list was made public .
he said it was " not funny . "
oversight goup bafin has opened an investigation to try to to find out who was behind the leak .
bafin has indicated that the status of some of the toxic assets has changed since the list was compiled .
the sueddeutsche zeitung reported that the information contained in the list dates back to february 26 .
state banks affected the list names several german state banks among those with the most troubled assets , some 180 billion euros .
steinbrueck is scheduled to meet with german state premiers on monday to discuss the future of the state banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate has some of the highest toxic asset levels among german banks at issue are two potential solutions for the toxic asset crisis .
the first involves revaluing the bad assets through a neutral third party , and the other involves collecting the bad assets and giving banks a guarantee against the debt on their balance sheets .
these assets would be backed by the german government , and are reported to be favored by the state banks .
according to a report by the german magazine der spiegel , the state premiers are urgently hoping for results at monday 's meeting .
however , the government has said it will not likely pass legislation on the so-called " bad bank " solution before the summer , indicating that monday 's meeting is a forum for discussion . mz / jam , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
