chancellor angela merkel has promised tax cuts to secure her party 's re-election , but rivals from left to right are attacking her program as unrealistic . germany 's conservatives have kicked off their election campaign with an explicit appeal to the middle-class .
" we want to relieve the burden on the middle of society , " said christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- general secretary , ronald pofalla , at the opening of the party conference in berlin on monday .
pofalla attacked his party 's main rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , accusing them of pursuing a strategy of " division and envy . "
" we want to reduce taxes , the spd wants to raise them .
we will make this abundantly clear over the next three months , " he said .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu agreed at the weekend that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign .
the main policy would be a modest cut in the lowest income tax bracket from 14 to 12 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier guenther oettinger has called for a rise in sales tax dissent in the ranks but there have been opposing voices among the conservatives .
two cdu state premiers have openly advocated an increase in certain taxes , such as value added tax , to offset the blowout in public expenditures caused by the global economic downturn .
so it was with an eye to the dissenters that chancellor merkel called for party unity when she took to the stage at the party conference , to the drawn-out applause of over 750 party deputies .
" sometimes a bit of lateral thinking is needed , " she said , in a veiled reference to her party 's internal tax-debate , " but we 've thought for long enough . "
merkel vowed , if re-elected , not to raise value added tax during the next term of office , but did n't elaborate on how her tax-cuts would be financed or when they would be introduced .
she also advocated her party 's goal of winning enough votes to ditch the spd as coalition partner in favour of the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we have the power to make our country stronger than it was before .
we have the power to promote growth ... and we say , we can best do this with a different coalition partner , " she said .
criticism from left and right the social democrats ' secretary-general , hubertus heil , said the cdu 's agenda " was not credible . "
he warned that " merkel is either trying to pull the wool over the voter 's eyes , or there really is no sound concept behind the whole thing . "
heil said that the cdu 's election program did not contain ideas on how to shape the country 's future .
with the country 's budget set for a record deficit , any promise to lower taxes was simply " unrealistic . "
criticism also came from the fdp - normally a strong advocate for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy , set to shrink by six percent , will be a key campaign theme the party 's juergen koppelin criticized the plans as " very vague and non-binding " , calling them " spineless " for not including a timetable to introduce the tax cuts .
but fdp leader , guido westerwelle , welcomed the conservatives ' overtures to form a coalition , calling their program a " good basis " for working together .
in contrast , the greens ' claudia roth , also with an eye on possible coalition talks , said the conservatives ' platform was looking " very distant from us . "
the latest opinion poll puts the conservatives on 35 percent of the vote .
right now , that would be just enough to win government with the fdp , who are polling 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left spd , the minority party in merkel 's government , still hopes to retain power in a second grand coalition .
but its goal of forming government with the greens seems increasingly unlikely .
the two parties are currently polling 24 and 15 percent respectively. nw / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.06.2009 merkel makes tax cuts into her pitch for re-election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is personally popular , but her party still only polls 35 percent in 90 days germans elect a new government .
chancellor angela merkel has promised tax cuts to secure her party 's re-election , but rivals from left to right are attacking her program as unrealistic . germany 's conservatives have kicked off their election campaign with an explicit appeal to the middle-class .
" we want to relieve the burden on the middle of society , " said christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- general secretary , ronald pofalla , at the opening of the party conference in berlin on monday .
pofalla attacked his party 's main rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , accusing them of pursuing a strategy of " division and envy . "
" we want to reduce taxes , the spd wants to raise them .
we will make this abundantly clear over the next three months , " he said .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu agreed at the weekend that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign .
the main policy would be a modest cut in the lowest income tax bracket from 14 to 12 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier guenther oettinger has called for a rise in sales tax dissent in the ranks but there have been opposing voices among the conservatives .
two cdu state premiers have openly advocated an increase in certain taxes , such as value added tax , to offset the blowout in public expenditures caused by the global economic downturn .
so it was with an eye to the dissenters that chancellor merkel called for party unity when she took to the stage at the party conference , to the drawn-out applause of over 750 party deputies .
" sometimes a bit of lateral thinking is needed , " she said , in a veiled reference to her party 's internal tax-debate , " but we 've thought for long enough . "
merkel vowed , if re-elected , not to raise value added tax during the next term of office , but did n't elaborate on how her tax-cuts would be financed or when they would be introduced .
she also advocated her party 's goal of winning enough votes to ditch the spd as coalition partner in favour of the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we have the power to make our country stronger than it was before .
we have the power to promote growth ... and we say , we can best do this with a different coalition partner , " she said .
criticism from left and right the social democrats ' secretary-general , hubertus heil , said the cdu 's agenda " was not credible . "
he warned that " merkel is either trying to pull the wool over the voter 's eyes , or there really is no sound concept behind the whole thing . "
heil said that the cdu 's election program did not contain ideas on how to shape the country 's future .
with the country 's budget set for a record deficit , any promise to lower taxes was simply " unrealistic . "

while the central election commission has not made any official announcements , exit polls appear to indicate a win for prime minister sali berisha 's democratic party over the socialists led by edi rama . 24 hours after the polls closed , ballots were still being counted electronically in albania . some 3.1 million albanians were eligible to vote on sunday .
they were casting ballots for 140 legislators , at least 30 percent of whom must be women .
prime minister berisha has been the country 's dominant political figure since the fall of communism fall in 1991 .
the 65-year-old campaigned with promises of quick eu accession and improving the infrastructure and living conditions .
edi rama , mayor of the capital tirana , promised to get rid of what he described as berisha 's nepotist structures in the administration , pledging to do more for albania 's poor .
election day passed without any of the problems that many had feared , although the campaign itself had been marred by violence , including two deaths .
" i ca n't say that these elections were perfect , because no election process is perfect , but these elections were far better than any before . " said berisha once voting had concluded on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berisha is looking for a second term the international election observation mission said the election process showed improvements , but added that violations persist .
hundreds of international observers monitored sunday 's vote to ensure fairness .
vote was orderly , europe 's human rights and security watchdog says the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- monitoring mission chief robert bosch said there were " slight irregularities , " but that they were fewer and less grave than in previous elections .
the european union and the united states have closely watched the vote , which they regard as a test of the tiny country 's readiness for integration with europe . albania joined nato in april , applying the same month to join the european union .
three years ago , tirana took its first step toward eu membership when it signed the stabilisation and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with brussels .
but the southern balkan nation has yet to shrug off the image of a backward , isolated country that it earned during decades under a harsh communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edi rama is popular among younger voters think tank says much is at stake for albania christophe solioz , an expert on the balkans at the geneva-based center for european integration strategies think-tank , told deutsche welle that the eu must renew its political commitment to integrate tirana . in albania , he says , there is a readiness , a political will : “ albania is progressing step-by-step as it overcomes the past culture of corruption and lawlessness .
it is also , step-by-step , meeting the eu benchmarks . the country definitely is on the way ! ”
while solioz estimates that eu membership is at least another ten years away for albania , he says the process must now be clearly defined so the political elite does n't lose hope . a visa-free travel regime for albanians to europe , he says , should be the next step. db / nk / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german company is on the brink of collapse and has said it urgently needs government aid to stay in business . for quelle , there are still hopes that disaster can be avoided .
the head of the company , konrad hilbers , on monday morning urged the government in berlin to decide in favor of the mail-order house and to grant a government loan that would bail the company at least out of its most urgent troubles . " there still is a way to avoid bankruptcy , " he said .
" we need to those discussions and urgently should get some positive results from berlin . " last wednesday , a committee of federal and state finance ministers considered extending quelle up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- worth of loans . the decision on whether or not the loan will be granted is expected to come monday evening after yet another meeting of the inter-ministerial committee . so far , chancellor angela merkel had been rather reluctant to rush to the rescue of quelle , defended her government 's reticence by pointing to the european union 's competition rules . " we have to let the eu in on the whole process , " she said , adding that nobody would benefit if the eu ruled against any state-loans after they had already been made . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer is concerned about the impact of job cuts in his state but the bavarian csu – sister party to merkel ’ s conservative cdu – over the weekend stepped up the pressure on berlin to rule in favor of quelle .
state premier horst seehofer , raised the stakes on sunday , june 28 , accusing his fellow conservatives in the federal government of putting thousands of jobs at risk . " jobs are at acute risk , nobody can want this , " seehofer said . what should be done ? the conservative politician demanded that berlin agree to contribute to a package of loans to save quelle , after it emerged on saturday that the company was unable to pay its suppliers and was teetering on the edge of collapse . bavaria , where most of quelle 's 8,000 employees are located , led the charge , pledging 21 million euros in aid .

" " a state-backed loan might save 8,000 jobs at quelle for now , but it would also endanger the 72,000 jobs at other mail-order companies in germany , " he said . bavaria 's opposition social democrats also criticized the regional government , accusing it of conducting a cynical drama on the backs of quelle employees . on saturday , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that quelle transferred all of its cash to its parent arcandor , only hours before that company declared insolvency on june 9 . an arcandor spokesperson later confirmed the report , but said the transfers were automated and not motivated by the insolvency . since then , quelle has been surviving off the kindness of its suppliers , who have suspended their invoices . nw / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 29.06.2009 exit polls indicate tight race in albanian polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as votes are counted , albania 's ruling party is holding on to its lead in exit polls .
while the central election commission has not made any official announcements , exit polls appear to indicate a win for prime minister sali berisha 's democratic party over the socialists led by edi rama . 24 hours after the polls closed , ballots were still being counted electronically in albania . some 3.1 million albanians were eligible to vote on sunday .
they were casting ballots for 140 legislators , at least 30 percent of whom must be women .
prime minister berisha has been the country 's dominant political figure since the fall of communism fall in 1991 .
the 65-year-old campaigned with promises of quick eu accession and improving the infrastructure and living conditions .
edi rama , mayor of the capital tirana , promised to get rid of what he described as berisha 's nepotist structures in the administration , pledging to do more for albania 's poor .
election day passed without any of the problems that many had feared , although the campaign itself had been marred by violence , including two deaths .
" i ca n't say that these elections were perfect , because no election process is perfect , but these elections were far better than any before . " said berisha once voting had concluded on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berisha is looking for a second term the international election observation mission said the election process showed improvements , but added that violations persist .
hundreds of international observers monitored sunday 's vote to ensure fairness .
vote was orderly , europe 's human rights and security watchdog says the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- monitoring mission chief robert bosch said there were " slight irregularities , " but that they were fewer and less grave than in previous elections .
the european union and the united states have closely watched the vote , which they regard as a test of the tiny country 's readiness for integration with europe . albania joined nato in april , applying the same month to join the european union .
three years ago , tirana took its first step toward eu membership when it signed the stabilisation and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with brussels .
but the southern balkan nation has yet to shrug off the image of a backward , isolated country that it earned during decades under a harsh communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edi rama is popular among younger voters think tank says much is at stake for albania christophe solioz , an expert on the balkans at the geneva-based center for european integration strategies think-tank , told deutsche welle that the eu must renew its political commitment to integrate tirana . in albania , he says , there is a readiness , a political will : “ albania is progressing step-by-step as it overcomes the past culture of corruption and lawlessness .

while the central election commission has not made any official announcements , exit polls appear to indicate a win for prime minister sali berisha 's democratic party over the socialists led by edi rama . 24 hours after the polls closed , ballots were still being counted electronically in albania . some 3.1 million albanians were eligible to vote on sunday .
they were casting ballots for 140 legislators , at least 30 percent of whom must be women .
prime minister berisha has been the country 's dominant political figure since the fall of communism fall in 1991 .
the 65-year-old campaigned with promises of quick eu accession and improving the infrastructure and living conditions .
edi rama , mayor of the capital tirana , promised to get rid of what he described as berisha 's nepotist structures in the administration , pledging to do more for albania 's poor .
election day passed without any of the problems that many had feared , although the campaign itself had been marred by violence , including two deaths .
" i ca n't say that these elections were perfect , because no election process is perfect , but these elections were far better than any before . " said berisha once voting had concluded on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berisha is looking for a second term the international election observation mission said the election process showed improvements , but added that violations persist .
hundreds of international observers monitored sunday 's vote to ensure fairness .
vote was orderly , europe 's human rights and security watchdog says the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- monitoring mission chief robert bosch said there were " slight irregularities , " but that they were fewer and less grave than in previous elections .
the european union and the united states have closely watched the vote , which they regard as a test of the tiny country 's readiness for integration with europe . albania joined nato in april , applying the same month to join the european union .
three years ago , tirana took its first step toward eu membership when it signed the stabilisation and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with brussels .
but the southern balkan nation has yet to shrug off the image of a backward , isolated country that it earned during decades under a harsh communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edi rama is popular among younger voters think tank says much is at stake for albania christophe solioz , an expert on the balkans at the geneva-based center for european integration strategies think-tank , told deutsche welle that the eu must renew its political commitment to integrate tirana . in albania , he says , there is a readiness , a political will : “ albania is progressing step-by-step as it overcomes the past culture of corruption and lawlessness .
it is also , step-by-step , meeting the eu benchmarks . the country definitely is on the way ! ”
while solioz estimates that eu membership is at least another ten years away for albania , he says the process must now be clearly defined so the political elite does n't lose hope . a visa-free travel regime for albanians to europe , he says , should be the next step. db / nk / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the talks , hosted by the european commission , are taking place less than a week before kiev will be expected to hand over three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to russia for gas that it has started to store for the coming winter .
a dispute over payment earlier this year led to russia shutting off gas supplies to ukraine , which affected not only citizens there , but also those living in parts of the european union which depend on gas coming from pipelines running through ukraine .
a quarter of all the natural gas burned within the eu comes from russia , with 80 percent of that flowing through ukraine , mostly to the south-eastern corner of the continent .

however , many organizations , including the imf , are n't convinced that naftogaz is in a position to receive funding .
ceyla pazarbasioglu , head of the imf delegation , told the reuters news agency that they were demanding that the state-owned gas giant undergo some serious reorganization , adding that the company needed to become more transparent and clean up its finances .

the two companies have been arguing for weeks over who will have control after a merger , planned last year when porsche was enjoying a boom in sales , goes through .
over the weekend vw had presented a merger proposition in which it would pay 3 to 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 to 5.6 billion -rrb- for 49.9 percent of porsche ag , which owns the factories and brand .
porsche turned down the deal on monday , with a spokesman for porsche automobil holding se telling journalists it was " not a viable option " , because it would mean that porsche would be required to immediately pay back a 10.75 billion euro credit it had previously gotten from a bank consortium .

the two companies have been arguing for weeks over who will have control after a merger , planned last year when porsche was enjoying a boom in sales , goes through .
over the weekend vw had presented a merger proposition in which it would pay 3 to 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 to 5.6 billion -rrb- for 49.9 percent of porsche ag , which owns the factories and brand .
porsche turned down the deal on monday , with a spokesman for porsche automobil holding se telling journalists it was " not a viable option " , because it would mean that porsche would be required to immediately pay back a 10.75 billion euro credit it had previously gotten from a bank consortium .
porsche se , the family-run owner of the sports carmaker which currently controls 51 percent of volkswagen , racked a debt of 9 billion euros last year through its purchase of vw shares and options .
impatient investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw stocks soared last october when porsche announced it planned to take three-quarters of the automaker 's stock .
the feud has reportedly made the qatar investment authority -lrb- qia -rrb- , which is being wooed by both sides as a potential investor , impatient . according to the german daily handelsblatt , qia was fed up with the battle , and was demanding the two car companies agree " quickly . "
the paper , quoting sources close to the negotiations , said qia had made clear it would not invest in either porsche or volkswagen separately , but would only invest in a merged group .
" qatar does not want to acquire its stake with a crowbar , against the will of volkswagen and lower saxony , " said a source quoted by handelsblatt .
the state of lower saxony owns just over 20 percent of volkswagen .
the premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , has demanded porsche decide , telling reporters that " all the facts are on the table . "
meanwhile , guenther oettinger , premier of the state of baden-wuerttemberg , in which porsche is based , has taken porsche 's side in the debate , despite the fact that his state does not own any shares in the company , saying that vw should be showing more respect to porsche as its majority shareholder. mrm / dpa / ap / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the vatican wants to open the sarcophagus and conduct further tests . the marble coffin in rome 's st. paul 's basilica has never been opened , but , according to tests conducted thus far , the tomb contains pieces of human bone that have been dated to the time of saint paul . pope benedict shared the findings sunday at a service outside the church marking the end of the vatican 's pauline year in honor of the apostle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tomb in st. paul 's basilica has been sealed for some five centuries carbon dating showed that the bone fragments belonged to someone who lived between the first and the second century ad , the pontiff said . " this seems to confirm the unanimous and uncontested tradition that they are the mortal remains of the apostle paul , " added benedict . paul - born saul - had actively persecuted christians , but converted after seeing jesus in a vision while on the road to damascus . he is believed to have been beheaded in the year 67 in rome after years of travel as an early missionary to spread the message of jesus . archeologists collected the bone fragments by inserting a probe through a small hole in the tomb , which is located under the basilica 's main altar . bits of incense , purple linen with gold sequins and blue linen were also found , said the pope . though the findings had been known for more than a year , the vatican waited for benedict to make the official announcement .

the talks , hosted by the european commission , are taking place less than a week before kiev will be expected to hand over three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to russia for gas that it has started to store for the coming winter .
a dispute over payment earlier this year led to russia shutting off gas supplies to ukraine , which affected not only citizens there , but also those living in parts of the european union which depend on gas coming from pipelines running through ukraine .
a quarter of all the natural gas burned within the eu comes from russia , with 80 percent of that flowing through ukraine , mostly to the south-eastern corner of the continent .
transparency an issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is betting on a pipeline across the baltic sea to save itself from these disputes in the future weighed down by the global financial crisis , kiev claims it wo n't be able to come up with the money in time to buy the roughly 20 billion cubic meters of natural gas that it wants , and that has incited the eu to call on the international community to give ukraine a short term loan .
however , many organizations , including the imf , are n't convinced that naftogaz is in a position to receive funding .
ceyla pazarbasioglu , head of the imf delegation , told the reuters news agency that they were demanding that the state-owned gas giant undergo some serious reorganization , adding that the company needed to become more transparent and clean up its finances .
the multibillion euro loan would be part of the imf 's $ 16.4 billion program to help out nations hit hard by the economic crisis. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some military and political concerns remain . the date june 30 , 2009 may just be another in the continuing struggle for normalcy in iraq but it could prove to be one of the most significant of the country 's recent , blighted history .
on that day , us troops pull back from iraqi cities , leaving iraqi forces to take over control for security operations in urban areas .
the americans believe iraq is ready for such a responsibility but unsurprisingly there are concerns . " from a military and security standpoint it 's time for us to move out of the cities , " general ray odierno , the general in charge of us-led coalition forces told cnn on sunday .
" as for the iraqis , i do believe they are ready , " odierno added .
" they 've been working towards this for a long time .
security remains good ; we 've seen constant improvement in the security forces , constant improvement in governance .
i believe this is the time for them to take ultimate responsibility . " us troops have been pulling out of iraq 's cities before tuesday 's deadline as part of a staged withdrawal over the last eight months and " overall stability in iraq remains good , " general odierno said . iraqi parliamentarians show confidence in home army this feeling of optimism is shared by many iraqi parliamentarians .
liberal shiite representative ayad jamaleldin told deutsche welle that despite the continuing fragility of the war-torn country , he was confident that the iraqi armed forces would be able to protect the country 's citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi security forces have the trust of many politicians " of course , the iraqi armed forces are in a position to guarantee the security of the cities , " he said .
" they are even more effective than the multinational troops , because they can identify the different factions faster and better .
in addition , they are more knowledgeable and better suited to deal with geographical factors . " sunni representative shadha al abussi agreed .
" we have much confidence in our own troops , " he told dw .
" i believe , if each citizen could contribute to the control of the situation in iraq , we could record even greater successes . " iraqi security services say they will meet the us withdrawal with their biggest deployment of troops and policemen in the six years since the us-led invasion of the country .
some 120,000 additional soldiers and police will be deployed to baghdad alone , and thousands of others will be deployed to other cities . despite a spasm of violence including bombings that have killed more than 100 people this month alone , us president barack obama and his military are committed to their end-june withdrawal of american troops from iraq 's urban areas as part of a move from a war-like to a diplomatic footing with baghdad . the retreat is in line with last november 's status of forces agreement -lrb- sofa -rrb- , which set out a timetable for a complete us troop withdrawal from iraq by 2011 . us troops to remain " on call " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us forces will operate between cities and on borders nonetheless , analysts said the withdrawal of us combat forces from iraqi cities will be less dramatic than it seems because the military , while less visible , can still intervene if iraqi security forces appeal for help . us forces will " still be conducting significant operations outside of the cities , in the belts of the major cities , and i still believe this will enable us to maintain the current security and stability situation here in iraq , " odierno said . us soldiers will continue to patrol the most conflict-ridden districts of the country outside the cities at the invitation of the iraqi government and patrol borders .
a few will remain in iraqi cities in an advisory capacity . fears over renewed instability in potential power vacuum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear attacks will increase when the us pulls out despite continued us military support , at least for now , the recent bomb attacks and on-going unrest between arab nationalists and kurds in the northern city of mosul have raised concerns about an increase in violence in line with a reduction in us and allied involvement . general odierno blamed the recent attacks on " fractured extremist elements " and suggested that the bombings and unrest were designed to sow the seeds of doubt ahead of the us withdrawal . " they 're trying to use this time frame and this -lrb- pullout -rrb- date to first gain attention for themselves and also to divert attention from the success of the iraqi security forces , " he said , adding that the recent spike in attacks was not a sign of a broader increase of violence across the country . eu involvement in iraq at the mercy of us plans the iraqis and those concerned citizens in regional neighboring countries are not the only ones whose future could be cast into doubt by the partial us pull-out and then its final withdrawal . michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , believes the europeans involved in iraq have much to lose if the us withdrawal leads to an increase in violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's pm nuri al-maliki benefits from eu support " individually , european countries like germany and france have been unwilling to engage in iraq but the eu plays a large , important role in non-direct engagement , " he told deutsche welle .
" the eu is the main financial contributor to un and world bank projects there , it is involved in an energy dialogue and has recently upgraded its technical and co-operation agreement with iraq into a partnership . " the eu knows it can play a strong role in advancing administrative and electoral reforms , " bauer added .
" these are its specific strengths and the eu can help the government through this . " however , bauer said , if the us withdrawal leads to anarchy and civil war , the europeans will be in no position to address the violence . " these latest attacks are attempts by insurgents to stir up new sectarian violence and destabilize the country , " bauer said .
" this was in some ways expected but what is in question is whether the iraqis can govern through this and whether their army can provide protection when the americans go .
if not , all the eu initiatives in iraq will be at risk . " a self-sufficient iraq would welcome more eu aid the us withdrawal could also lead to an increased effort by the eu if stability and security is maintained . " the europeans could step up and play a stronger role by expanding on their specific strengths once the americans are gone , " bauer said .
" this could help iraq 's full transition and also help the stability of the region as the eu has good diplomatic ties with many of the arab states and to a certain degree , iran .
if iraq can govern and protect itself , the eu could become a strong political and diplomatic partner . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this was in some ways expected but what is in question is whether the iraqis can govern through this and whether their army can provide protection when the americans go .
if not , all the eu initiatives in iraq will be at risk .

" they 're trying to use this time frame and this -lrb- pullout -rrb- date to first gain attention for themselves and also to divert attention from the success of the iraqi security forces , " he said , adding that the recent spike in attacks was not a sign of a broader increase of violence across the country . eu involvement in iraq at the mercy of us plans the iraqis and those concerned citizens in regional neighboring countries are not the only ones whose future could be cast into doubt by the partial us pull-out and then its final withdrawal . michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , believes the europeans involved in iraq have much to lose if the us withdrawal leads to an increase in violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's pm nuri al-maliki benefits from eu support " individually , european countries like germany and france have been unwilling to engage in iraq but the eu plays a large , important role in non-direct engagement , " he told deutsche welle .
" the eu is the main financial contributor to un and world bank projects there , it is involved in an energy dialogue and has recently upgraded its technical and co-operation agreement with iraq into a partnership . " the eu knows it can play a strong role in advancing administrative and electoral reforms , " bauer added .
" these are its specific strengths and the eu can help the government through this . " however , bauer said , if the us withdrawal leads to anarchy and civil war , the europeans will be in no position to address the violence . " these latest attacks are attempts by insurgents to stir up new sectarian violence and destabilize the country , " bauer said .
" this was in some ways expected but what is in question is whether the iraqis can govern through this and whether their army can provide protection when the americans go .
if not , all the eu initiatives in iraq will be at risk . " a self-sufficient iraq would welcome more eu aid the us withdrawal could also lead to an increased effort by the eu if stability and security is maintained . " the europeans could step up and play a stronger role by expanding on their specific strengths once the americans are gone , " bauer said .
" this could help iraq 's full transition and also help the stability of the region as the eu has good diplomatic ties with many of the arab states and to a certain degree , iran .
if iraq can govern and protect itself , the eu could become a strong political and diplomatic partner . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first batch of handsets that are n't tied to a particular charging device should hit the market in 2010 . europe 's avid mobile phone-users will soon be able to empty their drawers of the familiar tangle of chargers after leading manufacturers agreed on an industry standard . major mobile manufacturers , including apple , lg , motorola , nokia , samsung , sony ericsson und texas instruments , signed a deal on monday agreeing to a standard charger for all the cell phones they produce , the european commission said . a single , standard charger will cut costs to manufacturers and reduce the number of chargers thrown away when consumers buy new phones , eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said , adding that he wanted to see the common charger expanded to include other older phones , cameras and laptops in the years ahead . " i am very pleased that industry has found an agreement , which will make life much simpler for consumers , " verheugen said .
the commissioner had threatened to pass legislation on the issue if the industry failed to come up with a voluntary deal . non-binding agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older phones wo n't be covered by the new agreement phone-makers decided to use the currently available micro-usb plug for the mobiles they produce in the future .
the deal also means the creation of an eu norm for new mobile phones . manufacturers originally developed different chargers to match their batteries , since those that were not charged correctly run the risk of exploding . the mobile industry said the number of chargers produced every year could be cut in half when the new agreement goes into effect .
it is estimated that tons of trash pile into landfills every year as consumers throw away chargers when switching cell phones . the eu represents the world 's biggest market for mobile phones , with between 350 and 400 million currently in operation and some 185 million new ones sold each year . monday 's agreement is , however , not legally binding . sms / dpa / ap / retuers editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the vatican wants to open the sarcophagus and conduct further tests . the marble coffin in rome 's st. paul 's basilica has never been opened , but , according to tests conducted thus far , the tomb contains pieces of human bone that have been dated to the time of saint paul . pope benedict shared the findings sunday at a service outside the church marking the end of the vatican 's pauline year in honor of the apostle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tomb in st. paul 's basilica has been sealed for some five centuries carbon dating showed that the bone fragments belonged to someone who lived between the first and the second century ad , the pontiff said . " this seems to confirm the unanimous and uncontested tradition that they are the mortal remains of the apostle paul , " added benedict . paul - born saul - had actively persecuted christians , but converted after seeing jesus in a vision while on the road to damascus . he is believed to have been beheaded in the year 67 in rome after years of travel as an early missionary to spread the message of jesus . archeologists collected the bone fragments by inserting a probe through a small hole in the tomb , which is located under the basilica 's main altar . bits of incense , purple linen with gold sequins and blue linen were also found , said the pope . though the findings had been known for more than a year , the vatican waited for benedict to make the official announcement .
he is likely to approve further tests and the opening of the tomb . kjb / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.06.2009 merkel makes tax cuts into her pitch for re-election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is personally popular , but her party still only polls 35 percent in 90 days germans elect a new government .
chancellor angela merkel has promised tax cuts to secure her party 's re-election , but rivals from left to right are attacking her program as unrealistic . germany 's conservatives have kicked off their election campaign with an explicit appeal to the middle-class .
" we want to relieve the burden on the middle of society , " said christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- general secretary , ronald pofalla , at the opening of the party conference in berlin on monday .
pofalla attacked his party 's main rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , accusing them of pursuing a strategy of " division and envy . "
" we want to reduce taxes , the spd wants to raise them .
we will make this abundantly clear over the next three months , " he said .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu agreed at the weekend that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign .
the main policy would be a modest cut in the lowest income tax bracket from 14 to 12 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier guenther oettinger has called for a rise in sales tax dissent in the ranks but there have been opposing voices among the conservatives .
two cdu state premiers have openly advocated an increase in certain taxes , such as value added tax , to offset the blowout in public expenditures caused by the global economic downturn .
so it was with an eye to the dissenters that chancellor merkel called for party unity when she took to the stage at the party conference , to the drawn-out applause of over 750 party deputies .
" sometimes a bit of lateral thinking is needed , " she said , in a veiled reference to her party 's internal tax-debate , " but we 've thought for long enough . "
merkel vowed , if re-elected , not to raise value added tax during the next term of office , but did n't elaborate on how her tax-cuts would be financed or when they would be introduced .
she also advocated her party 's goal of winning enough votes to ditch the spd as coalition partner in favour of the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we have the power to make our country stronger than it was before .
we have the power to promote growth ... and we say , we can best do this with a different coalition partner , " she said .
criticism from left and right the social democrats ' secretary-general , hubertus heil , said the cdu 's agenda " was not credible . "
he warned that " merkel is either trying to pull the wool over the voter 's eyes , or there really is no sound concept behind the whole thing . "
heil said that the cdu 's election program did not contain ideas on how to shape the country 's future .
with the country 's budget set for a record deficit , any promise to lower taxes was simply " unrealistic . "
criticism also came from the fdp - normally a strong advocate for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy , set to shrink by six percent , will be a key campaign theme the party 's juergen koppelin criticized the plans as " very vague and non-binding " , calling them " spineless " for not including a timetable to introduce the tax cuts .
but fdp leader , guido westerwelle , welcomed the conservatives ' overtures to form a coalition , calling their program a " good basis " for working together .
in contrast , the greens ' claudia roth , also with an eye on possible coalition talks , said the conservatives ' platform was looking " very distant from us . "
the latest opinion poll puts the conservatives on 35 percent of the vote .
right now , that would be just enough to win government with the fdp , who are polling 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left spd , the minority party in merkel 's government , still hopes to retain power in a second grand coalition .
but its goal of forming government with the greens seems increasingly unlikely .
the two parties are currently polling 24 and 15 percent respectively. nw / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 29.06.2009 porsche turns down vw terms for merger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two german automakers have been arguing over the merger since last year porsche has rejected a rescue bid from volkswagen as it tries to stay afloat following its daring plan to take over vw amid the global recession . german sportscar maker porsche has rejected an offer from mass automaker volkswagen -lrb- vw -rrb- to take a 49 percent stake in the company , saying it would breach the terms of its credit arrangement with banks .
the two companies have been arguing for weeks over who will have control after a merger , planned last year when porsche was enjoying a boom in sales , goes through .
over the weekend vw had presented a merger proposition in which it would pay 3 to 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 to 5.6 billion -rrb- for 49.9 percent of porsche ag , which owns the factories and brand .
porsche turned down the deal on monday , with a spokesman for porsche automobil holding se telling journalists it was " not a viable option " , because it would mean that porsche would be required to immediately pay back a 10.75 billion euro credit it had previously gotten from a bank consortium .
porsche se , the family-run owner of the sports carmaker which currently controls 51 percent of volkswagen , racked a debt of 9 billion euros last year through its purchase of vw shares and options .
impatient investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw stocks soared last october when porsche announced it planned to take three-quarters of the automaker 's stock .
the feud has reportedly made the qatar investment authority -lrb- qia -rrb- , which is being wooed by both sides as a potential investor , impatient . according to the german daily handelsblatt , qia was fed up with the battle , and was demanding the two car companies agree " quickly . "
the paper , quoting sources close to the negotiations , said qia had made clear it would not invest in either porsche or volkswagen separately , but would only invest in a merged group .
" qatar does not want to acquire its stake with a crowbar , against the will of volkswagen and lower saxony , " said a source quoted by handelsblatt .
the state of lower saxony owns just over 20 percent of volkswagen .
the premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , has demanded porsche decide , telling reporters that " all the facts are on the table . "
meanwhile , guenther oettinger , premier of the state of baden-wuerttemberg , in which porsche is based , has taken porsche 's side in the debate , despite the fact that his state does not own any shares in the company , saying that vw should be showing more respect to porsche as its majority shareholder. mrm / dpa / ap / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de porsche refuses vw 's ultimatum germany 's financially troubled sports car maker porsche has rejected what it calls a humiliating ultimatum from rival volkswagen , but the corporate power struggle between the two companies is anything but over .
-lrb- 27.06.2009 -rrb- snubbed by german government , porsche looks elsewhere for help with germany 's state-owned kfw bank increasingly unlikely to come to the rescue of porsche , the ailing car maker has reportedly entered talks with rival daimler and the gulf state of qatar in an attempt to win investors .

always active in the midfield and constantly pushing the offensive , the bremen player extended germany 's lead in the 48th minute with a stunning free kick from 35 metres .
second league striker sandro wagner rounded off germany 's impressive victory towards the end of the second half with a double . germany 's golden generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach horst hrubesch changed his tactics against england " we did everything right and the team deserves great praise .
it was simply fun to watch , " said hrubesch , who was european champion with germany in 1980 .
germany had already faced england coached by stuart pearce in the group phase without achieving more than a meagre 1:1 .
but hrubesch changed his tactics for the finals switching from a 4-4-2 formation to 4-1-4-1 with the duisburg player wagner as sole striker .
" we implemented everything our coach had told us and this made life easy for us , " said ozil , the man of the match .
however , though the result appears crushing , england did have chances with lee cattermole hitting the crossbar in the 58th minute .
winger adam johnson ran on to a ball by james milner and almost flicked the ball into the net with his heel but german defender andreas beck stopped it on the goal line . monday 's victory in the u21 competition gives germany the junior triple after the u17 and u19 teams also took the soccer crowns in their respective european competitions . nk / dpa / ap / reuters / sid / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the central election commission has not made any official announcements , exit polls appear to indicate a win for prime minister sali berisha 's democratic party over the socialists led by edi rama . 24 hours after the polls closed , ballots were still being counted electronically in albania . some 3.1 million albanians were eligible to vote on sunday .
they were casting ballots for 140 legislators , at least 30 percent of whom must be women .
prime minister berisha has been the country 's dominant political figure since the fall of communism fall in 1991 .
the 65-year-old campaigned with promises of quick eu accession and improving the infrastructure and living conditions .
edi rama , mayor of the capital tirana , promised to get rid of what he described as berisha 's nepotist structures in the administration , pledging to do more for albania 's poor .
election day passed without any of the problems that many had feared , although the campaign itself had been marred by violence , including two deaths .
" i ca n't say that these elections were perfect , because no election process is perfect , but these elections were far better than any before . " said berisha once voting had concluded on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berisha is looking for a second term the international election observation mission said the election process showed improvements , but added that violations persist .
hundreds of international observers monitored sunday 's vote to ensure fairness .
vote was orderly , europe 's human rights and security watchdog says the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- monitoring mission chief robert bosch said there were " slight irregularities , " but that they were fewer and less grave than in previous elections .
the european union and the united states have closely watched the vote , which they regard as a test of the tiny country 's readiness for integration with europe . albania joined nato in april , applying the same month to join the european union .
three years ago , tirana took its first step toward eu membership when it signed the stabilisation and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with brussels .
but the southern balkan nation has yet to shrug off the image of a backward , isolated country that it earned during decades under a harsh communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edi rama is popular among younger voters think tank says much is at stake for albania christophe solioz , an expert on the balkans at the geneva-based center for european integration strategies think-tank , told deutsche welle that the eu must renew its political commitment to integrate tirana . in albania , he says , there is a readiness , a political will : “ albania is progressing step-by-step as it overcomes the past culture of corruption and lawlessness .
it is also , step-by-step , meeting the eu benchmarks . the country definitely is on the way ! ”
while solioz estimates that eu membership is at least another ten years away for albania , he says the process must now be clearly defined so the political elite does n't lose hope . a visa-free travel regime for albanians to europe , he says , should be the next step. db / nk / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.06.2009 merkel makes tax cuts into her pitch for re-election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is personally popular , but her party still only polls 35 percent in 90 days germans elect a new government .
chancellor angela merkel has promised tax cuts to secure her party 's re-election , but rivals from left to right are attacking her program as unrealistic . germany 's conservatives have kicked off their election campaign with an explicit appeal to the middle-class .
" we want to relieve the burden on the middle of society , " said christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- general secretary , ronald pofalla , at the opening of the party conference in berlin on monday .
pofalla attacked his party 's main rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , accusing them of pursuing a strategy of " division and envy . "
" we want to reduce taxes , the spd wants to raise them .
we will make this abundantly clear over the next three months , " he said .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu agreed at the weekend that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign .
the main policy would be a modest cut in the lowest income tax bracket from 14 to 12 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier guenther oettinger has called for a rise in sales tax dissent in the ranks but there have been opposing voices among the conservatives .
two cdu state premiers have openly advocated an increase in certain taxes , such as value added tax , to offset the blowout in public expenditures caused by the global economic downturn .
so it was with an eye to the dissenters that chancellor merkel called for party unity when she took to the stage at the party conference , to the drawn-out applause of over 750 party deputies .
" sometimes a bit of lateral thinking is needed , " she said , in a veiled reference to her party 's internal tax-debate , " but we 've thought for long enough . "
merkel vowed , if re-elected , not to raise value added tax during the next term of office , but did n't elaborate on how her tax-cuts would be financed or when they would be introduced .
she also advocated her party 's goal of winning enough votes to ditch the spd as coalition partner in favour of the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we have the power to make our country stronger than it was before .
we have the power to promote growth ... and we say , we can best do this with a different coalition partner , " she said .
criticism from left and right the social democrats ' secretary-general , hubertus heil , said the cdu 's agenda " was not credible . "
he warned that " merkel is either trying to pull the wool over the voter 's eyes , or there really is no sound concept behind the whole thing . "
heil said that the cdu 's election program did not contain ideas on how to shape the country 's future .
with the country 's budget set for a record deficit , any promise to lower taxes was simply " unrealistic . "
criticism also came from the fdp - normally a strong advocate for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy , set to shrink by six percent , will be a key campaign theme the party 's juergen koppelin criticized the plans as " very vague and non-binding " , calling them " spineless " for not including a timetable to introduce the tax cuts .
but fdp leader , guido westerwelle , welcomed the conservatives ' overtures to form a coalition , calling their program a " good basis " for working together .
in contrast , the greens ' claudia roth , also with an eye on possible coalition talks , said the conservatives ' platform was looking " very distant from us . "
the latest opinion poll puts the conservatives on 35 percent of the vote .
right now , that would be just enough to win government with the fdp , who are polling 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left spd , the minority party in merkel 's government , still hopes to retain power in a second grand coalition .
but its goal of forming government with the greens seems increasingly unlikely .
the two parties are currently polling 24 and 15 percent respectively. nw / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel has promised tax cuts to secure her party 's re-election , but rivals from left to right are attacking her program as unrealistic . germany 's conservatives have kicked off their election campaign with an explicit appeal to the middle-class .
" we want to relieve the burden on the middle of society , " said christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- general secretary , ronald pofalla , at the opening of the party conference in berlin on monday .
pofalla attacked his party 's main rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , accusing them of pursuing a strategy of " division and envy . "
" we want to reduce taxes , the spd wants to raise them .
we will make this abundantly clear over the next three months , " he said .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu agreed at the weekend that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign .
the main policy would be a modest cut in the lowest income tax bracket from 14 to 12 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier guenther oettinger has called for a rise in sales tax dissent in the ranks but there have been opposing voices among the conservatives .
two cdu state premiers have openly advocated an increase in certain taxes , such as value added tax , to offset the blowout in public expenditures caused by the global economic downturn .
so it was with an eye to the dissenters that chancellor merkel called for party unity when she took to the stage at the party conference , to the drawn-out applause of over 750 party deputies .
" sometimes a bit of lateral thinking is needed , " she said , in a veiled reference to her party 's internal tax-debate , " but we 've thought for long enough . "
merkel vowed , if re-elected , not to raise value added tax during the next term of office , but did n't elaborate on how her tax-cuts would be financed or when they would be introduced .
she also advocated her party 's goal of winning enough votes to ditch the spd as coalition partner in favour of the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we have the power to make our country stronger than it was before .
we have the power to promote growth ... and we say , we can best do this with a different coalition partner , " she said .
criticism from left and right the social democrats ' secretary-general , hubertus heil , said the cdu 's agenda " was not credible . "
he warned that " merkel is either trying to pull the wool over the voter 's eyes , or there really is no sound concept behind the whole thing . "
heil said that the cdu 's election program did not contain ideas on how to shape the country 's future .
with the country 's budget set for a record deficit , any promise to lower taxes was simply " unrealistic . "
criticism also came from the fdp - normally a strong advocate for tax cuts .

now the vatican wants to open the sarcophagus and conduct further tests . the marble coffin in rome 's st. paul 's basilica has never been opened , but , according to tests conducted thus far , the tomb contains pieces of human bone that have been dated to the time of saint paul . pope benedict shared the findings sunday at a service outside the church marking the end of the vatican 's pauline year in honor of the apostle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tomb in st. paul 's basilica has been sealed for some five centuries carbon dating showed that the bone fragments belonged to someone who lived between the first and the second century ad , the pontiff said . " this seems to confirm the unanimous and uncontested tradition that they are the mortal remains of the apostle paul , " added benedict . paul - born saul - had actively persecuted christians , but converted after seeing jesus in a vision while on the road to damascus . he is believed to have been beheaded in the year 67 in rome after years of travel as an early missionary to spread the message of jesus . archeologists collected the bone fragments by inserting a probe through a small hole in the tomb , which is located under the basilica 's main altar . bits of incense , purple linen with gold sequins and blue linen were also found , said the pope . though the findings had been known for more than a year , the vatican waited for benedict to make the official announcement .

the talks , hosted by the european commission , are taking place less than a week before kiev will be expected to hand over three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to russia for gas that it has started to store for the coming winter .
a dispute over payment earlier this year led to russia shutting off gas supplies to ukraine , which affected not only citizens there , but also those living in parts of the european union which depend on gas coming from pipelines running through ukraine .

however , many organizations , including the imf , are n't convinced that naftogaz is in a position to receive funding .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 29.06.2009 in caucasus , eu monitors must deal with tensions alone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are warning of volatility in the separatist regions in the conflict-prone caucasus , concern is mounting about a security vacuum following the end of the un and osce 's observer missions .
just 200 eu monitors are left , and they 're facing a volatile situation . territorial tensions in the caucasus have a long and tangled history , but since the break-up of the soviet union , russia and georgia have been repeatedly at odds over the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's not surprising , then , that several international observer and military missions have been active in the region . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has had a mission in georgia since 1992 to promote negotiations between conflicting parties and reach a peaceful political settlement .
in 1993 , the united nations created unomig , a military observer mission to verify compliance with a 1993 ceasefire agreement between georgian and abkhaz authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce 's mandate expires on june 30 tensions again came to a head in august 2008 when georgia launched a short but bloody attack on south ossetia .
russia , which has long supported the province 's claims to independence , responded by pouring thousands of troops into south ossetia .
georgian troops were forced out of south ossetia and abkhazia in a matter of days , with russian troops also occupying parts of georgia . under the ceasefire brokered with the help of then-eu president nicolas sarkozy , russia agreed to pull its troops back into south ossetia and abkhazia , but was repeatedly accused by western nations of failing to abide by the truce deal .
adding fuel to the fire , russia officially recognized the independence of the breakaway provinces , a move strongly condemned by the west , which maintains that the provinces are part of georgia . osce mandate expires june 30 as a result , the european union sent a team of 200 observers to georgia to monitor compliance with the six-point ceasefire agreement .
their one-year mandate began on oct.1 , 2008 . the eu monitors had been working in close cooperation with the osce and un missions , but now , the situation has changed dramatically . bildunterschrift : the osce 's main mission to georgia expired at the end of 2008 , but the organization continued to be represented by 20 unarmed military monitors on a mandate that expires on june 30 .
russia has scuppered negotiations on extending their mandate , and has denied them access to south ossetia since the war . earlier this month , russia also vetoed the extension of the un mission in georgia .
the un team had been monitoring the ceasefire along the border between georgia and abkhazia since the end of the war . un mission head johan verbeke said russia 's veto would undermine stability in abkhazia , leaving some 60,000 ethnic georgians there unprotected . " we 've contributed to ensuring that the population in abkhazia had a secure environment in which to operate , " verbeke told deutsche welle .
" i think this mission did effectively contribute to peace and security . " veil of secrecy now , that hard-won security is at stake .
with the departure of the osce and un observers , the eu has been left alone with around 200 monitors , who are unable to enter either south ossetia or abkhazia . " in sum , russia has blinded the international community to what it is doing in the occupied georgian territories , " david j. smith , director of the georgian security analysis center wrote on georgiandaily.com , an independent english-language website based in new york .
" behind its veil of secrecy , russia can continue to strengthen military logistics , perhaps preparing another armed attack on the rest of georgia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is concerned about russia 's activities in south ossetia in a recent briefing , the international crisis group , a brussels-based think tank , also expressed its view that " the lack of an effective security regime in and around the conflict zones of south ossetia and abkhazia create a dangerous atmosphere in which extensive fighting could again erupt . " crisis group called on russia to " re-engage fully in discussions with the security council " in order to move past its june 15 veto and find a continued role for the un in georgia .
it also called on the eu and other international organizations to invest the eu mission with an expanded role to address the situation on the ground . the head of the eu mission , joerg haber , is nonetheless confident that his team will be able to carry out its task of furthering stability in the region and patrolling the border to south ossetia , despite the loss of the osce and un observers . " we have enough people and vehicles to patrol the area and continue our work , " haber told deutsche welle .
" our mandate is not the same as those of the osce and the un .

just 200 eu monitors are left , and they 're facing a volatile situation . territorial tensions in the caucasus have a long and tangled history , but since the break-up of the soviet union , russia and georgia have been repeatedly at odds over the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's not surprising , then , that several international observer and military missions have been active in the region . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has had a mission in georgia since 1992 to promote negotiations between conflicting parties and reach a peaceful political settlement .
in 1993 , the united nations created unomig , a military observer mission to verify compliance with a 1993 ceasefire agreement between georgian and abkhaz authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce 's mandate expires on june 30 tensions again came to a head in august 2008 when georgia launched a short but bloody attack on south ossetia .
russia , which has long supported the province 's claims to independence , responded by pouring thousands of troops into south ossetia .
georgian troops were forced out of south ossetia and abkhazia in a matter of days , with russian troops also occupying parts of georgia . under the ceasefire brokered with the help of then-eu president nicolas sarkozy , russia agreed to pull its troops back into south ossetia and abkhazia , but was repeatedly accused by western nations of failing to abide by the truce deal .
adding fuel to the fire , russia officially recognized the independence of the breakaway provinces , a move strongly condemned by the west , which maintains that the provinces are part of georgia . osce mandate expires june 30 as a result , the european union sent a team of 200 observers to georgia to monitor compliance with the six-point ceasefire agreement .
their one-year mandate began on oct.1 , 2008 . the eu monitors had been working in close cooperation with the osce and un missions , but now , the situation has changed dramatically . bildunterschrift : the osce 's main mission to georgia expired at the end of 2008 , but the organization continued to be represented by 20 unarmed military monitors on a mandate that expires on june 30 .
russia has scuppered negotiations on extending their mandate , and has denied them access to south ossetia since the war . earlier this month , russia also vetoed the extension of the un mission in georgia .
the un team had been monitoring the ceasefire along the border between georgia and abkhazia since the end of the war . un mission head johan verbeke said russia 's veto would undermine stability in abkhazia , leaving some 60,000 ethnic georgians there unprotected . " we 've contributed to ensuring that the population in abkhazia had a secure environment in which to operate , " verbeke told deutsche welle .
" i think this mission did effectively contribute to peace and security . " veil of secrecy now , that hard-won security is at stake .
with the departure of the osce and un observers , the eu has been left alone with around 200 monitors , who are unable to enter either south ossetia or abkhazia . " in sum , russia has blinded the international community to what it is doing in the occupied georgian territories , " david j. smith , director of the georgian security analysis center wrote on georgiandaily.com , an independent english-language website based in new york .
" behind its veil of secrecy , russia can continue to strengthen military logistics , perhaps preparing another armed attack on the rest of georgia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is concerned about russia 's activities in south ossetia in a recent briefing , the international crisis group , a brussels-based think tank , also expressed its view that " the lack of an effective security regime in and around the conflict zones of south ossetia and abkhazia create a dangerous atmosphere in which extensive fighting could again erupt . " crisis group called on russia to " re-engage fully in discussions with the security council " in order to move past its june 15 veto and find a continued role for the un in georgia .
it also called on the eu and other international organizations to invest the eu mission with an expanded role to address the situation on the ground . the head of the eu mission , joerg haber , is nonetheless confident that his team will be able to carry out its task of furthering stability in the region and patrolling the border to south ossetia , despite the loss of the osce and un observers . " we have enough people and vehicles to patrol the area and continue our work , " haber told deutsche welle .
" our mandate is not the same as those of the osce and the un .
the osce had broader powers than us , and the un mission was mainly a mission of military observers .

but some military and political concerns remain . the date june 30 , 2009 may just be another in the continuing struggle for normalcy in iraq but it could prove to be one of the most significant of the country 's recent , blighted history .
on that day , us troops pull back from iraqi cities , leaving iraqi forces to take over control for security operations in urban areas .
the americans believe iraq is ready for such a responsibility but unsurprisingly there are concerns . " from a military and security standpoint it 's time for us to move out of the cities , " general ray odierno , the general in charge of us-led coalition forces told cnn on sunday .
" as for the iraqis , i do believe they are ready , " odierno added .
" they 've been working towards this for a long time .
security remains good ; we 've seen constant improvement in the security forces , constant improvement in governance .
i believe this is the time for them to take ultimate responsibility . " us troops have been pulling out of iraq 's cities before tuesday 's deadline as part of a staged withdrawal over the last eight months and " overall stability in iraq remains good , " general odierno said . iraqi parliamentarians show confidence in home army this feeling of optimism is shared by many iraqi parliamentarians .
liberal shiite representative ayad jamaleldin told deutsche welle that despite the continuing fragility of the war-torn country , he was confident that the iraqi armed forces would be able to protect the country 's citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi security forces have the trust of many politicians " of course , the iraqi armed forces are in a position to guarantee the security of the cities , " he said .
" they are even more effective than the multinational troops , because they can identify the different factions faster and better .
in addition , they are more knowledgeable and better suited to deal with geographical factors . " sunni representative shadha al abussi agreed .
" we have much confidence in our own troops , " he told dw .
" i believe , if each citizen could contribute to the control of the situation in iraq , we could record even greater successes . " iraqi security services say they will meet the us withdrawal with their biggest deployment of troops and policemen in the six years since the us-led invasion of the country .
some 120,000 additional soldiers and police will be deployed to baghdad alone , and thousands of others will be deployed to other cities . despite a spasm of violence including bombings that have killed more than 100 people this month alone , us president barack obama and his military are committed to their end-june withdrawal of american troops from iraq 's urban areas as part of a move from a war-like to a diplomatic footing with baghdad . the retreat is in line with last november 's status of forces agreement -lrb- sofa -rrb- , which set out a timetable for a complete us troop withdrawal from iraq by 2011 . us troops to remain " on call " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us forces will operate between cities and on borders nonetheless , analysts said the withdrawal of us combat forces from iraqi cities will be less dramatic than it seems because the military , while less visible , can still intervene if iraqi security forces appeal for help . us forces will " still be conducting significant operations outside of the cities , in the belts of the major cities , and i still believe this will enable us to maintain the current security and stability situation here in iraq , " odierno said . us soldiers will continue to patrol the most conflict-ridden districts of the country outside the cities at the invitation of the iraqi government and patrol borders .
a few will remain in iraqi cities in an advisory capacity . fears over renewed instability in potential power vacuum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear attacks will increase when the us pulls out despite continued us military support , at least for now , the recent bomb attacks and on-going unrest between arab nationalists and kurds in the northern city of mosul have raised concerns about an increase in violence in line with a reduction in us and allied involvement . general odierno blamed the recent attacks on " fractured extremist elements " and suggested that the bombings and unrest were designed to sow the seeds of doubt ahead of the us withdrawal . " they 're trying to use this time frame and this -lrb- pullout -rrb- date to first gain attention for themselves and also to divert attention from the success of the iraqi security forces , " he said , adding that the recent spike in attacks was not a sign of a broader increase of violence across the country . eu involvement in iraq at the mercy of us plans the iraqis and those concerned citizens in regional neighboring countries are not the only ones whose future could be cast into doubt by the partial us pull-out and then its final withdrawal . michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , believes the europeans involved in iraq have much to lose if the us withdrawal leads to an increase in violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's pm nuri al-maliki benefits from eu support " individually , european countries like germany and france have been unwilling to engage in iraq but the eu plays a large , important role in non-direct engagement , " he told deutsche welle .
" the eu is the main financial contributor to un and world bank projects there , it is involved in an energy dialogue and has recently upgraded its technical and co-operation agreement with iraq into a partnership . " the eu knows it can play a strong role in advancing administrative and electoral reforms , " bauer added .
" these are its specific strengths and the eu can help the government through this . " however , bauer said , if the us withdrawal leads to anarchy and civil war , the europeans will be in no position to address the violence . " these latest attacks are attempts by insurgents to stir up new sectarian violence and destabilize the country , " bauer said .
" this was in some ways expected but what is in question is whether the iraqis can govern through this and whether their army can provide protection when the americans go .
if not , all the eu initiatives in iraq will be at risk . " a self-sufficient iraq would welcome more eu aid the us withdrawal could also lead to an increased effort by the eu if stability and security is maintained . " the europeans could step up and play a stronger role by expanding on their specific strengths once the americans are gone , " bauer said .
" this could help iraq 's full transition and also help the stability of the region as the eu has good diplomatic ties with many of the arab states and to a certain degree , iran .
if iraq can govern and protect itself , the eu could become a strong political and diplomatic partner . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some military and political concerns remain . the date june 30 , 2009 may just be another in the continuing struggle for normalcy in iraq but it could prove to be one of the most significant of the country 's recent , blighted history .
on that day , us troops pull back from iraqi cities , leaving iraqi forces to take over control for security operations in urban areas .
the americans believe iraq is ready for such a responsibility but unsurprisingly there are concerns . " from a military and security standpoint it 's time for us to move out of the cities , " general ray odierno , the general in charge of us-led coalition forces told cnn on sunday .
" as for the iraqis , i do believe they are ready , " odierno added .
" they 've been working towards this for a long time .
security remains good ; we 've seen constant improvement in the security forces , constant improvement in governance .
i believe this is the time for them to take ultimate responsibility . " us troops have been pulling out of iraq 's cities before tuesday 's deadline as part of a staged withdrawal over the last eight months and " overall stability in iraq remains good , " general odierno said . iraqi parliamentarians show confidence in home army this feeling of optimism is shared by many iraqi parliamentarians .
liberal shiite representative ayad jamaleldin told deutsche welle that despite the continuing fragility of the war-torn country , he was confident that the iraqi armed forces would be able to protect the country 's citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi security forces have the trust of many politicians " of course , the iraqi armed forces are in a position to guarantee the security of the cities , " he said .
" they are even more effective than the multinational troops , because they can identify the different factions faster and better .
in addition , they are more knowledgeable and better suited to deal with geographical factors . " sunni representative shadha al abussi agreed .
" we have much confidence in our own troops , " he told dw .
" i believe , if each citizen could contribute to the control of the situation in iraq , we could record even greater successes . " iraqi security services say they will meet the us withdrawal with their biggest deployment of troops and policemen in the six years since the us-led invasion of the country .
some 120,000 additional soldiers and police will be deployed to baghdad alone , and thousands of others will be deployed to other cities . despite a spasm of violence including bombings that have killed more than 100 people this month alone , us president barack obama and his military are committed to their end-june withdrawal of american troops from iraq 's urban areas as part of a move from a war-like to a diplomatic footing with baghdad . the retreat is in line with last november 's status of forces agreement -lrb- sofa -rrb- , which set out a timetable for a complete us troop withdrawal from iraq by 2011 . us troops to remain " on call " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us forces will operate between cities and on borders nonetheless , analysts said the withdrawal of us combat forces from iraqi cities will be less dramatic than it seems because the military , while less visible , can still intervene if iraqi security forces appeal for help . us forces will " still be conducting significant operations outside of the cities , in the belts of the major cities , and i still believe this will enable us to maintain the current security and stability situation here in iraq , " odierno said . us soldiers will continue to patrol the most conflict-ridden districts of the country outside the cities at the invitation of the iraqi government and patrol borders .
a few will remain in iraqi cities in an advisory capacity . fears over renewed instability in potential power vacuum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear attacks will increase when the us pulls out despite continued us military support , at least for now , the recent bomb attacks and on-going unrest between arab nationalists and kurds in the northern city of mosul have raised concerns about an increase in violence in line with a reduction in us and allied involvement . general odierno blamed the recent attacks on " fractured extremist elements " and suggested that the bombings and unrest were designed to sow the seeds of doubt ahead of the us withdrawal . " they 're trying to use this time frame and this -lrb- pullout -rrb- date to first gain attention for themselves and also to divert attention from the success of the iraqi security forces , " he said , adding that the recent spike in attacks was not a sign of a broader increase of violence across the country . eu involvement in iraq at the mercy of us plans the iraqis and those concerned citizens in regional neighboring countries are not the only ones whose future could be cast into doubt by the partial us pull-out and then its final withdrawal . michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , believes the europeans involved in iraq have much to lose if the us withdrawal leads to an increase in violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's pm nuri al-maliki benefits from eu support " individually , european countries like germany and france have been unwilling to engage in iraq but the eu plays a large , important role in non-direct engagement , " he told deutsche welle .
" the eu is the main financial contributor to un and world bank projects there , it is involved in an energy dialogue and has recently upgraded its technical and co-operation agreement with iraq into a partnership . " the eu knows it can play a strong role in advancing administrative and electoral reforms , " bauer added .
" these are its specific strengths and the eu can help the government through this . " however , bauer said , if the us withdrawal leads to anarchy and civil war , the europeans will be in no position to address the violence . " these latest attacks are attempts by insurgents to stir up new sectarian violence and destabilize the country , " bauer said .
" this was in some ways expected but what is in question is whether the iraqis can govern through this and whether their army can provide protection when the americans go .
if not , all the eu initiatives in iraq will be at risk . " a self-sufficient iraq would welcome more eu aid the us withdrawal could also lead to an increased effort by the eu if stability and security is maintained . " the europeans could step up and play a stronger role by expanding on their specific strengths once the americans are gone , " bauer said .
" this could help iraq 's full transition and also help the stability of the region as the eu has good diplomatic ties with many of the arab states and to a certain degree , iran .
if iraq can govern and protect itself , the eu could become a strong political and diplomatic partner . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first batch of handsets that are n't tied to a particular charging device should hit the market in 2010 . europe 's avid mobile phone-users will soon be able to empty their drawers of the familiar tangle of chargers after leading manufacturers agreed on an industry standard . major mobile manufacturers , including apple , lg , motorola , nokia , samsung , sony ericsson und texas instruments , signed a deal on monday agreeing to a standard charger for all the cell phones they produce , the european commission said . a single , standard charger will cut costs to manufacturers and reduce the number of chargers thrown away when consumers buy new phones , eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said , adding that he wanted to see the common charger expanded to include other older phones , cameras and laptops in the years ahead . " i am very pleased that industry has found an agreement , which will make life much simpler for consumers , " verheugen said .
the commissioner had threatened to pass legislation on the issue if the industry failed to come up with a voluntary deal . non-binding agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older phones wo n't be covered by the new agreement phone-makers decided to use the currently available micro-usb plug for the mobiles they produce in the future .

the german company is on the brink of collapse and has said it urgently needs government aid to stay in business . for quelle , there are still hopes that disaster can be avoided .
the head of the company , konrad hilbers , on monday morning urged the government in berlin to decide in favor of the mail-order house and to grant a government loan that would bail the company at least out of its most urgent troubles . " there still is a way to avoid bankruptcy , " he said .
" we need to those discussions and urgently should get some positive results from berlin . " last wednesday , a committee of federal and state finance ministers considered extending quelle up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- worth of loans . the decision on whether or not the loan will be granted is expected to come monday evening after yet another meeting of the inter-ministerial committee . so far , chancellor angela merkel had been rather reluctant to rush to the rescue of quelle , defended her government 's reticence by pointing to the european union 's competition rules . " we have to let the eu in on the whole process , " she said , adding that nobody would benefit if the eu ruled against any state-loans after they had already been made . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer is concerned about the impact of job cuts in his state but the bavarian csu – sister party to merkel ’ s conservative cdu – over the weekend stepped up the pressure on berlin to rule in favor of quelle .

" if one wanted to summarise this result , one could say : the constitution says ' yes ' to the lisbon treaty but demands that parliament 's right to participation be strengthened at the national level , " the federal constitutional court said . " the court is confident that the last barrier for adopting the ratification document will be cleared . " the decision by the constitutional court in karlsruhe removes one of several remaining hurdles for the treaty , which aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all members of the bloc must ratify the document for it to take effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel has championed the treaty the german parliament has already approved the treaty , but the necessary signature from president horst koehler is missing .
he said he wo n't sign until the outcome of the court proceedings is known . there are still three other countries holding up the process : ireland , poland and the czech republic . ireland is set to hold another referendum on the text later this year , after its devastating no vote last year .
polls now indicate a swing in favor of the treaty . the polish parliament has approved the treaty , but president lech kaczynski says he wo n't sign until after the irish vote .
czech president vaclav klaus says he will wait until the last minute to add his signature . undermining sovereignty german opponents of the lisbon treaty had argued that the document undercuts german sovereignty .
they say that the country 's constitution would be subject to european law and say the constitutional court – which is deciding on the treaty on tuesday – would lose its authority . plaintiffs include members of the far-left political party die linke and conservative federal mp peter gauweiler from the csu party .
gauweiler said he feared the treaty would undermine the german parliament 's authority . " the only option left for the german parliament then would be to implement the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- decision , " he says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the treaty does not contradict the german constitution more democratic supporters of the lisbon treaty dismiss such fears , and insist that germany and europe would become more democratic and more transparent . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , from the csu 's sister conservative cdu party , says the treaty would protect the german constitution , not undermine it .
schaeuble says the constitution 's preamble , dating from 1949 , states that germany wants to be an equal member of a unified europe which works towards world peace . " from the beginning , this constitution was based on european unity , " he says . ca / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just 200 eu monitors are left , and they 're facing a volatile situation . territorial tensions in the caucasus have a long and tangled history , but since the break-up of the soviet union , russia and georgia have been repeatedly at odds over the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's not surprising , then , that several international observer and military missions have been active in the region . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has had a mission in georgia since 1992 to promote negotiations between conflicting parties and reach a peaceful political settlement .
in 1993 , the united nations created unomig , a military observer mission to verify compliance with a 1993 ceasefire agreement between georgian and abkhaz authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce 's mandate expires on june 30 tensions again came to a head in august 2008 when georgia launched a short but bloody attack on south ossetia .
russia , which has long supported the province 's claims to independence , responded by pouring thousands of troops into south ossetia .
georgian troops were forced out of south ossetia and abkhazia in a matter of days , with russian troops also occupying parts of georgia . under the ceasefire brokered with the help of then-eu president nicolas sarkozy , russia agreed to pull its troops back into south ossetia and abkhazia , but was repeatedly accused by western nations of failing to abide by the truce deal .
adding fuel to the fire , russia officially recognized the independence of the breakaway provinces , a move strongly condemned by the west , which maintains that the provinces are part of georgia . osce mandate expires june 30 as a result , the european union sent a team of 200 observers to georgia to monitor compliance with the six-point ceasefire agreement .
their one-year mandate began on oct.1 , 2008 . the eu monitors had been working in close cooperation with the osce and un missions , but now , the situation has changed dramatically . bildunterschrift : the osce 's main mission to georgia expired at the end of 2008 , but the organization continued to be represented by 20 unarmed military monitors on a mandate that expires on june 30 .
russia has scuppered negotiations on extending their mandate , and has denied them access to south ossetia since the war . earlier this month , russia also vetoed the extension of the un mission in georgia .
the un team had been monitoring the ceasefire along the border between georgia and abkhazia since the end of the war . un mission head johan verbeke said russia 's veto would undermine stability in abkhazia , leaving some 60,000 ethnic georgians there unprotected .

" in sum , russia has blinded the international community to what it is doing in the occupied georgian territories , " david j. smith , director of the georgian security analysis center wrote on georgiandaily.com , an independent english-language website based in new york .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is concerned about russia 's activities in south ossetia in a recent briefing , the international crisis group , a brussels-based think tank , also expressed its view that " the lack of an effective security regime in and around the conflict zones of south ossetia and abkhazia create a dangerous atmosphere in which extensive fighting could again erupt . " crisis group called on russia to " re-engage fully in discussions with the security council " in order to move past its june 15 veto and find a continued role for the un in georgia .

just 200 eu monitors are left , and they 're facing a volatile situation . territorial tensions in the caucasus have a long and tangled history , but since the break-up of the soviet union , russia and georgia have been repeatedly at odds over the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's not surprising , then , that several international observer and military missions have been active in the region . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has had a mission in georgia since 1992 to promote negotiations between conflicting parties and reach a peaceful political settlement .
in 1993 , the united nations created unomig , a military observer mission to verify compliance with a 1993 ceasefire agreement between georgian and abkhaz authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce 's mandate expires on june 30 tensions again came to a head in august 2008 when georgia launched a short but bloody attack on south ossetia .
russia , which has long supported the province 's claims to independence , responded by pouring thousands of troops into south ossetia .
georgian troops were forced out of south ossetia and abkhazia in a matter of days , with russian troops also occupying parts of georgia . under the ceasefire brokered with the help of then-eu president nicolas sarkozy , russia agreed to pull its troops back into south ossetia and abkhazia , but was repeatedly accused by western nations of failing to abide by the truce deal .
adding fuel to the fire , russia officially recognized the independence of the breakaway provinces , a move strongly condemned by the west , which maintains that the provinces are part of georgia . osce mandate expires june 30 as a result , the european union sent a team of 200 observers to georgia to monitor compliance with the six-point ceasefire agreement .
their one-year mandate began on oct.1 , 2008 . the eu monitors had been working in close cooperation with the osce and un missions , but now , the situation has changed dramatically . bildunterschrift : the osce 's main mission to georgia expired at the end of 2008 , but the organization continued to be represented by 20 unarmed military monitors on a mandate that expires on june 30 .
russia has scuppered negotiations on extending their mandate , and has denied them access to south ossetia since the war . earlier this month , russia also vetoed the extension of the un mission in georgia .
the un team had been monitoring the ceasefire along the border between georgia and abkhazia since the end of the war . un mission head johan verbeke said russia 's veto would undermine stability in abkhazia , leaving some 60,000 ethnic georgians there unprotected . " we 've contributed to ensuring that the population in abkhazia had a secure environment in which to operate , " verbeke told deutsche welle .
" i think this mission did effectively contribute to peace and security . " veil of secrecy now , that hard-won security is at stake .
with the departure of the osce and un observers , the eu has been left alone with around 200 monitors , who are unable to enter either south ossetia or abkhazia . " in sum , russia has blinded the international community to what it is doing in the occupied georgian territories , " david j. smith , director of the georgian security analysis center wrote on georgiandaily.com , an independent english-language website based in new york .
" behind its veil of secrecy , russia can continue to strengthen military logistics , perhaps preparing another armed attack on the rest of georgia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is concerned about russia 's activities in south ossetia in a recent briefing , the international crisis group , a brussels-based think tank , also expressed its view that " the lack of an effective security regime in and around the conflict zones of south ossetia and abkhazia create a dangerous atmosphere in which extensive fighting could again erupt . " crisis group called on russia to " re-engage fully in discussions with the security council " in order to move past its june 15 veto and find a continued role for the un in georgia .
it also called on the eu and other international organizations to invest the eu mission with an expanded role to address the situation on the ground . the head of the eu mission , joerg haber , is nonetheless confident that his team will be able to carry out its task of furthering stability in the region and patrolling the border to south ossetia , despite the loss of the osce and un observers . " we have enough people and vehicles to patrol the area and continue our work , " haber told deutsche welle .
" our mandate is not the same as those of the osce and the un .

just 200 eu monitors are left , and they 're facing a volatile situation . territorial tensions in the caucasus have a long and tangled history , but since the break-up of the soviet union , russia and georgia have been repeatedly at odds over the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's not surprising , then , that several international observer and military missions have been active in the region . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has had a mission in georgia since 1992 to promote negotiations between conflicting parties and reach a peaceful political settlement .
in 1993 , the united nations created unomig , a military observer mission to verify compliance with a 1993 ceasefire agreement between georgian and abkhaz authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce 's mandate expires on june 30 tensions again came to a head in august 2008 when georgia launched a short but bloody attack on south ossetia .
russia , which has long supported the province 's claims to independence , responded by pouring thousands of troops into south ossetia .
georgian troops were forced out of south ossetia and abkhazia in a matter of days , with russian troops also occupying parts of georgia . under the ceasefire brokered with the help of then-eu president nicolas sarkozy , russia agreed to pull its troops back into south ossetia and abkhazia , but was repeatedly accused by western nations of failing to abide by the truce deal .
adding fuel to the fire , russia officially recognized the independence of the breakaway provinces , a move strongly condemned by the west , which maintains that the provinces are part of georgia . osce mandate expires june 30 as a result , the european union sent a team of 200 observers to georgia to monitor compliance with the six-point ceasefire agreement .
their one-year mandate began on oct.1 , 2008 . the eu monitors had been working in close cooperation with the osce and un missions , but now , the situation has changed dramatically . bildunterschrift : the osce 's main mission to georgia expired at the end of 2008 , but the organization continued to be represented by 20 unarmed military monitors on a mandate that expires on june 30 .
russia has scuppered negotiations on extending their mandate , and has denied them access to south ossetia since the war . earlier this month , russia also vetoed the extension of the un mission in georgia .
the un team had been monitoring the ceasefire along the border between georgia and abkhazia since the end of the war . un mission head johan verbeke said russia 's veto would undermine stability in abkhazia , leaving some 60,000 ethnic georgians there unprotected . " we 've contributed to ensuring that the population in abkhazia had a secure environment in which to operate , " verbeke told deutsche welle .
" i think this mission did effectively contribute to peace and security . " veil of secrecy now , that hard-won security is at stake .
with the departure of the osce and un observers , the eu has been left alone with around 200 monitors , who are unable to enter either south ossetia or abkhazia . " in sum , russia has blinded the international community to what it is doing in the occupied georgian territories , " david j. smith , director of the georgian security analysis center wrote on georgiandaily.com , an independent english-language website based in new york .
" behind its veil of secrecy , russia can continue to strengthen military logistics , perhaps preparing another armed attack on the rest of georgia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is concerned about russia 's activities in south ossetia in a recent briefing , the international crisis group , a brussels-based think tank , also expressed its view that " the lack of an effective security regime in and around the conflict zones of south ossetia and abkhazia create a dangerous atmosphere in which extensive fighting could again erupt . " crisis group called on russia to " re-engage fully in discussions with the security council " in order to move past its june 15 veto and find a continued role for the un in georgia .
it also called on the eu and other international organizations to invest the eu mission with an expanded role to address the situation on the ground . the head of the eu mission , joerg haber , is nonetheless confident that his team will be able to carry out its task of furthering stability in the region and patrolling the border to south ossetia , despite the loss of the osce and un observers . " we have enough people and vehicles to patrol the area and continue our work , " haber told deutsche welle .
" our mandate is not the same as those of the osce and the un .
the osce had broader powers than us , and the un mission was mainly a mission of military observers .
that 's different to what we do , but i think we 're well positioned to safeguard security here . " haber added that he expects the eu member states to extend the mission in georgia by another year at the end of july . author : deanne corbett editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german company is on the brink of collapse and has said it urgently needs government aid to stay in business . for quelle , there are still hopes that disaster can be avoided .
the head of the company , konrad hilbers , on monday morning urged the government in berlin to decide in favor of the mail-order house and to grant a government loan that would bail the company at least out of its most urgent troubles . " there still is a way to avoid bankruptcy , " he said .
" we need to those discussions and urgently should get some positive results from berlin . " last wednesday , a committee of federal and state finance ministers considered extending quelle up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- worth of loans . the decision on whether or not the loan will be granted is expected to come monday evening after yet another meeting of the inter-ministerial committee . so far , chancellor angela merkel had been rather reluctant to rush to the rescue of quelle , defended her government 's reticence by pointing to the european union 's competition rules . " we have to let the eu in on the whole process , " she said , adding that nobody would benefit if the eu ruled against any state-loans after they had already been made . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer is concerned about the impact of job cuts in his state but the bavarian csu – sister party to merkel ’ s conservative cdu – over the weekend stepped up the pressure on berlin to rule in favor of quelle .
state premier horst seehofer , raised the stakes on sunday , june 28 , accusing his fellow conservatives in the federal government of putting thousands of jobs at risk . " jobs are at acute risk , nobody can want this , " seehofer said . what should be done ? the conservative politician demanded that berlin agree to contribute to a package of loans to save quelle , after it emerged on saturday that the company was unable to pay its suppliers and was teetering on the edge of collapse . bavaria , where most of quelle 's 8,000 employees are located , led the charge , pledging 21 million euros in aid .
the state of saxony offeredan additional 4 million euros . but the federal government later said that it wanted quelle to improve its application for assistance and that it would wait until the eu 's competition watchdog in brussels had reviewed the situation before contributing funds . death of a sales concept quelle is a highly symbolic german company , especially among the older generation , and has a mail-order catalogue featuring everything from washing machines to underwear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quelle 's winter catalogue was delivered with borrowed funds last week together with the department store chain karstadt , it is one of the most prominent casualties of the bankruptcy of its parent company arcandor . yet not everyone wants to see it bailed out . henning koopmann , the boss of quelle 's competitor neckermann , said any state rescue for his rival would be " unfair . " " a state-backed loan might save 8,000 jobs at quelle for now , but it would also endanger the 72,000 jobs at other mail-order companies in germany , " he said . bavaria 's opposition social democrats also criticized the regional government , accusing it of conducting a cynical drama on the backs of quelle employees . on saturday , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that quelle transferred all of its cash to its parent arcandor , only hours before that company declared insolvency on june 9 . an arcandor spokesperson later confirmed the report , but said the transfers were automated and not motivated by the insolvency . since then , quelle has been surviving off the kindness of its suppliers , who have suspended their invoices . nw / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just 200 eu monitors are left , and they 're facing a volatile situation . territorial tensions in the caucasus have a long and tangled history , but since the break-up of the soviet union , russia and georgia have been repeatedly at odds over the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's not surprising , then , that several international observer and military missions have been active in the region . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has had a mission in georgia since 1992 to promote negotiations between conflicting parties and reach a peaceful political settlement .
in 1993 , the united nations created unomig , a military observer mission to verify compliance with a 1993 ceasefire agreement between georgian and abkhaz authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce 's mandate expires on june 30 tensions again came to a head in august 2008 when georgia launched a short but bloody attack on south ossetia .
russia , which has long supported the province 's claims to independence , responded by pouring thousands of troops into south ossetia .
georgian troops were forced out of south ossetia and abkhazia in a matter of days , with russian troops also occupying parts of georgia . under the ceasefire brokered with the help of then-eu president nicolas sarkozy , russia agreed to pull its troops back into south ossetia and abkhazia , but was repeatedly accused by western nations of failing to abide by the truce deal .
adding fuel to the fire , russia officially recognized the independence of the breakaway provinces , a move strongly condemned by the west , which maintains that the provinces are part of georgia . osce mandate expires june 30 as a result , the european union sent a team of 200 observers to georgia to monitor compliance with the six-point ceasefire agreement .
their one-year mandate began on oct.1 , 2008 . the eu monitors had been working in close cooperation with the osce and un missions , but now , the situation has changed dramatically . bildunterschrift : the osce 's main mission to georgia expired at the end of 2008 , but the organization continued to be represented by 20 unarmed military monitors on a mandate that expires on june 30 .
russia has scuppered negotiations on extending their mandate , and has denied them access to south ossetia since the war . earlier this month , russia also vetoed the extension of the un mission in georgia .
the un team had been monitoring the ceasefire along the border between georgia and abkhazia since the end of the war . un mission head johan verbeke said russia 's veto would undermine stability in abkhazia , leaving some 60,000 ethnic georgians there unprotected . " we 've contributed to ensuring that the population in abkhazia had a secure environment in which to operate , " verbeke told deutsche welle .
" i think this mission did effectively contribute to peace and security . " veil of secrecy now , that hard-won security is at stake .
with the departure of the osce and un observers , the eu has been left alone with around 200 monitors , who are unable to enter either south ossetia or abkhazia . " in sum , russia has blinded the international community to what it is doing in the occupied georgian territories , " david j. smith , director of the georgian security analysis center wrote on georgiandaily.com , an independent english-language website based in new york .
" behind its veil of secrecy , russia can continue to strengthen military logistics , perhaps preparing another armed attack on the rest of georgia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is concerned about russia 's activities in south ossetia in a recent briefing , the international crisis group , a brussels-based think tank , also expressed its view that " the lack of an effective security regime in and around the conflict zones of south ossetia and abkhazia create a dangerous atmosphere in which extensive fighting could again erupt . " crisis group called on russia to " re-engage fully in discussions with the security council " in order to move past its june 15 veto and find a continued role for the un in georgia .
it also called on the eu and other international organizations to invest the eu mission with an expanded role to address the situation on the ground . the head of the eu mission , joerg haber , is nonetheless confident that his team will be able to carry out its task of furthering stability in the region and patrolling the border to south ossetia , despite the loss of the osce and un observers . " we have enough people and vehicles to patrol the area and continue our work , " haber told deutsche welle .
" our mandate is not the same as those of the osce and the un .
the osce had broader powers than us , and the un mission was mainly a mission of military observers .

just 200 eu monitors are left , and they 're facing a volatile situation . territorial tensions in the caucasus have a long and tangled history , but since the break-up of the soviet union , russia and georgia have been repeatedly at odds over the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's not surprising , then , that several international observer and military missions have been active in the region . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has had a mission in georgia since 1992 to promote negotiations between conflicting parties and reach a peaceful political settlement .
in 1993 , the united nations created unomig , a military observer mission to verify compliance with a 1993 ceasefire agreement between georgian and abkhaz authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce 's mandate expires on june 30 tensions again came to a head in august 2008 when georgia launched a short but bloody attack on south ossetia .
russia , which has long supported the province 's claims to independence , responded by pouring thousands of troops into south ossetia .
georgian troops were forced out of south ossetia and abkhazia in a matter of days , with russian troops also occupying parts of georgia . under the ceasefire brokered with the help of then-eu president nicolas sarkozy , russia agreed to pull its troops back into south ossetia and abkhazia , but was repeatedly accused by western nations of failing to abide by the truce deal .
adding fuel to the fire , russia officially recognized the independence of the breakaway provinces , a move strongly condemned by the west , which maintains that the provinces are part of georgia . osce mandate expires june 30 as a result , the european union sent a team of 200 observers to georgia to monitor compliance with the six-point ceasefire agreement .
their one-year mandate began on oct.1 , 2008 . the eu monitors had been working in close cooperation with the osce and un missions , but now , the situation has changed dramatically . bildunterschrift : the osce 's main mission to georgia expired at the end of 2008 , but the organization continued to be represented by 20 unarmed military monitors on a mandate that expires on june 30 .
russia has scuppered negotiations on extending their mandate , and has denied them access to south ossetia since the war . earlier this month , russia also vetoed the extension of the un mission in georgia .
the un team had been monitoring the ceasefire along the border between georgia and abkhazia since the end of the war . un mission head johan verbeke said russia 's veto would undermine stability in abkhazia , leaving some 60,000 ethnic georgians there unprotected . " we 've contributed to ensuring that the population in abkhazia had a secure environment in which to operate , " verbeke told deutsche welle .
" i think this mission did effectively contribute to peace and security . " veil of secrecy now , that hard-won security is at stake .
with the departure of the osce and un observers , the eu has been left alone with around 200 monitors , who are unable to enter either south ossetia or abkhazia . " in sum , russia has blinded the international community to what it is doing in the occupied georgian territories , " david j. smith , director of the georgian security analysis center wrote on georgiandaily.com , an independent english-language website based in new york .
" behind its veil of secrecy , russia can continue to strengthen military logistics , perhaps preparing another armed attack on the rest of georgia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is concerned about russia 's activities in south ossetia in a recent briefing , the international crisis group , a brussels-based think tank , also expressed its view that " the lack of an effective security regime in and around the conflict zones of south ossetia and abkhazia create a dangerous atmosphere in which extensive fighting could again erupt . " crisis group called on russia to " re-engage fully in discussions with the security council " in order to move past its june 15 veto and find a continued role for the un in georgia .
it also called on the eu and other international organizations to invest the eu mission with an expanded role to address the situation on the ground . the head of the eu mission , joerg haber , is nonetheless confident that his team will be able to carry out its task of furthering stability in the region and patrolling the border to south ossetia , despite the loss of the osce and un observers . " we have enough people and vehicles to patrol the area and continue our work , " haber told deutsche welle .
" our mandate is not the same as those of the osce and the un .
the osce had broader powers than us , and the un mission was mainly a mission of military observers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 29.06.2009 in caucasus , eu monitors must deal with tensions alone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are warning of volatility in the separatist regions in the conflict-prone caucasus , concern is mounting about a security vacuum following the end of the un and osce 's observer missions .
just 200 eu monitors are left , and they 're facing a volatile situation . territorial tensions in the caucasus have a long and tangled history , but since the break-up of the soviet union , russia and georgia have been repeatedly at odds over the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's not surprising , then , that several international observer and military missions have been active in the region . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has had a mission in georgia since 1992 to promote negotiations between conflicting parties and reach a peaceful political settlement .
in 1993 , the united nations created unomig , a military observer mission to verify compliance with a 1993 ceasefire agreement between georgian and abkhaz authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce 's mandate expires on june 30 tensions again came to a head in august 2008 when georgia launched a short but bloody attack on south ossetia .
russia , which has long supported the province 's claims to independence , responded by pouring thousands of troops into south ossetia .
georgian troops were forced out of south ossetia and abkhazia in a matter of days , with russian troops also occupying parts of georgia . under the ceasefire brokered with the help of then-eu president nicolas sarkozy , russia agreed to pull its troops back into south ossetia and abkhazia , but was repeatedly accused by western nations of failing to abide by the truce deal .
adding fuel to the fire , russia officially recognized the independence of the breakaway provinces , a move strongly condemned by the west , which maintains that the provinces are part of georgia . osce mandate expires june 30 as a result , the european union sent a team of 200 observers to georgia to monitor compliance with the six-point ceasefire agreement .
their one-year mandate began on oct.1 , 2008 . the eu monitors had been working in close cooperation with the osce and un missions , but now , the situation has changed dramatically . bildunterschrift : the osce 's main mission to georgia expired at the end of 2008 , but the organization continued to be represented by 20 unarmed military monitors on a mandate that expires on june 30 .
russia has scuppered negotiations on extending their mandate , and has denied them access to south ossetia since the war . earlier this month , russia also vetoed the extension of the un mission in georgia .
the un team had been monitoring the ceasefire along the border between georgia and abkhazia since the end of the war . un mission head johan verbeke said russia 's veto would undermine stability in abkhazia , leaving some 60,000 ethnic georgians there unprotected . " we 've contributed to ensuring that the population in abkhazia had a secure environment in which to operate , " verbeke told deutsche welle .
" i think this mission did effectively contribute to peace and security . " veil of secrecy now , that hard-won security is at stake .
with the departure of the osce and un observers , the eu has been left alone with around 200 monitors , who are unable to enter either south ossetia or abkhazia . " in sum , russia has blinded the international community to what it is doing in the occupied georgian territories , " david j. smith , director of the georgian security analysis center wrote on georgiandaily.com , an independent english-language website based in new york .
" behind its veil of secrecy , russia can continue to strengthen military logistics , perhaps preparing another armed attack on the rest of georgia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is concerned about russia 's activities in south ossetia in a recent briefing , the international crisis group , a brussels-based think tank , also expressed its view that " the lack of an effective security regime in and around the conflict zones of south ossetia and abkhazia create a dangerous atmosphere in which extensive fighting could again erupt . " crisis group called on russia to " re-engage fully in discussions with the security council " in order to move past its june 15 veto and find a continued role for the un in georgia .
it also called on the eu and other international organizations to invest the eu mission with an expanded role to address the situation on the ground . the head of the eu mission , joerg haber , is nonetheless confident that his team will be able to carry out its task of furthering stability in the region and patrolling the border to south ossetia , despite the loss of the osce and un observers . " we have enough people and vehicles to patrol the area and continue our work , " haber told deutsche welle .
" our mandate is not the same as those of the osce and the un .
the osce had broader powers than us , and the un mission was mainly a mission of military observers .
that 's different to what we do , but i think we 're well positioned to safeguard security here . " haber added that he expects the eu member states to extend the mission in georgia by another year at the end of july . author : deanne corbett editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 1993 , the united nations created unomig , a military observer mission to verify compliance with a 1993 ceasefire agreement between georgian and abkhaz authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce 's mandate expires on june 30 tensions again came to a head in august 2008 when georgia launched a short but bloody attack on south ossetia .
russia , which has long supported the province 's claims to independence , responded by pouring thousands of troops into south ossetia .
georgian troops were forced out of south ossetia and abkhazia in a matter of days , with russian troops also occupying parts of georgia . under the ceasefire brokered with the help of then-eu president nicolas sarkozy , russia agreed to pull its troops back into south ossetia and abkhazia , but was repeatedly accused by western nations of failing to abide by the truce deal .
adding fuel to the fire , russia officially recognized the independence of the breakaway provinces , a move strongly condemned by the west , which maintains that the provinces are part of georgia . osce mandate expires june 30 as a result , the european union sent a team of 200 observers to georgia to monitor compliance with the six-point ceasefire agreement .
their one-year mandate began on oct.1 , 2008 . the eu monitors had been working in close cooperation with the osce and un missions , but now , the situation has changed dramatically . bildunterschrift : the osce 's main mission to georgia expired at the end of 2008 , but the organization continued to be represented by 20 unarmed military monitors on a mandate that expires on june 30 .
russia has scuppered negotiations on extending their mandate , and has denied them access to south ossetia since the war . earlier this month , russia also vetoed the extension of the un mission in georgia .
the un team had been monitoring the ceasefire along the border between georgia and abkhazia since the end of the war . un mission head johan verbeke said russia 's veto would undermine stability in abkhazia , leaving some 60,000 ethnic georgians there unprotected . " we 've contributed to ensuring that the population in abkhazia had a secure environment in which to operate , " verbeke told deutsche welle .
" i think this mission did effectively contribute to peace and security . " veil of secrecy now , that hard-won security is at stake .
with the departure of the osce and un observers , the eu has been left alone with around 200 monitors , who are unable to enter either south ossetia or abkhazia . " in sum , russia has blinded the international community to what it is doing in the occupied georgian territories , " david j. smith , director of the georgian security analysis center wrote on georgiandaily.com , an independent english-language website based in new york .
" behind its veil of secrecy , russia can continue to strengthen military logistics , perhaps preparing another armed attack on the rest of georgia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is concerned about russia 's activities in south ossetia in a recent briefing , the international crisis group , a brussels-based think tank , also expressed its view that " the lack of an effective security regime in and around the conflict zones of south ossetia and abkhazia create a dangerous atmosphere in which extensive fighting could again erupt . " crisis group called on russia to " re-engage fully in discussions with the security council " in order to move past its june 15 veto and find a continued role for the un in georgia .
it also called on the eu and other international organizations to invest the eu mission with an expanded role to address the situation on the ground . the head of the eu mission , joerg haber , is nonetheless confident that his team will be able to carry out its task of furthering stability in the region and patrolling the border to south ossetia , despite the loss of the osce and un observers . " we have enough people and vehicles to patrol the area and continue our work , " haber told deutsche welle .
" our mandate is not the same as those of the osce and the un .

just 200 eu monitors are left , and they 're facing a volatile situation . territorial tensions in the caucasus have a long and tangled history , but since the break-up of the soviet union , russia and georgia have been repeatedly at odds over the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's not surprising , then , that several international observer and military missions have been active in the region . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has had a mission in georgia since 1992 to promote negotiations between conflicting parties and reach a peaceful political settlement .
in 1993 , the united nations created unomig , a military observer mission to verify compliance with a 1993 ceasefire agreement between georgian and abkhaz authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce 's mandate expires on june 30 tensions again came to a head in august 2008 when georgia launched a short but bloody attack on south ossetia .
russia , which has long supported the province 's claims to independence , responded by pouring thousands of troops into south ossetia .
georgian troops were forced out of south ossetia and abkhazia in a matter of days , with russian troops also occupying parts of georgia . under the ceasefire brokered with the help of then-eu president nicolas sarkozy , russia agreed to pull its troops back into south ossetia and abkhazia , but was repeatedly accused by western nations of failing to abide by the truce deal .
adding fuel to the fire , russia officially recognized the independence of the breakaway provinces , a move strongly condemned by the west , which maintains that the provinces are part of georgia . osce mandate expires june 30 as a result , the european union sent a team of 200 observers to georgia to monitor compliance with the six-point ceasefire agreement .
their one-year mandate began on oct.1 , 2008 . the eu monitors had been working in close cooperation with the osce and un missions , but now , the situation has changed dramatically . bildunterschrift : the osce 's main mission to georgia expired at the end of 2008 , but the organization continued to be represented by 20 unarmed military monitors on a mandate that expires on june 30 .
russia has scuppered negotiations on extending their mandate , and has denied them access to south ossetia since the war . earlier this month , russia also vetoed the extension of the un mission in georgia .
the un team had been monitoring the ceasefire along the border between georgia and abkhazia since the end of the war . un mission head johan verbeke said russia 's veto would undermine stability in abkhazia , leaving some 60,000 ethnic georgians there unprotected . " we 've contributed to ensuring that the population in abkhazia had a secure environment in which to operate , " verbeke told deutsche welle .
" i think this mission did effectively contribute to peace and security . " veil of secrecy now , that hard-won security is at stake .
with the departure of the osce and un observers , the eu has been left alone with around 200 monitors , who are unable to enter either south ossetia or abkhazia . " in sum , russia has blinded the international community to what it is doing in the occupied georgian territories , " david j. smith , director of the georgian security analysis center wrote on georgiandaily.com , an independent english-language website based in new york .
" behind its veil of secrecy , russia can continue to strengthen military logistics , perhaps preparing another armed attack on the rest of georgia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is concerned about russia 's activities in south ossetia in a recent briefing , the international crisis group , a brussels-based think tank , also expressed its view that " the lack of an effective security regime in and around the conflict zones of south ossetia and abkhazia create a dangerous atmosphere in which extensive fighting could again erupt . " crisis group called on russia to " re-engage fully in discussions with the security council " in order to move past its june 15 veto and find a continued role for the un in georgia .
it also called on the eu and other international organizations to invest the eu mission with an expanded role to address the situation on the ground . the head of the eu mission , joerg haber , is nonetheless confident that his team will be able to carry out its task of furthering stability in the region and patrolling the border to south ossetia , despite the loss of the osce and un observers . " we have enough people and vehicles to patrol the area and continue our work , " haber told deutsche welle .
" our mandate is not the same as those of the osce and the un .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.06.2009 merkel makes tax cuts into her pitch for re-election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is personally popular , but her party still only polls 35 percent in 90 days germans elect a new government .
chancellor angela merkel has promised tax cuts to secure her party 's re-election , but rivals from left to right are attacking her program as unrealistic . germany 's conservatives have kicked off their election campaign with an explicit appeal to the middle-class .
" we want to relieve the burden on the middle of society , " said christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- general secretary , ronald pofalla , at the opening of the party conference in berlin on monday .
pofalla attacked his party 's main rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , accusing them of pursuing a strategy of " division and envy . "
" we want to reduce taxes , the spd wants to raise them .
we will make this abundantly clear over the next three months , " he said .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu agreed at the weekend that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign .
the main policy would be a modest cut in the lowest income tax bracket from 14 to 12 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier guenther oettinger has called for a rise in sales tax dissent in the ranks but there have been opposing voices among the conservatives .
two cdu state premiers have openly advocated an increase in certain taxes , such as value added tax , to offset the blowout in public expenditures caused by the global economic downturn .
so it was with an eye to the dissenters that chancellor merkel called for party unity when she took to the stage at the party conference , to the drawn-out applause of over 750 party deputies .
" sometimes a bit of lateral thinking is needed , " she said , in a veiled reference to her party 's internal tax-debate , " but we 've thought for long enough . "
merkel vowed , if re-elected , not to raise value added tax during the next term of office , but did n't elaborate on how her tax-cuts would be financed or when they would be introduced .
she also advocated her party 's goal of winning enough votes to ditch the spd as coalition partner in favour of the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we have the power to make our country stronger than it was before .
we have the power to promote growth ... and we say , we can best do this with a different coalition partner , " she said .
criticism from left and right the social democrats ' secretary-general , hubertus heil , said the cdu 's agenda " was not credible . "
he warned that " merkel is either trying to pull the wool over the voter 's eyes , or there really is no sound concept behind the whole thing . "
heil said that the cdu 's election program did not contain ideas on how to shape the country 's future .
with the country 's budget set for a record deficit , any promise to lower taxes was simply " unrealistic . "
criticism also came from the fdp - normally a strong advocate for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy , set to shrink by six percent , will be a key campaign theme the party 's juergen koppelin criticized the plans as " very vague and non-binding " , calling them " spineless " for not including a timetable to introduce the tax cuts .
but fdp leader , guido westerwelle , welcomed the conservatives ' overtures to form a coalition , calling their program a " good basis " for working together .
in contrast , the greens ' claudia roth , also with an eye on possible coalition talks , said the conservatives ' platform was looking " very distant from us . "
the latest opinion poll puts the conservatives on 35 percent of the vote .
right now , that would be just enough to win government with the fdp , who are polling 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left spd , the minority party in merkel 's government , still hopes to retain power in a second grand coalition .

" if one wanted to summarise this result , one could say : the constitution says ' yes ' to the lisbon treaty but demands that parliament 's right to participation be strengthened at the national level , " the federal constitutional court said . " the court is confident that the last barrier for adopting the ratification document will be cleared . " the decision by the constitutional court in karlsruhe removes one of several remaining hurdles for the treaty , which aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all members of the bloc must ratify the document for it to take effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel has championed the treaty the german parliament has already approved the treaty , but the necessary signature from president horst koehler is missing .
he said he wo n't sign until the outcome of the court proceedings is known . there are still three other countries holding up the process : ireland , poland and the czech republic . ireland is set to hold another referendum on the text later this year , after its devastating no vote last year .
polls now indicate a swing in favor of the treaty . the polish parliament has approved the treaty , but president lech kaczynski says he wo n't sign until after the irish vote .
czech president vaclav klaus says he will wait until the last minute to add his signature . undermining sovereignty german opponents of the lisbon treaty had argued that the document undercuts german sovereignty .
they say that the country 's constitution would be subject to european law and say the constitutional court – which is deciding on the treaty on tuesday – would lose its authority . plaintiffs include members of the far-left political party die linke and conservative federal mp peter gauweiler from the csu party .
gauweiler said he feared the treaty would undermine the german parliament 's authority . " the only option left for the german parliament then would be to implement the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- decision , " he says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the treaty does not contradict the german constitution more democratic supporters of the lisbon treaty dismiss such fears , and insist that germany and europe would become more democratic and more transparent . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , from the csu 's sister conservative cdu party , says the treaty would protect the german constitution , not undermine it .
schaeuble says the constitution 's preamble , dating from 1949 , states that germany wants to be an equal member of a unified europe which works towards world peace . " from the beginning , this constitution was based on european unity , " he says . ca / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first batch of handsets that are n't tied to a particular charging device should hit the market in 2010 . europe 's avid mobile phone-users will soon be able to empty their drawers of the familiar tangle of chargers after leading manufacturers agreed on an industry standard . major mobile manufacturers , including apple , lg , motorola , nokia , samsung , sony ericsson und texas instruments , signed a deal on monday agreeing to a standard charger for all the cell phones they produce , the european commission said . a single , standard charger will cut costs to manufacturers and reduce the number of chargers thrown away when consumers buy new phones , eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said , adding that he wanted to see the common charger expanded to include other older phones , cameras and laptops in the years ahead . " i am very pleased that industry has found an agreement , which will make life much simpler for consumers , " verheugen said .
the commissioner had threatened to pass legislation on the issue if the industry failed to come up with a voluntary deal . non-binding agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older phones wo n't be covered by the new agreement phone-makers decided to use the currently available micro-usb plug for the mobiles they produce in the future .
the deal also means the creation of an eu norm for new mobile phones . manufacturers originally developed different chargers to match their batteries , since those that were not charged correctly run the risk of exploding . the mobile industry said the number of chargers produced every year could be cut in half when the new agreement goes into effect .
it is estimated that tons of trash pile into landfills every year as consumers throw away chargers when switching cell phones . the eu represents the world 's biggest market for mobile phones , with between 350 and 400 million currently in operation and some 185 million new ones sold each year . monday 's agreement is , however , not legally binding . sms / dpa / ap / retuers editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just 200 eu monitors are left , and they 're facing a volatile situation . territorial tensions in the caucasus have a long and tangled history , but since the break-up of the soviet union , russia and georgia have been repeatedly at odds over the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's not surprising , then , that several international observer and military missions have been active in the region . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has had a mission in georgia since 1992 to promote negotiations between conflicting parties and reach a peaceful political settlement .
in 1993 , the united nations created unomig , a military observer mission to verify compliance with a 1993 ceasefire agreement between georgian and abkhaz authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce 's mandate expires on june 30 tensions again came to a head in august 2008 when georgia launched a short but bloody attack on south ossetia .
russia , which has long supported the province 's claims to independence , responded by pouring thousands of troops into south ossetia .
georgian troops were forced out of south ossetia and abkhazia in a matter of days , with russian troops also occupying parts of georgia . under the ceasefire brokered with the help of then-eu president nicolas sarkozy , russia agreed to pull its troops back into south ossetia and abkhazia , but was repeatedly accused by western nations of failing to abide by the truce deal .
adding fuel to the fire , russia officially recognized the independence of the breakaway provinces , a move strongly condemned by the west , which maintains that the provinces are part of georgia . osce mandate expires june 30 as a result , the european union sent a team of 200 observers to georgia to monitor compliance with the six-point ceasefire agreement .
their one-year mandate began on oct.1 , 2008 . the eu monitors had been working in close cooperation with the osce and un missions , but now , the situation has changed dramatically . bildunterschrift : the osce 's main mission to georgia expired at the end of 2008 , but the organization continued to be represented by 20 unarmed military monitors on a mandate that expires on june 30 .
russia has scuppered negotiations on extending their mandate , and has denied them access to south ossetia since the war . earlier this month , russia also vetoed the extension of the un mission in georgia .
the un team had been monitoring the ceasefire along the border between georgia and abkhazia since the end of the war . un mission head johan verbeke said russia 's veto would undermine stability in abkhazia , leaving some 60,000 ethnic georgians there unprotected . " we 've contributed to ensuring that the population in abkhazia had a secure environment in which to operate , " verbeke told deutsche welle .
" i think this mission did effectively contribute to peace and security . " veil of secrecy now , that hard-won security is at stake .
with the departure of the osce and un observers , the eu has been left alone with around 200 monitors , who are unable to enter either south ossetia or abkhazia . " in sum , russia has blinded the international community to what it is doing in the occupied georgian territories , " david j. smith , director of the georgian security analysis center wrote on georgiandaily.com , an independent english-language website based in new york .
" behind its veil of secrecy , russia can continue to strengthen military logistics , perhaps preparing another armed attack on the rest of georgia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is concerned about russia 's activities in south ossetia in a recent briefing , the international crisis group , a brussels-based think tank , also expressed its view that " the lack of an effective security regime in and around the conflict zones of south ossetia and abkhazia create a dangerous atmosphere in which extensive fighting could again erupt . " crisis group called on russia to " re-engage fully in discussions with the security council " in order to move past its june 15 veto and find a continued role for the un in georgia .
it also called on the eu and other international organizations to invest the eu mission with an expanded role to address the situation on the ground . the head of the eu mission , joerg haber , is nonetheless confident that his team will be able to carry out its task of furthering stability in the region and patrolling the border to south ossetia , despite the loss of the osce and un observers . " we have enough people and vehicles to patrol the area and continue our work , " haber told deutsche welle .
" our mandate is not the same as those of the osce and the un .
the osce had broader powers than us , and the un mission was mainly a mission of military observers .
that 's different to what we do , but i think we 're well positioned to safeguard security here . " haber added that he expects the eu member states to extend the mission in georgia by another year at the end of july . author : deanne corbett editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this seems to confirm the unanimous and uncontested tradition that they are the mortal remains of the apostle paul , " added benedict . paul - born saul - had actively persecuted christians , but converted after seeing jesus in a vision while on the road to damascus . he is believed to have been beheaded in the year 67 in rome after years of travel as an early missionary to spread the message of jesus . archeologists collected the bone fragments by inserting a probe through a small hole in the tomb , which is located under the basilica 's main altar . bits of incense , purple linen with gold sequins and blue linen were also found , said the pope . though the findings had been known for more than a year , the vatican waited for benedict to make the official announcement .

now the vatican wants to open the sarcophagus and conduct further tests . the marble coffin in rome 's st. paul 's basilica has never been opened , but , according to tests conducted thus far , the tomb contains pieces of human bone that have been dated to the time of saint paul . pope benedict shared the findings sunday at a service outside the church marking the end of the vatican 's pauline year in honor of the apostle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tomb in st. paul 's basilica has been sealed for some five centuries carbon dating showed that the bone fragments belonged to someone who lived between the first and the second century ad , the pontiff said . " this seems to confirm the unanimous and uncontested tradition that they are the mortal remains of the apostle paul , " added benedict . paul - born saul - had actively persecuted christians , but converted after seeing jesus in a vision while on the road to damascus . he is believed to have been beheaded in the year 67 in rome after years of travel as an early missionary to spread the message of jesus . archeologists collected the bone fragments by inserting a probe through a small hole in the tomb , which is located under the basilica 's main altar . bits of incense , purple linen with gold sequins and blue linen were also found , said the pope . though the findings had been known for more than a year , the vatican waited for benedict to make the official announcement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.06.2009 merkel makes tax cuts into her pitch for re-election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is personally popular , but her party still only polls 35 percent in 90 days germans elect a new government .
chancellor angela merkel has promised tax cuts to secure her party 's re-election , but rivals from left to right are attacking her program as unrealistic . germany 's conservatives have kicked off their election campaign with an explicit appeal to the middle-class .
" we want to relieve the burden on the middle of society , " said christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- general secretary , ronald pofalla , at the opening of the party conference in berlin on monday .
pofalla attacked his party 's main rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , accusing them of pursuing a strategy of " division and envy . "
" we want to reduce taxes , the spd wants to raise them .
we will make this abundantly clear over the next three months , " he said .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu agreed at the weekend that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign .
the main policy would be a modest cut in the lowest income tax bracket from 14 to 12 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier guenther oettinger has called for a rise in sales tax dissent in the ranks but there have been opposing voices among the conservatives .
two cdu state premiers have openly advocated an increase in certain taxes , such as value added tax , to offset the blowout in public expenditures caused by the global economic downturn .
so it was with an eye to the dissenters that chancellor merkel called for party unity when she took to the stage at the party conference , to the drawn-out applause of over 750 party deputies .
" sometimes a bit of lateral thinking is needed , " she said , in a veiled reference to her party 's internal tax-debate , " but we 've thought for long enough . "
merkel vowed , if re-elected , not to raise value added tax during the next term of office , but did n't elaborate on how her tax-cuts would be financed or when they would be introduced .
she also advocated her party 's goal of winning enough votes to ditch the spd as coalition partner in favour of the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we have the power to make our country stronger than it was before .
we have the power to promote growth ... and we say , we can best do this with a different coalition partner , " she said .
criticism from left and right the social democrats ' secretary-general , hubertus heil , said the cdu 's agenda " was not credible . "
he warned that " merkel is either trying to pull the wool over the voter 's eyes , or there really is no sound concept behind the whole thing . "
heil said that the cdu 's election program did not contain ideas on how to shape the country 's future .
with the country 's budget set for a record deficit , any promise to lower taxes was simply " unrealistic . "
criticism also came from the fdp - normally a strong advocate for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy , set to shrink by six percent , will be a key campaign theme the party 's juergen koppelin criticized the plans as " very vague and non-binding " , calling them " spineless " for not including a timetable to introduce the tax cuts .
but fdp leader , guido westerwelle , welcomed the conservatives ' overtures to form a coalition , calling their program a " good basis " for working together .
in contrast , the greens ' claudia roth , also with an eye on possible coalition talks , said the conservatives ' platform was looking " very distant from us . "
the latest opinion poll puts the conservatives on 35 percent of the vote .
right now , that would be just enough to win government with the fdp , who are polling 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left spd , the minority party in merkel 's government , still hopes to retain power in a second grand coalition .

chancellor angela merkel has promised tax cuts to secure her party 's re-election , but rivals from left to right are attacking her program as unrealistic . germany 's conservatives have kicked off their election campaign with an explicit appeal to the middle-class .
" we want to relieve the burden on the middle of society , " said christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- general secretary , ronald pofalla , at the opening of the party conference in berlin on monday .
pofalla attacked his party 's main rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , accusing them of pursuing a strategy of " division and envy . "
" we want to reduce taxes , the spd wants to raise them .
we will make this abundantly clear over the next three months , " he said .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu agreed at the weekend that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign .
the main policy would be a modest cut in the lowest income tax bracket from 14 to 12 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier guenther oettinger has called for a rise in sales tax dissent in the ranks but there have been opposing voices among the conservatives .
two cdu state premiers have openly advocated an increase in certain taxes , such as value added tax , to offset the blowout in public expenditures caused by the global economic downturn .
so it was with an eye to the dissenters that chancellor merkel called for party unity when she took to the stage at the party conference , to the drawn-out applause of over 750 party deputies .
" sometimes a bit of lateral thinking is needed , " she said , in a veiled reference to her party 's internal tax-debate , " but we 've thought for long enough . "
merkel vowed , if re-elected , not to raise value added tax during the next term of office , but did n't elaborate on how her tax-cuts would be financed or when they would be introduced .
she also advocated her party 's goal of winning enough votes to ditch the spd as coalition partner in favour of the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we have the power to make our country stronger than it was before .
we have the power to promote growth ... and we say , we can best do this with a different coalition partner , " she said .
criticism from left and right the social democrats ' secretary-general , hubertus heil , said the cdu 's agenda " was not credible . "
he warned that " merkel is either trying to pull the wool over the voter 's eyes , or there really is no sound concept behind the whole thing . "
heil said that the cdu 's election program did not contain ideas on how to shape the country 's future .
with the country 's budget set for a record deficit , any promise to lower taxes was simply " unrealistic . "
criticism also came from the fdp - normally a strong advocate for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy , set to shrink by six percent , will be a key campaign theme the party 's juergen koppelin criticized the plans as " very vague and non-binding " , calling them " spineless " for not including a timetable to introduce the tax cuts .
but fdp leader , guido westerwelle , welcomed the conservatives ' overtures to form a coalition , calling their program a " good basis " for working together .
in contrast , the greens ' claudia roth , also with an eye on possible coalition talks , said the conservatives ' platform was looking " very distant from us . "
the latest opinion poll puts the conservatives on 35 percent of the vote .
right now , that would be just enough to win government with the fdp , who are polling 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left spd , the minority party in merkel 's government , still hopes to retain power in a second grand coalition .
but its goal of forming government with the greens seems increasingly unlikely .

chancellor angela merkel has promised tax cuts to secure her party 's re-election , but rivals from left to right are attacking her program as unrealistic . germany 's conservatives have kicked off their election campaign with an explicit appeal to the middle-class .
" we want to relieve the burden on the middle of society , " said christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- general secretary , ronald pofalla , at the opening of the party conference in berlin on monday .
pofalla attacked his party 's main rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , accusing them of pursuing a strategy of " division and envy . "
" we want to reduce taxes , the spd wants to raise them .
we will make this abundantly clear over the next three months , " he said .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu agreed at the weekend that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign .
the main policy would be a modest cut in the lowest income tax bracket from 14 to 12 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier guenther oettinger has called for a rise in sales tax dissent in the ranks but there have been opposing voices among the conservatives .
two cdu state premiers have openly advocated an increase in certain taxes , such as value added tax , to offset the blowout in public expenditures caused by the global economic downturn .
so it was with an eye to the dissenters that chancellor merkel called for party unity when she took to the stage at the party conference , to the drawn-out applause of over 750 party deputies .
" sometimes a bit of lateral thinking is needed , " she said , in a veiled reference to her party 's internal tax-debate , " but we 've thought for long enough . "
merkel vowed , if re-elected , not to raise value added tax during the next term of office , but did n't elaborate on how her tax-cuts would be financed or when they would be introduced .
she also advocated her party 's goal of winning enough votes to ditch the spd as coalition partner in favour of the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we have the power to make our country stronger than it was before .
we have the power to promote growth ... and we say , we can best do this with a different coalition partner , " she said .
criticism from left and right the social democrats ' secretary-general , hubertus heil , said the cdu 's agenda " was not credible . "
he warned that " merkel is either trying to pull the wool over the voter 's eyes , or there really is no sound concept behind the whole thing . "
heil said that the cdu 's election program did not contain ideas on how to shape the country 's future .
with the country 's budget set for a record deficit , any promise to lower taxes was simply " unrealistic . "
criticism also came from the fdp - normally a strong advocate for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy , set to shrink by six percent , will be a key campaign theme the party 's juergen koppelin criticized the plans as " very vague and non-binding " , calling them " spineless " for not including a timetable to introduce the tax cuts .
but fdp leader , guido westerwelle , welcomed the conservatives ' overtures to form a coalition , calling their program a " good basis " for working together .
in contrast , the greens ' claudia roth , also with an eye on possible coalition talks , said the conservatives ' platform was looking " very distant from us . "
the latest opinion poll puts the conservatives on 35 percent of the vote .
right now , that would be just enough to win government with the fdp , who are polling 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left spd , the minority party in merkel 's government , still hopes to retain power in a second grand coalition .
but its goal of forming government with the greens seems increasingly unlikely .
the two parties are currently polling 24 and 15 percent respectively. nw / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 29.06.2009 exit polls indicate tight race in albanian polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as votes are counted , albania 's ruling party is holding on to its lead in exit polls .
while the central election commission has not made any official announcements , exit polls appear to indicate a win for prime minister sali berisha 's democratic party over the socialists led by edi rama . 24 hours after the polls closed , ballots were still being counted electronically in albania . some 3.1 million albanians were eligible to vote on sunday .
they were casting ballots for 140 legislators , at least 30 percent of whom must be women .
prime minister berisha has been the country 's dominant political figure since the fall of communism fall in 1991 .
the 65-year-old campaigned with promises of quick eu accession and improving the infrastructure and living conditions .
edi rama , mayor of the capital tirana , promised to get rid of what he described as berisha 's nepotist structures in the administration , pledging to do more for albania 's poor .
election day passed without any of the problems that many had feared , although the campaign itself had been marred by violence , including two deaths .
" i ca n't say that these elections were perfect , because no election process is perfect , but these elections were far better than any before . " said berisha once voting had concluded on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berisha is looking for a second term the international election observation mission said the election process showed improvements , but added that violations persist .
hundreds of international observers monitored sunday 's vote to ensure fairness .
vote was orderly , europe 's human rights and security watchdog says the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- monitoring mission chief robert bosch said there were " slight irregularities , " but that they were fewer and less grave than in previous elections .
the european union and the united states have closely watched the vote , which they regard as a test of the tiny country 's readiness for integration with europe . albania joined nato in april , applying the same month to join the european union .
three years ago , tirana took its first step toward eu membership when it signed the stabilisation and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with brussels .
but the southern balkan nation has yet to shrug off the image of a backward , isolated country that it earned during decades under a harsh communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edi rama is popular among younger voters think tank says much is at stake for albania christophe solioz , an expert on the balkans at the geneva-based center for european integration strategies think-tank , told deutsche welle that the eu must renew its political commitment to integrate tirana . in albania , he says , there is a readiness , a political will : “ albania is progressing step-by-step as it overcomes the past culture of corruption and lawlessness .
it is also , step-by-step , meeting the eu benchmarks . the country definitely is on the way ! ”
while solioz estimates that eu membership is at least another ten years away for albania , he says the process must now be clearly defined so the political elite does n't lose hope . a visa-free travel regime for albanians to europe , he says , should be the next step. db / nk / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the talks , hosted by the european commission , are taking place less than a week before kiev will be expected to hand over three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to russia for gas that it has started to store for the coming winter .
a dispute over payment earlier this year led to russia shutting off gas supplies to ukraine , which affected not only citizens there , but also those living in parts of the european union which depend on gas coming from pipelines running through ukraine .
a quarter of all the natural gas burned within the eu comes from russia , with 80 percent of that flowing through ukraine , mostly to the south-eastern corner of the continent .
transparency an issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is betting on a pipeline across the baltic sea to save itself from these disputes in the future weighed down by the global financial crisis , kiev claims it wo n't be able to come up with the money in time to buy the roughly 20 billion cubic meters of natural gas that it wants , and that has incited the eu to call on the international community to give ukraine a short term loan .
however , many organizations , including the imf , are n't convinced that naftogaz is in a position to receive funding .
ceyla pazarbasioglu , head of the imf delegation , told the reuters news agency that they were demanding that the state-owned gas giant undergo some serious reorganization , adding that the company needed to become more transparent and clean up its finances .
the multibillion euro loan would be part of the imf 's $ 16.4 billion program to help out nations hit hard by the economic crisis. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

always active in the midfield and constantly pushing the offensive , the bremen player extended germany 's lead in the 48th minute with a stunning free kick from 35 metres .

but hrubesch changed his tactics for the finals switching from a 4-4-2 formation to 4-1-4-1 with the duisburg player wagner as sole striker .
" we implemented everything our coach had told us and this made life easy for us , " said ozil , the man of the match .
however , though the result appears crushing , england did have chances with lee cattermole hitting the crossbar in the 58th minute .
winger adam johnson ran on to a ball by james milner and almost flicked the ball into the net with his heel but german defender andreas beck stopped it on the goal line . monday 's victory in the u21 competition gives germany the junior triple after the u17 and u19 teams also took the soccer crowns in their respective european competitions . nk / dpa / ap / reuters / sid / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 dw-tv europe live journal - news with business we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

but some military and political concerns remain . the date june 30 , 2009 may just be another in the continuing struggle for normalcy in iraq but it could prove to be one of the most significant of the country 's recent , blighted history .
on that day , us troops pull back from iraqi cities , leaving iraqi forces to take over control for security operations in urban areas .
the americans believe iraq is ready for such a responsibility but unsurprisingly there are concerns . " from a military and security standpoint it 's time for us to move out of the cities , " general ray odierno , the general in charge of us-led coalition forces told cnn on sunday .
" as for the iraqis , i do believe they are ready , " odierno added .
" they 've been working towards this for a long time .
security remains good ; we 've seen constant improvement in the security forces , constant improvement in governance .
i believe this is the time for them to take ultimate responsibility . " us troops have been pulling out of iraq 's cities before tuesday 's deadline as part of a staged withdrawal over the last eight months and " overall stability in iraq remains good , " general odierno said . iraqi parliamentarians show confidence in home army this feeling of optimism is shared by many iraqi parliamentarians .
liberal shiite representative ayad jamaleldin told deutsche welle that despite the continuing fragility of the war-torn country , he was confident that the iraqi armed forces would be able to protect the country 's citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi security forces have the trust of many politicians " of course , the iraqi armed forces are in a position to guarantee the security of the cities , " he said .
" they are even more effective than the multinational troops , because they can identify the different factions faster and better .
in addition , they are more knowledgeable and better suited to deal with geographical factors . " sunni representative shadha al abussi agreed .
" we have much confidence in our own troops , " he told dw .
" i believe , if each citizen could contribute to the control of the situation in iraq , we could record even greater successes . " iraqi security services say they will meet the us withdrawal with their biggest deployment of troops and policemen in the six years since the us-led invasion of the country .
some 120,000 additional soldiers and police will be deployed to baghdad alone , and thousands of others will be deployed to other cities . despite a spasm of violence including bombings that have killed more than 100 people this month alone , us president barack obama and his military are committed to their end-june withdrawal of american troops from iraq 's urban areas as part of a move from a war-like to a diplomatic footing with baghdad . the retreat is in line with last november 's status of forces agreement -lrb- sofa -rrb- , which set out a timetable for a complete us troop withdrawal from iraq by 2011 . us troops to remain " on call " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us forces will operate between cities and on borders nonetheless , analysts said the withdrawal of us combat forces from iraqi cities will be less dramatic than it seems because the military , while less visible , can still intervene if iraqi security forces appeal for help . us forces will " still be conducting significant operations outside of the cities , in the belts of the major cities , and i still believe this will enable us to maintain the current security and stability situation here in iraq , " odierno said . us soldiers will continue to patrol the most conflict-ridden districts of the country outside the cities at the invitation of the iraqi government and patrol borders .
a few will remain in iraqi cities in an advisory capacity . fears over renewed instability in potential power vacuum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear attacks will increase when the us pulls out despite continued us military support , at least for now , the recent bomb attacks and on-going unrest between arab nationalists and kurds in the northern city of mosul have raised concerns about an increase in violence in line with a reduction in us and allied involvement . general odierno blamed the recent attacks on " fractured extremist elements " and suggested that the bombings and unrest were designed to sow the seeds of doubt ahead of the us withdrawal . " they 're trying to use this time frame and this -lrb- pullout -rrb- date to first gain attention for themselves and also to divert attention from the success of the iraqi security forces , " he said , adding that the recent spike in attacks was not a sign of a broader increase of violence across the country . eu involvement in iraq at the mercy of us plans the iraqis and those concerned citizens in regional neighboring countries are not the only ones whose future could be cast into doubt by the partial us pull-out and then its final withdrawal . michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , believes the europeans involved in iraq have much to lose if the us withdrawal leads to an increase in violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's pm nuri al-maliki benefits from eu support " individually , european countries like germany and france have been unwilling to engage in iraq but the eu plays a large , important role in non-direct engagement , " he told deutsche welle .
" the eu is the main financial contributor to un and world bank projects there , it is involved in an energy dialogue and has recently upgraded its technical and co-operation agreement with iraq into a partnership . " the eu knows it can play a strong role in advancing administrative and electoral reforms , " bauer added .
" these are its specific strengths and the eu can help the government through this . " however , bauer said , if the us withdrawal leads to anarchy and civil war , the europeans will be in no position to address the violence . " these latest attacks are attempts by insurgents to stir up new sectarian violence and destabilize the country , " bauer said .
" this was in some ways expected but what is in question is whether the iraqis can govern through this and whether their army can provide protection when the americans go .
if not , all the eu initiatives in iraq will be at risk . " a self-sufficient iraq would welcome more eu aid the us withdrawal could also lead to an increased effort by the eu if stability and security is maintained . " the europeans could step up and play a stronger role by expanding on their specific strengths once the americans are gone , " bauer said .
" this could help iraq 's full transition and also help the stability of the region as the eu has good diplomatic ties with many of the arab states and to a certain degree , iran .
if iraq can govern and protect itself , the eu could become a strong political and diplomatic partner . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : iraq : the rocky road to democracy and stability power struggles at heart of iraq impasse threaten fragile security experts fear integration of former insurgents threatens iraq 's security iraq 's elections will feature less us presence , but more concerns iraq at a crossroads : a return to chaos or are better times ahead ? iraq -pipe- 29.06.2009 current optimism belies deeper concerns over us withdrawals from iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops will pull back to the countryside from urban areas the us is confident that iraqi security forces are ready to take over responsibility for the country 's cities when american troops pull back to surrounding areas .
but some military and political concerns remain . the date june 30 , 2009 may just be another in the continuing struggle for normalcy in iraq but it could prove to be one of the most significant of the country 's recent , blighted history .
on that day , us troops pull back from iraqi cities , leaving iraqi forces to take over control for security operations in urban areas .
the americans believe iraq is ready for such a responsibility but unsurprisingly there are concerns . " from a military and security standpoint it 's time for us to move out of the cities , " general ray odierno , the general in charge of us-led coalition forces told cnn on sunday .
" as for the iraqis , i do believe they are ready , " odierno added .
" they 've been working towards this for a long time .
security remains good ; we 've seen constant improvement in the security forces , constant improvement in governance .
i believe this is the time for them to take ultimate responsibility . " us troops have been pulling out of iraq 's cities before tuesday 's deadline as part of a staged withdrawal over the last eight months and " overall stability in iraq remains good , " general odierno said . iraqi parliamentarians show confidence in home army this feeling of optimism is shared by many iraqi parliamentarians .
liberal shiite representative ayad jamaleldin told deutsche welle that despite the continuing fragility of the war-torn country , he was confident that the iraqi armed forces would be able to protect the country 's citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi security forces have the trust of many politicians " of course , the iraqi armed forces are in a position to guarantee the security of the cities , " he said .
" they are even more effective than the multinational troops , because they can identify the different factions faster and better .
in addition , they are more knowledgeable and better suited to deal with geographical factors . " sunni representative shadha al abussi agreed .
" we have much confidence in our own troops , " he told dw .
" i believe , if each citizen could contribute to the control of the situation in iraq , we could record even greater successes . " iraqi security services say they will meet the us withdrawal with their biggest deployment of troops and policemen in the six years since the us-led invasion of the country .
some 120,000 additional soldiers and police will be deployed to baghdad alone , and thousands of others will be deployed to other cities . despite a spasm of violence including bombings that have killed more than 100 people this month alone , us president barack obama and his military are committed to their end-june withdrawal of american troops from iraq 's urban areas as part of a move from a war-like to a diplomatic footing with baghdad . the retreat is in line with last november 's status of forces agreement -lrb- sofa -rrb- , which set out a timetable for a complete us troop withdrawal from iraq by 2011 . us troops to remain " on call " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us forces will operate between cities and on borders nonetheless , analysts said the withdrawal of us combat forces from iraqi cities will be less dramatic than it seems because the military , while less visible , can still intervene if iraqi security forces appeal for help . us forces will " still be conducting significant operations outside of the cities , in the belts of the major cities , and i still believe this will enable us to maintain the current security and stability situation here in iraq , " odierno said . us soldiers will continue to patrol the most conflict-ridden districts of the country outside the cities at the invitation of the iraqi government and patrol borders .
a few will remain in iraqi cities in an advisory capacity . fears over renewed instability in potential power vacuum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear attacks will increase when the us pulls out despite continued us military support , at least for now , the recent bomb attacks and on-going unrest between arab nationalists and kurds in the northern city of mosul have raised concerns about an increase in violence in line with a reduction in us and allied involvement . general odierno blamed the recent attacks on " fractured extremist elements " and suggested that the bombings and unrest were designed to sow the seeds of doubt ahead of the us withdrawal . " they 're trying to use this time frame and this -lrb- pullout -rrb- date to first gain attention for themselves and also to divert attention from the success of the iraqi security forces , " he said , adding that the recent spike in attacks was not a sign of a broader increase of violence across the country . eu involvement in iraq at the mercy of us plans the iraqis and those concerned citizens in regional neighboring countries are not the only ones whose future could be cast into doubt by the partial us pull-out and then its final withdrawal . michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , believes the europeans involved in iraq have much to lose if the us withdrawal leads to an increase in violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's pm nuri al-maliki benefits from eu support " individually , european countries like germany and france have been unwilling to engage in iraq but the eu plays a large , important role in non-direct engagement , " he told deutsche welle .
" the eu is the main financial contributor to un and world bank projects there , it is involved in an energy dialogue and has recently upgraded its technical and co-operation agreement with iraq into a partnership . " the eu knows it can play a strong role in advancing administrative and electoral reforms , " bauer added .
" these are its specific strengths and the eu can help the government through this . " however , bauer said , if the us withdrawal leads to anarchy and civil war , the europeans will be in no position to address the violence . " these latest attacks are attempts by insurgents to stir up new sectarian violence and destabilize the country , " bauer said .
" this was in some ways expected but what is in question is whether the iraqis can govern through this and whether their army can provide protection when the americans go .
if not , all the eu initiatives in iraq will be at risk . " a self-sufficient iraq would welcome more eu aid the us withdrawal could also lead to an increased effort by the eu if stability and security is maintained . " the europeans could step up and play a stronger role by expanding on their specific strengths once the americans are gone , " bauer said .
" this could help iraq 's full transition and also help the stability of the region as the eu has good diplomatic ties with many of the arab states and to a certain degree , iran .
if iraq can govern and protect itself , the eu could become a strong political and diplomatic partner . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

always active in the midfield and constantly pushing the offensive , the bremen player extended germany 's lead in the 48th minute with a stunning free kick from 35 metres .
second league striker sandro wagner rounded off germany 's impressive victory towards the end of the second half with a double . germany 's golden generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach horst hrubesch changed his tactics against england " we did everything right and the team deserves great praise .
it was simply fun to watch , " said hrubesch , who was european champion with germany in 1980 .
germany had already faced england coached by stuart pearce in the group phase without achieving more than a meagre 1:1 .
but hrubesch changed his tactics for the finals switching from a 4-4-2 formation to 4-1-4-1 with the duisburg player wagner as sole striker .
" we implemented everything our coach had told us and this made life easy for us , " said ozil , the man of the match .
however , though the result appears crushing , england did have chances with lee cattermole hitting the crossbar in the 58th minute .
winger adam johnson ran on to a ball by james milner and almost flicked the ball into the net with his heel but german defender andreas beck stopped it on the goal line . monday 's victory in the u21 competition gives germany the junior triple after the u17 and u19 teams also took the soccer crowns in their respective european competitions . nk / dpa / ap / reuters / sid / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

always active in the midfield and constantly pushing the offensive , the bremen player extended germany 's lead in the 48th minute with a stunning free kick from 35 metres .
second league striker sandro wagner rounded off germany 's impressive victory towards the end of the second half with a double . germany 's golden generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coach horst hrubesch changed his tactics against england " we did everything right and the team deserves great praise .
it was simply fun to watch , " said hrubesch , who was european champion with germany in 1980 .
germany had already faced england coached by stuart pearce in the group phase without achieving more than a meagre 1:1 .
but hrubesch changed his tactics for the finals switching from a 4-4-2 formation to 4-1-4-1 with the duisburg player wagner as sole striker .
" we implemented everything our coach had told us and this made life easy for us , " said ozil , the man of the match .
however , though the result appears crushing , england did have chances with lee cattermole hitting the crossbar in the 58th minute .
winger adam johnson ran on to a ball by james milner and almost flicked the ball into the net with his heel but german defender andreas beck stopped it on the goal line . monday 's victory in the u21 competition gives germany the junior triple after the u17 and u19 teams also took the soccer crowns in their respective european competitions . nk / dpa / ap / reuters / sid / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the vatican wants to open the sarcophagus and conduct further tests . the marble coffin in rome 's st. paul 's basilica has never been opened , but , according to tests conducted thus far , the tomb contains pieces of human bone that have been dated to the time of saint paul . pope benedict shared the findings sunday at a service outside the church marking the end of the vatican 's pauline year in honor of the apostle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tomb in st. paul 's basilica has been sealed for some five centuries carbon dating showed that the bone fragments belonged to someone who lived between the first and the second century ad , the pontiff said . " this seems to confirm the unanimous and uncontested tradition that they are the mortal remains of the apostle paul , " added benedict . paul - born saul - had actively persecuted christians , but converted after seeing jesus in a vision while on the road to damascus . he is believed to have been beheaded in the year 67 in rome after years of travel as an early missionary to spread the message of jesus . archeologists collected the bone fragments by inserting a probe through a small hole in the tomb , which is located under the basilica 's main altar . bits of incense , purple linen with gold sequins and blue linen were also found , said the pope . though the findings had been known for more than a year , the vatican waited for benedict to make the official announcement .
he is likely to approve further tests and the opening of the tomb . kjb / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the talks , hosted by the european commission , are taking place less than a week before kiev will be expected to hand over three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to russia for gas that it has started to store for the coming winter .
a dispute over payment earlier this year led to russia shutting off gas supplies to ukraine , which affected not only citizens there , but also those living in parts of the european union which depend on gas coming from pipelines running through ukraine .

the talks , hosted by the european commission , are taking place less than a week before kiev will be expected to hand over three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to russia for gas that it has started to store for the coming winter .
a dispute over payment earlier this year led to russia shutting off gas supplies to ukraine , which affected not only citizens there , but also those living in parts of the european union which depend on gas coming from pipelines running through ukraine .
a quarter of all the natural gas burned within the eu comes from russia , with 80 percent of that flowing through ukraine , mostly to the south-eastern corner of the continent .

however , many organizations , including the imf , are n't convinced that naftogaz is in a position to receive funding .
ceyla pazarbasioglu , head of the imf delegation , told the reuters news agency that they were demanding that the state-owned gas giant undergo some serious reorganization , adding that the company needed to become more transparent and clean up its finances .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 29.06.2009 in caucasus , eu monitors must deal with tensions alone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are warning of volatility in the separatist regions in the conflict-prone caucasus , concern is mounting about a security vacuum following the end of the un and osce 's observer missions .
just 200 eu monitors are left , and they 're facing a volatile situation . territorial tensions in the caucasus have a long and tangled history , but since the break-up of the soviet union , russia and georgia have been repeatedly at odds over the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's not surprising , then , that several international observer and military missions have been active in the region . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has had a mission in georgia since 1992 to promote negotiations between conflicting parties and reach a peaceful political settlement .
in 1993 , the united nations created unomig , a military observer mission to verify compliance with a 1993 ceasefire agreement between georgian and abkhaz authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce 's mandate expires on june 30 tensions again came to a head in august 2008 when georgia launched a short but bloody attack on south ossetia .
russia , which has long supported the province 's claims to independence , responded by pouring thousands of troops into south ossetia .
georgian troops were forced out of south ossetia and abkhazia in a matter of days , with russian troops also occupying parts of georgia . under the ceasefire brokered with the help of then-eu president nicolas sarkozy , russia agreed to pull its troops back into south ossetia and abkhazia , but was repeatedly accused by western nations of failing to abide by the truce deal .
adding fuel to the fire , russia officially recognized the independence of the breakaway provinces , a move strongly condemned by the west , which maintains that the provinces are part of georgia . osce mandate expires june 30 as a result , the european union sent a team of 200 observers to georgia to monitor compliance with the six-point ceasefire agreement .
their one-year mandate began on oct.1 , 2008 . the eu monitors had been working in close cooperation with the osce and un missions , but now , the situation has changed dramatically . bildunterschrift : the osce 's main mission to georgia expired at the end of 2008 , but the organization continued to be represented by 20 unarmed military monitors on a mandate that expires on june 30 .
russia has scuppered negotiations on extending their mandate , and has denied them access to south ossetia since the war . earlier this month , russia also vetoed the extension of the un mission in georgia .
the un team had been monitoring the ceasefire along the border between georgia and abkhazia since the end of the war . un mission head johan verbeke said russia 's veto would undermine stability in abkhazia , leaving some 60,000 ethnic georgians there unprotected . " we 've contributed to ensuring that the population in abkhazia had a secure environment in which to operate , " verbeke told deutsche welle .
" i think this mission did effectively contribute to peace and security . " veil of secrecy now , that hard-won security is at stake .
with the departure of the osce and un observers , the eu has been left alone with around 200 monitors , who are unable to enter either south ossetia or abkhazia . " in sum , russia has blinded the international community to what it is doing in the occupied georgian territories , " david j. smith , director of the georgian security analysis center wrote on georgiandaily.com , an independent english-language website based in new york .
" behind its veil of secrecy , russia can continue to strengthen military logistics , perhaps preparing another armed attack on the rest of georgia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is concerned about russia 's activities in south ossetia in a recent briefing , the international crisis group , a brussels-based think tank , also expressed its view that " the lack of an effective security regime in and around the conflict zones of south ossetia and abkhazia create a dangerous atmosphere in which extensive fighting could again erupt . " crisis group called on russia to " re-engage fully in discussions with the security council " in order to move past its june 15 veto and find a continued role for the un in georgia .
it also called on the eu and other international organizations to invest the eu mission with an expanded role to address the situation on the ground . the head of the eu mission , joerg haber , is nonetheless confident that his team will be able to carry out its task of furthering stability in the region and patrolling the border to south ossetia , despite the loss of the osce and un observers . " we have enough people and vehicles to patrol the area and continue our work , " haber told deutsche welle .
" our mandate is not the same as those of the osce and the un .
the osce had broader powers than us , and the un mission was mainly a mission of military observers .

just 200 eu monitors are left , and they 're facing a volatile situation . territorial tensions in the caucasus have a long and tangled history , but since the break-up of the soviet union , russia and georgia have been repeatedly at odds over the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
it 's not surprising , then , that several international observer and military missions have been active in the region . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- has had a mission in georgia since 1992 to promote negotiations between conflicting parties and reach a peaceful political settlement .
in 1993 , the united nations created unomig , a military observer mission to verify compliance with a 1993 ceasefire agreement between georgian and abkhaz authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce 's mandate expires on june 30 tensions again came to a head in august 2008 when georgia launched a short but bloody attack on south ossetia .
russia , which has long supported the province 's claims to independence , responded by pouring thousands of troops into south ossetia .
georgian troops were forced out of south ossetia and abkhazia in a matter of days , with russian troops also occupying parts of georgia . under the ceasefire brokered with the help of then-eu president nicolas sarkozy , russia agreed to pull its troops back into south ossetia and abkhazia , but was repeatedly accused by western nations of failing to abide by the truce deal .
adding fuel to the fire , russia officially recognized the independence of the breakaway provinces , a move strongly condemned by the west , which maintains that the provinces are part of georgia . osce mandate expires june 30 as a result , the european union sent a team of 200 observers to georgia to monitor compliance with the six-point ceasefire agreement .
their one-year mandate began on oct.1 , 2008 . the eu monitors had been working in close cooperation with the osce and un missions , but now , the situation has changed dramatically . bildunterschrift : the osce 's main mission to georgia expired at the end of 2008 , but the organization continued to be represented by 20 unarmed military monitors on a mandate that expires on june 30 .
russia has scuppered negotiations on extending their mandate , and has denied them access to south ossetia since the war . earlier this month , russia also vetoed the extension of the un mission in georgia .
the un team had been monitoring the ceasefire along the border between georgia and abkhazia since the end of the war . un mission head johan verbeke said russia 's veto would undermine stability in abkhazia , leaving some 60,000 ethnic georgians there unprotected . " we 've contributed to ensuring that the population in abkhazia had a secure environment in which to operate , " verbeke told deutsche welle .
" i think this mission did effectively contribute to peace and security . " veil of secrecy now , that hard-won security is at stake .
with the departure of the osce and un observers , the eu has been left alone with around 200 monitors , who are unable to enter either south ossetia or abkhazia . " in sum , russia has blinded the international community to what it is doing in the occupied georgian territories , " david j. smith , director of the georgian security analysis center wrote on georgiandaily.com , an independent english-language website based in new york .

the wirtschaftswoche magazine reports that amazon boss jeff bezos has been unable to strike a deal with the main wireless companies in germany , t-mobile and vodafone .
they want to charge more money for access to their networks than amazon is willing to accept .
the wireless connection is vital for amazon 's electronic book-device because it downloads its content from the internet .
the gadget , which lets you download everything from books to magazines to newspaper subscriptions , is a big hit in the united states , where a third generation model is already available .
a competing product , the sony reader , arrived in germany three months ago , but is a little less convenient because users must connect it to the internet via a computer every time they want new content. nw / dpa editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some military and political concerns remain . the date june 30 , 2009 may just be another in the continuing struggle for normalcy in iraq but it could prove to be one of the most significant of the country 's recent , blighted history .
on that day , us troops pull back from iraqi cities , leaving iraqi forces to take over control for security operations in urban areas .
the americans believe iraq is ready for such a responsibility but unsurprisingly there are concerns . " from a military and security standpoint it 's time for us to move out of the cities , " general ray odierno , the general in charge of us-led coalition forces told cnn on sunday .
" as for the iraqis , i do believe they are ready , " odierno added .
" they 've been working towards this for a long time .
security remains good ; we 've seen constant improvement in the security forces , constant improvement in governance .
i believe this is the time for them to take ultimate responsibility . " us troops have been pulling out of iraq 's cities before tuesday 's deadline as part of a staged withdrawal over the last eight months and " overall stability in iraq remains good , " general odierno said . iraqi parliamentarians show confidence in home army this feeling of optimism is shared by many iraqi parliamentarians .
liberal shiite representative ayad jamaleldin told deutsche welle that despite the continuing fragility of the war-torn country , he was confident that the iraqi armed forces would be able to protect the country 's citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi security forces have the trust of many politicians " of course , the iraqi armed forces are in a position to guarantee the security of the cities , " he said .
" they are even more effective than the multinational troops , because they can identify the different factions faster and better .
in addition , they are more knowledgeable and better suited to deal with geographical factors . " sunni representative shadha al abussi agreed .
" we have much confidence in our own troops , " he told dw .
" i believe , if each citizen could contribute to the control of the situation in iraq , we could record even greater successes . " iraqi security services say they will meet the us withdrawal with their biggest deployment of troops and policemen in the six years since the us-led invasion of the country .
some 120,000 additional soldiers and police will be deployed to baghdad alone , and thousands of others will be deployed to other cities . despite a spasm of violence including bombings that have killed more than 100 people this month alone , us president barack obama and his military are committed to their end-june withdrawal of american troops from iraq 's urban areas as part of a move from a war-like to a diplomatic footing with baghdad . the retreat is in line with last november 's status of forces agreement -lrb- sofa -rrb- , which set out a timetable for a complete us troop withdrawal from iraq by 2011 . us troops to remain " on call " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us forces will operate between cities and on borders nonetheless , analysts said the withdrawal of us combat forces from iraqi cities will be less dramatic than it seems because the military , while less visible , can still intervene if iraqi security forces appeal for help . us forces will " still be conducting significant operations outside of the cities , in the belts of the major cities , and i still believe this will enable us to maintain the current security and stability situation here in iraq , " odierno said . us soldiers will continue to patrol the most conflict-ridden districts of the country outside the cities at the invitation of the iraqi government and patrol borders .
a few will remain in iraqi cities in an advisory capacity . fears over renewed instability in potential power vacuum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear attacks will increase when the us pulls out despite continued us military support , at least for now , the recent bomb attacks and on-going unrest between arab nationalists and kurds in the northern city of mosul have raised concerns about an increase in violence in line with a reduction in us and allied involvement . general odierno blamed the recent attacks on " fractured extremist elements " and suggested that the bombings and unrest were designed to sow the seeds of doubt ahead of the us withdrawal . " they 're trying to use this time frame and this -lrb- pullout -rrb- date to first gain attention for themselves and also to divert attention from the success of the iraqi security forces , " he said , adding that the recent spike in attacks was not a sign of a broader increase of violence across the country . eu involvement in iraq at the mercy of us plans the iraqis and those concerned citizens in regional neighboring countries are not the only ones whose future could be cast into doubt by the partial us pull-out and then its final withdrawal . michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , believes the europeans involved in iraq have much to lose if the us withdrawal leads to an increase in violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's pm nuri al-maliki benefits from eu support " individually , european countries like germany and france have been unwilling to engage in iraq but the eu plays a large , important role in non-direct engagement , " he told deutsche welle .
" the eu is the main financial contributor to un and world bank projects there , it is involved in an energy dialogue and has recently upgraded its technical and co-operation agreement with iraq into a partnership . " the eu knows it can play a strong role in advancing administrative and electoral reforms , " bauer added .
" these are its specific strengths and the eu can help the government through this . " however , bauer said , if the us withdrawal leads to anarchy and civil war , the europeans will be in no position to address the violence . " these latest attacks are attempts by insurgents to stir up new sectarian violence and destabilize the country , " bauer said .
" this was in some ways expected but what is in question is whether the iraqis can govern through this and whether their army can provide protection when the americans go .
if not , all the eu initiatives in iraq will be at risk . " a self-sufficient iraq would welcome more eu aid the us withdrawal could also lead to an increased effort by the eu if stability and security is maintained . " the europeans could step up and play a stronger role by expanding on their specific strengths once the americans are gone , " bauer said .
" this could help iraq 's full transition and also help the stability of the region as the eu has good diplomatic ties with many of the arab states and to a certain degree , iran .
if iraq can govern and protect itself , the eu could become a strong political and diplomatic partner . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on that day , us troops pull back from iraqi cities , leaving iraqi forces to take over control for security operations in urban areas .
the americans believe iraq is ready for such a responsibility but unsurprisingly there are concerns . " from a military and security standpoint it 's time for us to move out of the cities , " general ray odierno , the general in charge of us-led coalition forces told cnn on sunday .
" as for the iraqis , i do believe they are ready , " odierno added .
" they 've been working towards this for a long time .
security remains good ; we 've seen constant improvement in the security forces , constant improvement in governance .
i believe this is the time for them to take ultimate responsibility . " us troops have been pulling out of iraq 's cities before tuesday 's deadline as part of a staged withdrawal over the last eight months and " overall stability in iraq remains good , " general odierno said . iraqi parliamentarians show confidence in home army this feeling of optimism is shared by many iraqi parliamentarians .
liberal shiite representative ayad jamaleldin told deutsche welle that despite the continuing fragility of the war-torn country , he was confident that the iraqi armed forces would be able to protect the country 's citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi security forces have the trust of many politicians " of course , the iraqi armed forces are in a position to guarantee the security of the cities , " he said .
" they are even more effective than the multinational troops , because they can identify the different factions faster and better .
in addition , they are more knowledgeable and better suited to deal with geographical factors . " sunni representative shadha al abussi agreed .
" we have much confidence in our own troops , " he told dw .
" i believe , if each citizen could contribute to the control of the situation in iraq , we could record even greater successes . " iraqi security services say they will meet the us withdrawal with their biggest deployment of troops and policemen in the six years since the us-led invasion of the country .
some 120,000 additional soldiers and police will be deployed to baghdad alone , and thousands of others will be deployed to other cities . despite a spasm of violence including bombings that have killed more than 100 people this month alone , us president barack obama and his military are committed to their end-june withdrawal of american troops from iraq 's urban areas as part of a move from a war-like to a diplomatic footing with baghdad . the retreat is in line with last november 's status of forces agreement -lrb- sofa -rrb- , which set out a timetable for a complete us troop withdrawal from iraq by 2011 . us troops to remain " on call " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us forces will operate between cities and on borders nonetheless , analysts said the withdrawal of us combat forces from iraqi cities will be less dramatic than it seems because the military , while less visible , can still intervene if iraqi security forces appeal for help . us forces will " still be conducting significant operations outside of the cities , in the belts of the major cities , and i still believe this will enable us to maintain the current security and stability situation here in iraq , " odierno said . us soldiers will continue to patrol the most conflict-ridden districts of the country outside the cities at the invitation of the iraqi government and patrol borders .
a few will remain in iraqi cities in an advisory capacity . fears over renewed instability in potential power vacuum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear attacks will increase when the us pulls out despite continued us military support , at least for now , the recent bomb attacks and on-going unrest between arab nationalists and kurds in the northern city of mosul have raised concerns about an increase in violence in line with a reduction in us and allied involvement . general odierno blamed the recent attacks on " fractured extremist elements " and suggested that the bombings and unrest were designed to sow the seeds of doubt ahead of the us withdrawal . " they 're trying to use this time frame and this -lrb- pullout -rrb- date to first gain attention for themselves and also to divert attention from the success of the iraqi security forces , " he said , adding that the recent spike in attacks was not a sign of a broader increase of violence across the country . eu involvement in iraq at the mercy of us plans the iraqis and those concerned citizens in regional neighboring countries are not the only ones whose future could be cast into doubt by the partial us pull-out and then its final withdrawal . michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , believes the europeans involved in iraq have much to lose if the us withdrawal leads to an increase in violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's pm nuri al-maliki benefits from eu support " individually , european countries like germany and france have been unwilling to engage in iraq but the eu plays a large , important role in non-direct engagement , " he told deutsche welle .
" the eu is the main financial contributor to un and world bank projects there , it is involved in an energy dialogue and has recently upgraded its technical and co-operation agreement with iraq into a partnership . " the eu knows it can play a strong role in advancing administrative and electoral reforms , " bauer added .
" these are its specific strengths and the eu can help the government through this . " however , bauer said , if the us withdrawal leads to anarchy and civil war , the europeans will be in no position to address the violence . " these latest attacks are attempts by insurgents to stir up new sectarian violence and destabilize the country , " bauer said .
" this was in some ways expected but what is in question is whether the iraqis can govern through this and whether their army can provide protection when the americans go .
if not , all the eu initiatives in iraq will be at risk . " a self-sufficient iraq would welcome more eu aid the us withdrawal could also lead to an increased effort by the eu if stability and security is maintained . " the europeans could step up and play a stronger role by expanding on their specific strengths once the americans are gone , " bauer said .
" this could help iraq 's full transition and also help the stability of the region as the eu has good diplomatic ties with many of the arab states and to a certain degree , iran .

the wirtschaftswoche magazine reports that amazon boss jeff bezos has been unable to strike a deal with the main wireless companies in germany , t-mobile and vodafone .
they want to charge more money for access to their networks than amazon is willing to accept .
the wireless connection is vital for amazon 's electronic book-device because it downloads its content from the internet .
the gadget , which lets you download everything from books to magazines to newspaper subscriptions , is a big hit in the united states , where a third generation model is already available .
a competing product , the sony reader , arrived in germany three months ago , but is a little less convenient because users must connect it to the internet via a computer every time they want new content. nw / dpa editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first batch of handsets that are n't tied to a particular charging device should hit the market in 2010 . europe 's avid mobile phone-users will soon be able to empty their drawers of the familiar tangle of chargers after leading manufacturers agreed on an industry standard . major mobile manufacturers , including apple , lg , motorola , nokia , samsung , sony ericsson und texas instruments , signed a deal on monday agreeing to a standard charger for all the cell phones they produce , the european commission said . a single , standard charger will cut costs to manufacturers and reduce the number of chargers thrown away when consumers buy new phones , eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said , adding that he wanted to see the common charger expanded to include other older phones , cameras and laptops in the years ahead . " i am very pleased that industry has found an agreement , which will make life much simpler for consumers , " verheugen said .
the commissioner had threatened to pass legislation on the issue if the industry failed to come up with a voluntary deal . non-binding agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older phones wo n't be covered by the new agreement phone-makers decided to use the currently available micro-usb plug for the mobiles they produce in the future .
the deal also means the creation of an eu norm for new mobile phones . manufacturers originally developed different chargers to match their batteries , since those that were not charged correctly run the risk of exploding . the mobile industry said the number of chargers produced every year could be cut in half when the new agreement goes into effect .
it is estimated that tons of trash pile into landfills every year as consumers throw away chargers when switching cell phones . the eu represents the world 's biggest market for mobile phones , with between 350 and 400 million currently in operation and some 185 million new ones sold each year . monday 's agreement is , however , not legally binding . sms / dpa / ap / retuers editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german company is on the brink of collapse and has said it urgently needs government aid to stay in business . for quelle , there are still hopes that disaster can be avoided .
the head of the company , konrad hilbers , on monday morning urged the government in berlin to decide in favor of the mail-order house and to grant a government loan that would bail the company at least out of its most urgent troubles . " there still is a way to avoid bankruptcy , " he said .
" we need to those discussions and urgently should get some positive results from berlin . " last wednesday , a committee of federal and state finance ministers considered extending quelle up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- worth of loans . the decision on whether or not the loan will be granted is expected to come monday evening after yet another meeting of the inter-ministerial committee . so far , chancellor angela merkel had been rather reluctant to rush to the rescue of quelle , defended her government 's reticence by pointing to the european union 's competition rules . " we have to let the eu in on the whole process , " she said , adding that nobody would benefit if the eu ruled against any state-loans after they had already been made . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer is concerned about the impact of job cuts in his state but the bavarian csu – sister party to merkel ’ s conservative cdu – over the weekend stepped up the pressure on berlin to rule in favor of quelle .
state premier horst seehofer , raised the stakes on sunday , june 28 , accusing his fellow conservatives in the federal government of putting thousands of jobs at risk . " jobs are at acute risk , nobody can want this , " seehofer said . what should be done ? the conservative politician demanded that berlin agree to contribute to a package of loans to save quelle , after it emerged on saturday that the company was unable to pay its suppliers and was teetering on the edge of collapse . bavaria , where most of quelle 's 8,000 employees are located , led the charge , pledging 21 million euros in aid .
the state of saxony offeredan additional 4 million euros . but the federal government later said that it wanted quelle to improve its application for assistance and that it would wait until the eu 's competition watchdog in brussels had reviewed the situation before contributing funds . death of a sales concept quelle is a highly symbolic german company , especially among the older generation , and has a mail-order catalogue featuring everything from washing machines to underwear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quelle 's winter catalogue was delivered with borrowed funds last week together with the department store chain karstadt , it is one of the most prominent casualties of the bankruptcy of its parent company arcandor . yet not everyone wants to see it bailed out . henning koopmann , the boss of quelle 's competitor neckermann , said any state rescue for his rival would be " unfair . " " a state-backed loan might save 8,000 jobs at quelle for now , but it would also endanger the 72,000 jobs at other mail-order companies in germany , " he said . bavaria 's opposition social democrats also criticized the regional government , accusing it of conducting a cynical drama on the backs of quelle employees . on saturday , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that quelle transferred all of its cash to its parent arcandor , only hours before that company declared insolvency on june 9 . an arcandor spokesperson later confirmed the report , but said the transfers were automated and not motivated by the insolvency . since then , quelle has been surviving off the kindness of its suppliers , who have suspended their invoices . nw / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german company is on the brink of collapse and has said it urgently needs government aid to stay in business . for quelle , there are still hopes that disaster can be avoided .
the head of the company , konrad hilbers , on monday morning urged the government in berlin to decide in favor of the mail-order house and to grant a government loan that would bail the company at least out of its most urgent troubles . " there still is a way to avoid bankruptcy , " he said .
" we need to those discussions and urgently should get some positive results from berlin . " last wednesday , a committee of federal and state finance ministers considered extending quelle up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- worth of loans . the decision on whether or not the loan will be granted is expected to come monday evening after yet another meeting of the inter-ministerial committee . so far , chancellor angela merkel had been rather reluctant to rush to the rescue of quelle , defended her government 's reticence by pointing to the european union 's competition rules . " we have to let the eu in on the whole process , " she said , adding that nobody would benefit if the eu ruled against any state-loans after they had already been made . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer is concerned about the impact of job cuts in his state but the bavarian csu – sister party to merkel ’ s conservative cdu – over the weekend stepped up the pressure on berlin to rule in favor of quelle .

" " a state-backed loan might save 8,000 jobs at quelle for now , but it would also endanger the 72,000 jobs at other mail-order companies in germany , " he said . bavaria 's opposition social democrats also criticized the regional government , accusing it of conducting a cynical drama on the backs of quelle employees . on saturday , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that quelle transferred all of its cash to its parent arcandor , only hours before that company declared insolvency on june 9 . an arcandor spokesperson later confirmed the report , but said the transfers were automated and not motivated by the insolvency . since then , quelle has been surviving off the kindness of its suppliers , who have suspended their invoices . nw / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.06.2009 merkel makes tax cuts into her pitch for re-election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is personally popular , but her party still only polls 35 percent in 90 days germans elect a new government .
chancellor angela merkel has promised tax cuts to secure her party 's re-election , but rivals from left to right are attacking her program as unrealistic . germany 's conservatives have kicked off their election campaign with an explicit appeal to the middle-class .
" we want to relieve the burden on the middle of society , " said christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- general secretary , ronald pofalla , at the opening of the party conference in berlin on monday .
pofalla attacked his party 's main rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , accusing them of pursuing a strategy of " division and envy . "
" we want to reduce taxes , the spd wants to raise them .
we will make this abundantly clear over the next three months , " he said .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu agreed at the weekend that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign .
the main policy would be a modest cut in the lowest income tax bracket from 14 to 12 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier guenther oettinger has called for a rise in sales tax dissent in the ranks but there have been opposing voices among the conservatives .
two cdu state premiers have openly advocated an increase in certain taxes , such as value added tax , to offset the blowout in public expenditures caused by the global economic downturn .
so it was with an eye to the dissenters that chancellor merkel called for party unity when she took to the stage at the party conference , to the drawn-out applause of over 750 party deputies .
" sometimes a bit of lateral thinking is needed , " she said , in a veiled reference to her party 's internal tax-debate , " but we 've thought for long enough . "
merkel vowed , if re-elected , not to raise value added tax during the next term of office , but did n't elaborate on how her tax-cuts would be financed or when they would be introduced .
she also advocated her party 's goal of winning enough votes to ditch the spd as coalition partner in favour of the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we have the power to make our country stronger than it was before .
we have the power to promote growth ... and we say , we can best do this with a different coalition partner , " she said .
criticism from left and right the social democrats ' secretary-general , hubertus heil , said the cdu 's agenda " was not credible . "
he warned that " merkel is either trying to pull the wool over the voter 's eyes , or there really is no sound concept behind the whole thing . "
heil said that the cdu 's election program did not contain ideas on how to shape the country 's future .
with the country 's budget set for a record deficit , any promise to lower taxes was simply " unrealistic . "
criticism also came from the fdp - normally a strong advocate for tax cuts .

chancellor angela merkel has promised tax cuts to secure her party 's re-election , but rivals from left to right are attacking her program as unrealistic . germany 's conservatives have kicked off their election campaign with an explicit appeal to the middle-class .
" we want to relieve the burden on the middle of society , " said christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- general secretary , ronald pofalla , at the opening of the party conference in berlin on monday .
pofalla attacked his party 's main rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , accusing them of pursuing a strategy of " division and envy . "
" we want to reduce taxes , the spd wants to raise them .
we will make this abundantly clear over the next three months , " he said .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu agreed at the weekend that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign .
the main policy would be a modest cut in the lowest income tax bracket from 14 to 12 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier guenther oettinger has called for a rise in sales tax dissent in the ranks but there have been opposing voices among the conservatives .
two cdu state premiers have openly advocated an increase in certain taxes , such as value added tax , to offset the blowout in public expenditures caused by the global economic downturn .
so it was with an eye to the dissenters that chancellor merkel called for party unity when she took to the stage at the party conference , to the drawn-out applause of over 750 party deputies .
" sometimes a bit of lateral thinking is needed , " she said , in a veiled reference to her party 's internal tax-debate , " but we 've thought for long enough . "
merkel vowed , if re-elected , not to raise value added tax during the next term of office , but did n't elaborate on how her tax-cuts would be financed or when they would be introduced .
she also advocated her party 's goal of winning enough votes to ditch the spd as coalition partner in favour of the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we have the power to make our country stronger than it was before .
we have the power to promote growth ... and we say , we can best do this with a different coalition partner , " she said .
criticism from left and right the social democrats ' secretary-general , hubertus heil , said the cdu 's agenda " was not credible . "
he warned that " merkel is either trying to pull the wool over the voter 's eyes , or there really is no sound concept behind the whole thing . "
heil said that the cdu 's election program did not contain ideas on how to shape the country 's future .
with the country 's budget set for a record deficit , any promise to lower taxes was simply " unrealistic . "
criticism also came from the fdp - normally a strong advocate for tax cuts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.06.2009 merkel makes tax cuts into her pitch for re-election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is personally popular , but her party still only polls 35 percent in 90 days germans elect a new government .
chancellor angela merkel has promised tax cuts to secure her party 's re-election , but rivals from left to right are attacking her program as unrealistic . germany 's conservatives have kicked off their election campaign with an explicit appeal to the middle-class .
" we want to relieve the burden on the middle of society , " said christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- general secretary , ronald pofalla , at the opening of the party conference in berlin on monday .
pofalla attacked his party 's main rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , accusing them of pursuing a strategy of " division and envy . "
" we want to reduce taxes , the spd wants to raise them .
we will make this abundantly clear over the next three months , " he said .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu agreed at the weekend that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign .
the main policy would be a modest cut in the lowest income tax bracket from 14 to 12 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier guenther oettinger has called for a rise in sales tax dissent in the ranks but there have been opposing voices among the conservatives .
two cdu state premiers have openly advocated an increase in certain taxes , such as value added tax , to offset the blowout in public expenditures caused by the global economic downturn .
so it was with an eye to the dissenters that chancellor merkel called for party unity when she took to the stage at the party conference , to the drawn-out applause of over 750 party deputies .
" sometimes a bit of lateral thinking is needed , " she said , in a veiled reference to her party 's internal tax-debate , " but we 've thought for long enough . "
merkel vowed , if re-elected , not to raise value added tax during the next term of office , but did n't elaborate on how her tax-cuts would be financed or when they would be introduced .
she also advocated her party 's goal of winning enough votes to ditch the spd as coalition partner in favour of the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we have the power to make our country stronger than it was before .
we have the power to promote growth ... and we say , we can best do this with a different coalition partner , " she said .
criticism from left and right the social democrats ' secretary-general , hubertus heil , said the cdu 's agenda " was not credible . "
he warned that " merkel is either trying to pull the wool over the voter 's eyes , or there really is no sound concept behind the whole thing . "
heil said that the cdu 's election program did not contain ideas on how to shape the country 's future .
with the country 's budget set for a record deficit , any promise to lower taxes was simply " unrealistic . "
criticism also came from the fdp - normally a strong advocate for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy , set to shrink by six percent , will be a key campaign theme the party 's juergen koppelin criticized the plans as " very vague and non-binding " , calling them " spineless " for not including a timetable to introduce the tax cuts .
but fdp leader , guido westerwelle , welcomed the conservatives ' overtures to form a coalition , calling their program a " good basis " for working together .
in contrast , the greens ' claudia roth , also with an eye on possible coalition talks , said the conservatives ' platform was looking " very distant from us . "
the latest opinion poll puts the conservatives on 35 percent of the vote .
right now , that would be just enough to win government with the fdp , who are polling 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left spd , the minority party in merkel 's government , still hopes to retain power in a second grand coalition .
but its goal of forming government with the greens seems increasingly unlikely .
the two parties are currently polling 24 and 15 percent respectively. nw / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first batch of handsets that are n't tied to a particular charging device should hit the market in 2010 . europe 's avid mobile phone-users will soon be able to empty their drawers of the familiar tangle of chargers after leading manufacturers agreed on an industry standard . major mobile manufacturers , including apple , lg , motorola , nokia , samsung , sony ericsson und texas instruments , signed a deal on monday agreeing to a standard charger for all the cell phones they produce , the european commission said . a single , standard charger will cut costs to manufacturers and reduce the number of chargers thrown away when consumers buy new phones , eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said , adding that he wanted to see the common charger expanded to include other older phones , cameras and laptops in the years ahead . " i am very pleased that industry has found an agreement , which will make life much simpler for consumers , " verheugen said .
the commissioner had threatened to pass legislation on the issue if the industry failed to come up with a voluntary deal . non-binding agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older phones wo n't be covered by the new agreement phone-makers decided to use the currently available micro-usb plug for the mobiles they produce in the future .
the deal also means the creation of an eu norm for new mobile phones . manufacturers originally developed different chargers to match their batteries , since those that were not charged correctly run the risk of exploding . the mobile industry said the number of chargers produced every year could be cut in half when the new agreement goes into effect .
it is estimated that tons of trash pile into landfills every year as consumers throw away chargers when switching cell phones . the eu represents the world 's biggest market for mobile phones , with between 350 and 400 million currently in operation and some 185 million new ones sold each year . monday 's agreement is , however , not legally binding . sms / dpa / ap / retuers editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some military and political concerns remain . the date june 30 , 2009 may just be another in the continuing struggle for normalcy in iraq but it could prove to be one of the most significant of the country 's recent , blighted history .
on that day , us troops pull back from iraqi cities , leaving iraqi forces to take over control for security operations in urban areas .
the americans believe iraq is ready for such a responsibility but unsurprisingly there are concerns . " from a military and security standpoint it 's time for us to move out of the cities , " general ray odierno , the general in charge of us-led coalition forces told cnn on sunday .
" as for the iraqis , i do believe they are ready , " odierno added .
" they 've been working towards this for a long time .
security remains good ; we 've seen constant improvement in the security forces , constant improvement in governance .
i believe this is the time for them to take ultimate responsibility . " us troops have been pulling out of iraq 's cities before tuesday 's deadline as part of a staged withdrawal over the last eight months and " overall stability in iraq remains good , " general odierno said . iraqi parliamentarians show confidence in home army this feeling of optimism is shared by many iraqi parliamentarians .
liberal shiite representative ayad jamaleldin told deutsche welle that despite the continuing fragility of the war-torn country , he was confident that the iraqi armed forces would be able to protect the country 's citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi security forces have the trust of many politicians " of course , the iraqi armed forces are in a position to guarantee the security of the cities , " he said .
" they are even more effective than the multinational troops , because they can identify the different factions faster and better .
in addition , they are more knowledgeable and better suited to deal with geographical factors . " sunni representative shadha al abussi agreed .
" we have much confidence in our own troops , " he told dw .
" i believe , if each citizen could contribute to the control of the situation in iraq , we could record even greater successes . " iraqi security services say they will meet the us withdrawal with their biggest deployment of troops and policemen in the six years since the us-led invasion of the country .
some 120,000 additional soldiers and police will be deployed to baghdad alone , and thousands of others will be deployed to other cities . despite a spasm of violence including bombings that have killed more than 100 people this month alone , us president barack obama and his military are committed to their end-june withdrawal of american troops from iraq 's urban areas as part of a move from a war-like to a diplomatic footing with baghdad . the retreat is in line with last november 's status of forces agreement -lrb- sofa -rrb- , which set out a timetable for a complete us troop withdrawal from iraq by 2011 . us troops to remain " on call " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us forces will operate between cities and on borders nonetheless , analysts said the withdrawal of us combat forces from iraqi cities will be less dramatic than it seems because the military , while less visible , can still intervene if iraqi security forces appeal for help . us forces will " still be conducting significant operations outside of the cities , in the belts of the major cities , and i still believe this will enable us to maintain the current security and stability situation here in iraq , " odierno said . us soldiers will continue to patrol the most conflict-ridden districts of the country outside the cities at the invitation of the iraqi government and patrol borders .
a few will remain in iraqi cities in an advisory capacity . fears over renewed instability in potential power vacuum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear attacks will increase when the us pulls out despite continued us military support , at least for now , the recent bomb attacks and on-going unrest between arab nationalists and kurds in the northern city of mosul have raised concerns about an increase in violence in line with a reduction in us and allied involvement . general odierno blamed the recent attacks on " fractured extremist elements " and suggested that the bombings and unrest were designed to sow the seeds of doubt ahead of the us withdrawal . " they 're trying to use this time frame and this -lrb- pullout -rrb- date to first gain attention for themselves and also to divert attention from the success of the iraqi security forces , " he said , adding that the recent spike in attacks was not a sign of a broader increase of violence across the country . eu involvement in iraq at the mercy of us plans the iraqis and those concerned citizens in regional neighboring countries are not the only ones whose future could be cast into doubt by the partial us pull-out and then its final withdrawal . michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , believes the europeans involved in iraq have much to lose if the us withdrawal leads to an increase in violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's pm nuri al-maliki benefits from eu support " individually , european countries like germany and france have been unwilling to engage in iraq but the eu plays a large , important role in non-direct engagement , " he told deutsche welle .
" the eu is the main financial contributor to un and world bank projects there , it is involved in an energy dialogue and has recently upgraded its technical and co-operation agreement with iraq into a partnership . " the eu knows it can play a strong role in advancing administrative and electoral reforms , " bauer added .
" these are its specific strengths and the eu can help the government through this . " however , bauer said , if the us withdrawal leads to anarchy and civil war , the europeans will be in no position to address the violence . " these latest attacks are attempts by insurgents to stir up new sectarian violence and destabilize the country , " bauer said .
" this was in some ways expected but what is in question is whether the iraqis can govern through this and whether their army can provide protection when the americans go .
if not , all the eu initiatives in iraq will be at risk . " a self-sufficient iraq would welcome more eu aid the us withdrawal could also lead to an increased effort by the eu if stability and security is maintained . " the europeans could step up and play a stronger role by expanding on their specific strengths once the americans are gone , " bauer said .
" this could help iraq 's full transition and also help the stability of the region as the eu has good diplomatic ties with many of the arab states and to a certain degree , iran .
if iraq can govern and protect itself , the eu could become a strong political and diplomatic partner . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first batch of handsets that are n't tied to a particular charging device should hit the market in 2010 . europe 's avid mobile phone-users will soon be able to empty their drawers of the familiar tangle of chargers after leading manufacturers agreed on an industry standard . major mobile manufacturers , including apple , lg , motorola , nokia , samsung , sony ericsson und texas instruments , signed a deal on monday agreeing to a standard charger for all the cell phones they produce , the european commission said . a single , standard charger will cut costs to manufacturers and reduce the number of chargers thrown away when consumers buy new phones , eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said , adding that he wanted to see the common charger expanded to include other older phones , cameras and laptops in the years ahead . " i am very pleased that industry has found an agreement , which will make life much simpler for consumers , " verheugen said .
the commissioner had threatened to pass legislation on the issue if the industry failed to come up with a voluntary deal . non-binding agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older phones wo n't be covered by the new agreement phone-makers decided to use the currently available micro-usb plug for the mobiles they produce in the future .
the deal also means the creation of an eu norm for new mobile phones . manufacturers originally developed different chargers to match their batteries , since those that were not charged correctly run the risk of exploding . the mobile industry said the number of chargers produced every year could be cut in half when the new agreement goes into effect .
it is estimated that tons of trash pile into landfills every year as consumers throw away chargers when switching cell phones . the eu represents the world 's biggest market for mobile phones , with between 350 and 400 million currently in operation and some 185 million new ones sold each year . monday 's agreement is , however , not legally binding . sms / dpa / ap / retuers editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the talks , hosted by the european commission , are taking place less than a week before kiev will be expected to hand over three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to russia for gas that it has started to store for the coming winter .

the talks , hosted by the european commission , are taking place less than a week before kiev will be expected to hand over three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to russia for gas that it has started to store for the coming winter .

however , many organizations , including the imf , are n't convinced that naftogaz is in a position to receive funding .
ceyla pazarbasioglu , head of the imf delegation , told the reuters news agency that they were demanding that the state-owned gas giant undergo some serious reorganization , adding that the company needed to become more transparent and clean up its finances .

the two companies have been arguing for weeks over who will have control after a merger , planned last year when porsche was enjoying a boom in sales , goes through .
over the weekend vw had presented a merger proposition in which it would pay 3 to 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 to 5.6 billion -rrb- for 49.9 percent of porsche ag , which owns the factories and brand .
porsche turned down the deal on monday , with a spokesman for porsche automobil holding se telling journalists it was " not a viable option " , because it would mean that porsche would be required to immediately pay back a 10.75 billion euro credit it had previously gotten from a bank consortium .
porsche se , the family-run owner of the sports carmaker which currently controls 51 percent of volkswagen , racked a debt of 9 billion euros last year through its purchase of vw shares and options .

the paper , quoting sources close to the negotiations , said qia had made clear it would not invest in either porsche or volkswagen separately , but would only invest in a merged group .
" qatar does not want to acquire its stake with a crowbar , against the will of volkswagen and lower saxony , " said a source quoted by handelsblatt .
the state of lower saxony owns just over 20 percent of volkswagen .
the premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , has demanded porsche decide , telling reporters that " all the facts are on the table . "
meanwhile , guenther oettinger , premier of the state of baden-wuerttemberg , in which porsche is based , has taken porsche 's side in the debate , despite the fact that his state does not own any shares in the company , saying that vw should be showing more respect to porsche as its majority shareholder. mrm / dpa / ap / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some military and political concerns remain . the date june 30 , 2009 may just be another in the continuing struggle for normalcy in iraq but it could prove to be one of the most significant of the country 's recent , blighted history .
on that day , us troops pull back from iraqi cities , leaving iraqi forces to take over control for security operations in urban areas .
the americans believe iraq is ready for such a responsibility but unsurprisingly there are concerns . " from a military and security standpoint it 's time for us to move out of the cities , " general ray odierno , the general in charge of us-led coalition forces told cnn on sunday .
" as for the iraqis , i do believe they are ready , " odierno added .
" they 've been working towards this for a long time .
security remains good ; we 've seen constant improvement in the security forces , constant improvement in governance .
i believe this is the time for them to take ultimate responsibility . " us troops have been pulling out of iraq 's cities before tuesday 's deadline as part of a staged withdrawal over the last eight months and " overall stability in iraq remains good , " general odierno said . iraqi parliamentarians show confidence in home army this feeling of optimism is shared by many iraqi parliamentarians .
liberal shiite representative ayad jamaleldin told deutsche welle that despite the continuing fragility of the war-torn country , he was confident that the iraqi armed forces would be able to protect the country 's citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi security forces have the trust of many politicians " of course , the iraqi armed forces are in a position to guarantee the security of the cities , " he said .
" they are even more effective than the multinational troops , because they can identify the different factions faster and better .
in addition , they are more knowledgeable and better suited to deal with geographical factors . " sunni representative shadha al abussi agreed .
" we have much confidence in our own troops , " he told dw .
" i believe , if each citizen could contribute to the control of the situation in iraq , we could record even greater successes . " iraqi security services say they will meet the us withdrawal with their biggest deployment of troops and policemen in the six years since the us-led invasion of the country .
some 120,000 additional soldiers and police will be deployed to baghdad alone , and thousands of others will be deployed to other cities . despite a spasm of violence including bombings that have killed more than 100 people this month alone , us president barack obama and his military are committed to their end-june withdrawal of american troops from iraq 's urban areas as part of a move from a war-like to a diplomatic footing with baghdad . the retreat is in line with last november 's status of forces agreement -lrb- sofa -rrb- , which set out a timetable for a complete us troop withdrawal from iraq by 2011 . us troops to remain " on call " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us forces will operate between cities and on borders nonetheless , analysts said the withdrawal of us combat forces from iraqi cities will be less dramatic than it seems because the military , while less visible , can still intervene if iraqi security forces appeal for help . us forces will " still be conducting significant operations outside of the cities , in the belts of the major cities , and i still believe this will enable us to maintain the current security and stability situation here in iraq , " odierno said . us soldiers will continue to patrol the most conflict-ridden districts of the country outside the cities at the invitation of the iraqi government and patrol borders .
a few will remain in iraqi cities in an advisory capacity . fears over renewed instability in potential power vacuum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear attacks will increase when the us pulls out despite continued us military support , at least for now , the recent bomb attacks and on-going unrest between arab nationalists and kurds in the northern city of mosul have raised concerns about an increase in violence in line with a reduction in us and allied involvement . general odierno blamed the recent attacks on " fractured extremist elements " and suggested that the bombings and unrest were designed to sow the seeds of doubt ahead of the us withdrawal . " they 're trying to use this time frame and this -lrb- pullout -rrb- date to first gain attention for themselves and also to divert attention from the success of the iraqi security forces , " he said , adding that the recent spike in attacks was not a sign of a broader increase of violence across the country . eu involvement in iraq at the mercy of us plans the iraqis and those concerned citizens in regional neighboring countries are not the only ones whose future could be cast into doubt by the partial us pull-out and then its final withdrawal . michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , believes the europeans involved in iraq have much to lose if the us withdrawal leads to an increase in violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's pm nuri al-maliki benefits from eu support " individually , european countries like germany and france have been unwilling to engage in iraq but the eu plays a large , important role in non-direct engagement , " he told deutsche welle .
" the eu is the main financial contributor to un and world bank projects there , it is involved in an energy dialogue and has recently upgraded its technical and co-operation agreement with iraq into a partnership . " the eu knows it can play a strong role in advancing administrative and electoral reforms , " bauer added .
" these are its specific strengths and the eu can help the government through this . " however , bauer said , if the us withdrawal leads to anarchy and civil war , the europeans will be in no position to address the violence . " these latest attacks are attempts by insurgents to stir up new sectarian violence and destabilize the country , " bauer said .
" this was in some ways expected but what is in question is whether the iraqis can govern through this and whether their army can provide protection when the americans go .
if not , all the eu initiatives in iraq will be at risk . " a self-sufficient iraq would welcome more eu aid the us withdrawal could also lead to an increased effort by the eu if stability and security is maintained . " the europeans could step up and play a stronger role by expanding on their specific strengths once the americans are gone , " bauer said .
" this could help iraq 's full transition and also help the stability of the region as the eu has good diplomatic ties with many of the arab states and to a certain degree , iran .
if iraq can govern and protect itself , the eu could become a strong political and diplomatic partner . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the americans believe iraq is ready for such a responsibility but unsurprisingly there are concerns . " from a military and security standpoint it 's time for us to move out of the cities , " general ray odierno , the general in charge of us-led coalition forces told cnn on sunday .
" as for the iraqis , i do believe they are ready , " odierno added .
" they 've been working towards this for a long time .

liberal shiite representative ayad jamaleldin told deutsche welle that despite the continuing fragility of the war-torn country , he was confident that the iraqi armed forces would be able to protect the country 's citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi security forces have the trust of many politicians " of course , the iraqi armed forces are in a position to guarantee the security of the cities , " he said .

" they 're trying to use this time frame and this -lrb- pullout -rrb- date to first gain attention for themselves and also to divert attention from the success of the iraqi security forces , " he said , adding that the recent spike in attacks was not a sign of a broader increase of violence across the country . eu involvement in iraq at the mercy of us plans the iraqis and those concerned citizens in regional neighboring countries are not the only ones whose future could be cast into doubt by the partial us pull-out and then its final withdrawal . michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , believes the europeans involved in iraq have much to lose if the us withdrawal leads to an increase in violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's pm nuri al-maliki benefits from eu support " individually , european countries like germany and france have been unwilling to engage in iraq but the eu plays a large , important role in non-direct engagement , " he told deutsche welle .

" these are its specific strengths and the eu can help the government through this .

" these latest attacks are attempts by insurgents to stir up new sectarian violence and destabilize the country , " bauer said .
" this was in some ways expected but what is in question is whether the iraqis can govern through this and whether their army can provide protection when the americans go .
if not , all the eu initiatives in iraq will be at risk . " a self-sufficient iraq would welcome more eu aid the us withdrawal could also lead to an increased effort by the eu if stability and security is maintained . " the europeans could step up and play a stronger role by expanding on their specific strengths once the americans are gone , " bauer said .
" this could help iraq 's full transition and also help the stability of the region as the eu has good diplomatic ties with many of the arab states and to a certain degree , iran .

the talks , hosted by the european commission , are taking place less than a week before kiev will be expected to hand over three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to russia for gas that it has started to store for the coming winter .
a dispute over payment earlier this year led to russia shutting off gas supplies to ukraine , which affected not only citizens there , but also those living in parts of the european union which depend on gas coming from pipelines running through ukraine .
a quarter of all the natural gas burned within the eu comes from russia , with 80 percent of that flowing through ukraine , mostly to the south-eastern corner of the continent .
transparency an issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is betting on a pipeline across the baltic sea to save itself from these disputes in the future weighed down by the global financial crisis , kiev claims it wo n't be able to come up with the money in time to buy the roughly 20 billion cubic meters of natural gas that it wants , and that has incited the eu to call on the international community to give ukraine a short term loan .
however , many organizations , including the imf , are n't convinced that naftogaz is in a position to receive funding .
ceyla pazarbasioglu , head of the imf delegation , told the reuters news agency that they were demanding that the state-owned gas giant undergo some serious reorganization , adding that the company needed to become more transparent and clean up its finances .
the multibillion euro loan would be part of the imf 's $ 16.4 billion program to help out nations hit hard by the economic crisis. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel has promised tax cuts to secure her party 's re-election , but rivals from left to right are attacking her program as unrealistic . germany 's conservatives have kicked off their election campaign with an explicit appeal to the middle-class .
" we want to relieve the burden on the middle of society , " said christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- general secretary , ronald pofalla , at the opening of the party conference in berlin on monday .
pofalla attacked his party 's main rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , accusing them of pursuing a strategy of " division and envy . "
" we want to reduce taxes , the spd wants to raise them .
we will make this abundantly clear over the next three months , " he said .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu agreed at the weekend that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign .
the main policy would be a modest cut in the lowest income tax bracket from 14 to 12 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier guenther oettinger has called for a rise in sales tax dissent in the ranks but there have been opposing voices among the conservatives .
two cdu state premiers have openly advocated an increase in certain taxes , such as value added tax , to offset the blowout in public expenditures caused by the global economic downturn .
so it was with an eye to the dissenters that chancellor merkel called for party unity when she took to the stage at the party conference , to the drawn-out applause of over 750 party deputies .
" sometimes a bit of lateral thinking is needed , " she said , in a veiled reference to her party 's internal tax-debate , " but we 've thought for long enough . "
merkel vowed , if re-elected , not to raise value added tax during the next term of office , but did n't elaborate on how her tax-cuts would be financed or when they would be introduced .
she also advocated her party 's goal of winning enough votes to ditch the spd as coalition partner in favour of the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we have the power to make our country stronger than it was before .
we have the power to promote growth ... and we say , we can best do this with a different coalition partner , " she said .
criticism from left and right the social democrats ' secretary-general , hubertus heil , said the cdu 's agenda " was not credible . "
he warned that " merkel is either trying to pull the wool over the voter 's eyes , or there really is no sound concept behind the whole thing . "
heil said that the cdu 's election program did not contain ideas on how to shape the country 's future .
with the country 's budget set for a record deficit , any promise to lower taxes was simply " unrealistic . "
criticism also came from the fdp - normally a strong advocate for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy , set to shrink by six percent , will be a key campaign theme the party 's juergen koppelin criticized the plans as " very vague and non-binding " , calling them " spineless " for not including a timetable to introduce the tax cuts .
but fdp leader , guido westerwelle , welcomed the conservatives ' overtures to form a coalition , calling their program a " good basis " for working together .
in contrast , the greens ' claudia roth , also with an eye on possible coalition talks , said the conservatives ' platform was looking " very distant from us . "
the latest opinion poll puts the conservatives on 35 percent of the vote .
right now , that would be just enough to win government with the fdp , who are polling 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left spd , the minority party in merkel 's government , still hopes to retain power in a second grand coalition .
but its goal of forming government with the greens seems increasingly unlikely .
the two parties are currently polling 24 and 15 percent respectively. nw / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.06.2009 merkel makes tax cuts into her pitch for re-election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is personally popular , but her party still only polls 35 percent in 90 days germans elect a new government .
chancellor angela merkel has promised tax cuts to secure her party 's re-election , but rivals from left to right are attacking her program as unrealistic . germany 's conservatives have kicked off their election campaign with an explicit appeal to the middle-class .
" we want to relieve the burden on the middle of society , " said christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- general secretary , ronald pofalla , at the opening of the party conference in berlin on monday .
pofalla attacked his party 's main rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , accusing them of pursuing a strategy of " division and envy . "
" we want to reduce taxes , the spd wants to raise them .
we will make this abundantly clear over the next three months , " he said .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu agreed at the weekend that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign .
the main policy would be a modest cut in the lowest income tax bracket from 14 to 12 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier guenther oettinger has called for a rise in sales tax dissent in the ranks but there have been opposing voices among the conservatives .
two cdu state premiers have openly advocated an increase in certain taxes , such as value added tax , to offset the blowout in public expenditures caused by the global economic downturn .
so it was with an eye to the dissenters that chancellor merkel called for party unity when she took to the stage at the party conference , to the drawn-out applause of over 750 party deputies .
" sometimes a bit of lateral thinking is needed , " she said , in a veiled reference to her party 's internal tax-debate , " but we 've thought for long enough . "
merkel vowed , if re-elected , not to raise value added tax during the next term of office , but did n't elaborate on how her tax-cuts would be financed or when they would be introduced .
she also advocated her party 's goal of winning enough votes to ditch the spd as coalition partner in favour of the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we have the power to make our country stronger than it was before .
we have the power to promote growth ... and we say , we can best do this with a different coalition partner , " she said .
criticism from left and right the social democrats ' secretary-general , hubertus heil , said the cdu 's agenda " was not credible . "
he warned that " merkel is either trying to pull the wool over the voter 's eyes , or there really is no sound concept behind the whole thing . "

but some military and political concerns remain . the date june 30 , 2009 may just be another in the continuing struggle for normalcy in iraq but it could prove to be one of the most significant of the country 's recent , blighted history .
on that day , us troops pull back from iraqi cities , leaving iraqi forces to take over control for security operations in urban areas .
the americans believe iraq is ready for such a responsibility but unsurprisingly there are concerns . " from a military and security standpoint it 's time for us to move out of the cities , " general ray odierno , the general in charge of us-led coalition forces told cnn on sunday .
" as for the iraqis , i do believe they are ready , " odierno added .
" they 've been working towards this for a long time .
security remains good ; we 've seen constant improvement in the security forces , constant improvement in governance .
i believe this is the time for them to take ultimate responsibility . " us troops have been pulling out of iraq 's cities before tuesday 's deadline as part of a staged withdrawal over the last eight months and " overall stability in iraq remains good , " general odierno said . iraqi parliamentarians show confidence in home army this feeling of optimism is shared by many iraqi parliamentarians .
liberal shiite representative ayad jamaleldin told deutsche welle that despite the continuing fragility of the war-torn country , he was confident that the iraqi armed forces would be able to protect the country 's citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi security forces have the trust of many politicians " of course , the iraqi armed forces are in a position to guarantee the security of the cities , " he said .
" they are even more effective than the multinational troops , because they can identify the different factions faster and better .
in addition , they are more knowledgeable and better suited to deal with geographical factors . " sunni representative shadha al abussi agreed .
" we have much confidence in our own troops , " he told dw .
" i believe , if each citizen could contribute to the control of the situation in iraq , we could record even greater successes . " iraqi security services say they will meet the us withdrawal with their biggest deployment of troops and policemen in the six years since the us-led invasion of the country .
some 120,000 additional soldiers and police will be deployed to baghdad alone , and thousands of others will be deployed to other cities . despite a spasm of violence including bombings that have killed more than 100 people this month alone , us president barack obama and his military are committed to their end-june withdrawal of american troops from iraq 's urban areas as part of a move from a war-like to a diplomatic footing with baghdad . the retreat is in line with last november 's status of forces agreement -lrb- sofa -rrb- , which set out a timetable for a complete us troop withdrawal from iraq by 2011 . us troops to remain " on call " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us forces will operate between cities and on borders nonetheless , analysts said the withdrawal of us combat forces from iraqi cities will be less dramatic than it seems because the military , while less visible , can still intervene if iraqi security forces appeal for help . us forces will " still be conducting significant operations outside of the cities , in the belts of the major cities , and i still believe this will enable us to maintain the current security and stability situation here in iraq , " odierno said . us soldiers will continue to patrol the most conflict-ridden districts of the country outside the cities at the invitation of the iraqi government and patrol borders .
a few will remain in iraqi cities in an advisory capacity . fears over renewed instability in potential power vacuum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear attacks will increase when the us pulls out despite continued us military support , at least for now , the recent bomb attacks and on-going unrest between arab nationalists and kurds in the northern city of mosul have raised concerns about an increase in violence in line with a reduction in us and allied involvement . general odierno blamed the recent attacks on " fractured extremist elements " and suggested that the bombings and unrest were designed to sow the seeds of doubt ahead of the us withdrawal . " they 're trying to use this time frame and this -lrb- pullout -rrb- date to first gain attention for themselves and also to divert attention from the success of the iraqi security forces , " he said , adding that the recent spike in attacks was not a sign of a broader increase of violence across the country . eu involvement in iraq at the mercy of us plans the iraqis and those concerned citizens in regional neighboring countries are not the only ones whose future could be cast into doubt by the partial us pull-out and then its final withdrawal . michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , believes the europeans involved in iraq have much to lose if the us withdrawal leads to an increase in violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's pm nuri al-maliki benefits from eu support " individually , european countries like germany and france have been unwilling to engage in iraq but the eu plays a large , important role in non-direct engagement , " he told deutsche welle .
" the eu is the main financial contributor to un and world bank projects there , it is involved in an energy dialogue and has recently upgraded its technical and co-operation agreement with iraq into a partnership . " the eu knows it can play a strong role in advancing administrative and electoral reforms , " bauer added .
" these are its specific strengths and the eu can help the government through this . " however , bauer said , if the us withdrawal leads to anarchy and civil war , the europeans will be in no position to address the violence . " these latest attacks are attempts by insurgents to stir up new sectarian violence and destabilize the country , " bauer said .
" this was in some ways expected but what is in question is whether the iraqis can govern through this and whether their army can provide protection when the americans go .
if not , all the eu initiatives in iraq will be at risk . " a self-sufficient iraq would welcome more eu aid the us withdrawal could also lead to an increased effort by the eu if stability and security is maintained . " the europeans could step up and play a stronger role by expanding on their specific strengths once the americans are gone , " bauer said .
" this could help iraq 's full transition and also help the stability of the region as the eu has good diplomatic ties with many of the arab states and to a certain degree , iran .
if iraq can govern and protect itself , the eu could become a strong political and diplomatic partner . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some military and political concerns remain . the date june 30 , 2009 may just be another in the continuing struggle for normalcy in iraq but it could prove to be one of the most significant of the country 's recent , blighted history .
on that day , us troops pull back from iraqi cities , leaving iraqi forces to take over control for security operations in urban areas .
the americans believe iraq is ready for such a responsibility but unsurprisingly there are concerns . " from a military and security standpoint it 's time for us to move out of the cities , " general ray odierno , the general in charge of us-led coalition forces told cnn on sunday .
" as for the iraqis , i do believe they are ready , " odierno added .
" they 've been working towards this for a long time .
security remains good ; we 've seen constant improvement in the security forces , constant improvement in governance .
i believe this is the time for them to take ultimate responsibility . " us troops have been pulling out of iraq 's cities before tuesday 's deadline as part of a staged withdrawal over the last eight months and " overall stability in iraq remains good , " general odierno said . iraqi parliamentarians show confidence in home army this feeling of optimism is shared by many iraqi parliamentarians .
liberal shiite representative ayad jamaleldin told deutsche welle that despite the continuing fragility of the war-torn country , he was confident that the iraqi armed forces would be able to protect the country 's citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi security forces have the trust of many politicians " of course , the iraqi armed forces are in a position to guarantee the security of the cities , " he said .
" they are even more effective than the multinational troops , because they can identify the different factions faster and better .
in addition , they are more knowledgeable and better suited to deal with geographical factors . " sunni representative shadha al abussi agreed .
" we have much confidence in our own troops , " he told dw .
" i believe , if each citizen could contribute to the control of the situation in iraq , we could record even greater successes . " iraqi security services say they will meet the us withdrawal with their biggest deployment of troops and policemen in the six years since the us-led invasion of the country .
some 120,000 additional soldiers and police will be deployed to baghdad alone , and thousands of others will be deployed to other cities . despite a spasm of violence including bombings that have killed more than 100 people this month alone , us president barack obama and his military are committed to their end-june withdrawal of american troops from iraq 's urban areas as part of a move from a war-like to a diplomatic footing with baghdad . the retreat is in line with last november 's status of forces agreement -lrb- sofa -rrb- , which set out a timetable for a complete us troop withdrawal from iraq by 2011 . us troops to remain " on call " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us forces will operate between cities and on borders nonetheless , analysts said the withdrawal of us combat forces from iraqi cities will be less dramatic than it seems because the military , while less visible , can still intervene if iraqi security forces appeal for help . us forces will " still be conducting significant operations outside of the cities , in the belts of the major cities , and i still believe this will enable us to maintain the current security and stability situation here in iraq , " odierno said . us soldiers will continue to patrol the most conflict-ridden districts of the country outside the cities at the invitation of the iraqi government and patrol borders .
a few will remain in iraqi cities in an advisory capacity . fears over renewed instability in potential power vacuum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear attacks will increase when the us pulls out despite continued us military support , at least for now , the recent bomb attacks and on-going unrest between arab nationalists and kurds in the northern city of mosul have raised concerns about an increase in violence in line with a reduction in us and allied involvement . general odierno blamed the recent attacks on " fractured extremist elements " and suggested that the bombings and unrest were designed to sow the seeds of doubt ahead of the us withdrawal . " they 're trying to use this time frame and this -lrb- pullout -rrb- date to first gain attention for themselves and also to divert attention from the success of the iraqi security forces , " he said , adding that the recent spike in attacks was not a sign of a broader increase of violence across the country . eu involvement in iraq at the mercy of us plans the iraqis and those concerned citizens in regional neighboring countries are not the only ones whose future could be cast into doubt by the partial us pull-out and then its final withdrawal . michael bauer , a middle east expert at the center for applied policy research in munich , believes the europeans involved in iraq have much to lose if the us withdrawal leads to an increase in violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's pm nuri al-maliki benefits from eu support " individually , european countries like germany and france have been unwilling to engage in iraq but the eu plays a large , important role in non-direct engagement , " he told deutsche welle .
" the eu is the main financial contributor to un and world bank projects there , it is involved in an energy dialogue and has recently upgraded its technical and co-operation agreement with iraq into a partnership . " the eu knows it can play a strong role in advancing administrative and electoral reforms , " bauer added .
" these are its specific strengths and the eu can help the government through this . " however , bauer said , if the us withdrawal leads to anarchy and civil war , the europeans will be in no position to address the violence . " these latest attacks are attempts by insurgents to stir up new sectarian violence and destabilize the country , " bauer said .
" this was in some ways expected but what is in question is whether the iraqis can govern through this and whether their army can provide protection when the americans go .
if not , all the eu initiatives in iraq will be at risk . " a self-sufficient iraq would welcome more eu aid the us withdrawal could also lead to an increased effort by the eu if stability and security is maintained . " the europeans could step up and play a stronger role by expanding on their specific strengths once the americans are gone , " bauer said .
" this could help iraq 's full transition and also help the stability of the region as the eu has good diplomatic ties with many of the arab states and to a certain degree , iran .
if iraq can govern and protect itself , the eu could become a strong political and diplomatic partner . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel has promised tax cuts to secure her party 's re-election , but rivals from left to right are attacking her program as unrealistic . germany 's conservatives have kicked off their election campaign with an explicit appeal to the middle-class .
" we want to relieve the burden on the middle of society , " said christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- general secretary , ronald pofalla , at the opening of the party conference in berlin on monday .
pofalla attacked his party 's main rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , accusing them of pursuing a strategy of " division and envy . "
" we want to reduce taxes , the spd wants to raise them .
we will make this abundantly clear over the next three months , " he said .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu agreed at the weekend that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign .
the main policy would be a modest cut in the lowest income tax bracket from 14 to 12 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier guenther oettinger has called for a rise in sales tax dissent in the ranks but there have been opposing voices among the conservatives .
two cdu state premiers have openly advocated an increase in certain taxes , such as value added tax , to offset the blowout in public expenditures caused by the global economic downturn .
so it was with an eye to the dissenters that chancellor merkel called for party unity when she took to the stage at the party conference , to the drawn-out applause of over 750 party deputies .
" sometimes a bit of lateral thinking is needed , " she said , in a veiled reference to her party 's internal tax-debate , " but we 've thought for long enough . "
merkel vowed , if re-elected , not to raise value added tax during the next term of office , but did n't elaborate on how her tax-cuts would be financed or when they would be introduced .
she also advocated her party 's goal of winning enough votes to ditch the spd as coalition partner in favour of the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we have the power to make our country stronger than it was before .
we have the power to promote growth ... and we say , we can best do this with a different coalition partner , " she said .
criticism from left and right the social democrats ' secretary-general , hubertus heil , said the cdu 's agenda " was not credible . "
he warned that " merkel is either trying to pull the wool over the voter 's eyes , or there really is no sound concept behind the whole thing . "
heil said that the cdu 's election program did not contain ideas on how to shape the country 's future .
with the country 's budget set for a record deficit , any promise to lower taxes was simply " unrealistic . "
criticism also came from the fdp - normally a strong advocate for tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy , set to shrink by six percent , will be a key campaign theme the party 's juergen koppelin criticized the plans as " very vague and non-binding " , calling them " spineless " for not including a timetable to introduce the tax cuts .
but fdp leader , guido westerwelle , welcomed the conservatives ' overtures to form a coalition , calling their program a " good basis " for working together .
in contrast , the greens ' claudia roth , also with an eye on possible coalition talks , said the conservatives ' platform was looking " very distant from us . "
the latest opinion poll puts the conservatives on 35 percent of the vote .
right now , that would be just enough to win government with the fdp , who are polling 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left spd , the minority party in merkel 's government , still hopes to retain power in a second grand coalition .
but its goal of forming government with the greens seems increasingly unlikely .
the two parties are currently polling 24 and 15 percent respectively. nw / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german company is on the brink of collapse and has said it urgently needs government aid to stay in business . for quelle , there are still hopes that disaster can be avoided .
the head of the company , konrad hilbers , on monday morning urged the government in berlin to decide in favor of the mail-order house and to grant a government loan that would bail the company at least out of its most urgent troubles . " there still is a way to avoid bankruptcy , " he said .
" we need to those discussions and urgently should get some positive results from berlin . " last wednesday , a committee of federal and state finance ministers considered extending quelle up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- worth of loans . the decision on whether or not the loan will be granted is expected to come monday evening after yet another meeting of the inter-ministerial committee . so far , chancellor angela merkel had been rather reluctant to rush to the rescue of quelle , defended her government 's reticence by pointing to the european union 's competition rules . " we have to let the eu in on the whole process , " she said , adding that nobody would benefit if the eu ruled against any state-loans after they had already been made . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer is concerned about the impact of job cuts in his state but the bavarian csu – sister party to merkel ’ s conservative cdu – over the weekend stepped up the pressure on berlin to rule in favor of quelle .
state premier horst seehofer , raised the stakes on sunday , june 28 , accusing his fellow conservatives in the federal government of putting thousands of jobs at risk . " jobs are at acute risk , nobody can want this , " seehofer said . what should be done ? the conservative politician demanded that berlin agree to contribute to a package of loans to save quelle , after it emerged on saturday that the company was unable to pay its suppliers and was teetering on the edge of collapse . bavaria , where most of quelle 's 8,000 employees are located , led the charge , pledging 21 million euros in aid .
the state of saxony offeredan additional 4 million euros . but the federal government later said that it wanted quelle to improve its application for assistance and that it would wait until the eu 's competition watchdog in brussels had reviewed the situation before contributing funds . death of a sales concept quelle is a highly symbolic german company , especially among the older generation , and has a mail-order catalogue featuring everything from washing machines to underwear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quelle 's winter catalogue was delivered with borrowed funds last week together with the department store chain karstadt , it is one of the most prominent casualties of the bankruptcy of its parent company arcandor . yet not everyone wants to see it bailed out . henning koopmann , the boss of quelle 's competitor neckermann , said any state rescue for his rival would be " unfair . " " a state-backed loan might save 8,000 jobs at quelle for now , but it would also endanger the 72,000 jobs at other mail-order companies in germany , " he said . bavaria 's opposition social democrats also criticized the regional government , accusing it of conducting a cynical drama on the backs of quelle employees . on saturday , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that quelle transferred all of its cash to its parent arcandor , only hours before that company declared insolvency on june 9 . an arcandor spokesperson later confirmed the report , but said the transfers were automated and not motivated by the insolvency . since then , quelle has been surviving off the kindness of its suppliers , who have suspended their invoices . nw / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the talks , hosted by the european commission , are taking place less than a week before kiev will be expected to hand over three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- to russia for gas that it has started to store for the coming winter .
a dispute over payment earlier this year led to russia shutting off gas supplies to ukraine , which affected not only citizens there , but also those living in parts of the european union which depend on gas coming from pipelines running through ukraine .
a quarter of all the natural gas burned within the eu comes from russia , with 80 percent of that flowing through ukraine , mostly to the south-eastern corner of the continent .
transparency an issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is betting on a pipeline across the baltic sea to save itself from these disputes in the future weighed down by the global financial crisis , kiev claims it wo n't be able to come up with the money in time to buy the roughly 20 billion cubic meters of natural gas that it wants , and that has incited the eu to call on the international community to give ukraine a short term loan .
however , many organizations , including the imf , are n't convinced that naftogaz is in a position to receive funding .
ceyla pazarbasioglu , head of the imf delegation , told the reuters news agency that they were demanding that the state-owned gas giant undergo some serious reorganization , adding that the company needed to become more transparent and clean up its finances .
the multibillion euro loan would be part of the imf 's $ 16.4 billion program to help out nations hit hard by the economic crisis. mrm / dpa / reuters / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the vatican wants to open the sarcophagus and conduct further tests . the marble coffin in rome 's st. paul 's basilica has never been opened , but , according to tests conducted thus far , the tomb contains pieces of human bone that have been dated to the time of saint paul . pope benedict shared the findings sunday at a service outside the church marking the end of the vatican 's pauline year in honor of the apostle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tomb in st. paul 's basilica has been sealed for some five centuries carbon dating showed that the bone fragments belonged to someone who lived between the first and the second century ad , the pontiff said . " this seems to confirm the unanimous and uncontested tradition that they are the mortal remains of the apostle paul , " added benedict . paul - born saul - had actively persecuted christians , but converted after seeing jesus in a vision while on the road to damascus . he is believed to have been beheaded in the year 67 in rome after years of travel as an early missionary to spread the message of jesus . archeologists collected the bone fragments by inserting a probe through a small hole in the tomb , which is located under the basilica 's main altar . bits of incense , purple linen with gold sequins and blue linen were also found , said the pope . though the findings had been known for more than a year , the vatican waited for benedict to make the official announcement .
he is likely to approve further tests and the opening of the tomb . kjb / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if one wanted to summarise this result , one could say : the constitution says ' yes ' to the lisbon treaty but demands that parliament 's right to participation be strengthened at the national level , " the federal constitutional court said . " the court is confident that the last barrier for adopting the ratification document will be cleared . " the decision by the constitutional court in karlsruhe removes one of several remaining hurdles for the treaty , which aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all members of the bloc must ratify the document for it to take effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel has championed the treaty the german parliament has already approved the treaty , but the necessary signature from president horst koehler is missing .
he said he wo n't sign until the outcome of the court proceedings is known . there are still three other countries holding up the process : ireland , poland and the czech republic . ireland is set to hold another referendum on the text later this year , after its devastating no vote last year .
polls now indicate a swing in favor of the treaty . the polish parliament has approved the treaty , but president lech kaczynski says he wo n't sign until after the irish vote .
czech president vaclav klaus says he will wait until the last minute to add his signature . undermining sovereignty german opponents of the lisbon treaty had argued that the document undercuts german sovereignty .
they say that the country 's constitution would be subject to european law and say the constitutional court – which is deciding on the treaty on tuesday – would lose its authority . plaintiffs include members of the far-left political party die linke and conservative federal mp peter gauweiler from the csu party .
gauweiler said he feared the treaty would undermine the german parliament 's authority . " the only option left for the german parliament then would be to implement the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- decision , " he says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the treaty does not contradict the german constitution more democratic supporters of the lisbon treaty dismiss such fears , and insist that germany and europe would become more democratic and more transparent . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , from the csu 's sister conservative cdu party , says the treaty would protect the german constitution , not undermine it .
schaeuble says the constitution 's preamble , dating from 1949 , states that germany wants to be an equal member of a unified europe which works towards world peace .

it is the first big tribute to jackson , who collapsed and died last week in the city at the age of 50 .
his family insisted a second autopsy be carried out on his body because of what they said were " unanswered questions " over how he died .
speaking on the red carpet , joe jackson said he had " a lot of concerns " over events surrounding his son 's death .

unconfirmed reports suggest the singer had been taking a daily dose of demerol , a painkiller also widely known as pethidine .
on saturday police carried out what they said was an extensive interview with jackson 's personal doctor , conrad murray , who was with the singer when he died .
a spokeswoman for dr murray said he was not a suspect in the case .
he had " helped identify the circumstances around the death of the pop icon and clarified some inconsistencies " , she said .

thousands of passengers were delayed , with some saying they had to queue for hours .
others had to rebook or board flights without their luggage .
airport operator baa blamed a mechanical failure which was resolved .
but one passenger told the bbc that as many as 60 travellers were forced to spend the night at the airport .
british airways apologised for the inconvenience and said it was doing everything it could to minimise disruption .
the airline said no flights had been cancelled as a result of the problem and had hoped its customers could fly on sunday night .
but rob mortimer , who missed his flight to new york because of check-in delays , said he and dozens of others were forced to sleep in the airport without any help with bedding or hot drinks from baa .
" there were probably about 50 or 60 people that i could see just bedded down on the cold , hard floor , " he said .
" every time i went to ask they said the hotel rooms had already been given out to the most deserving cases .
they said we could sort out our own hotel , but they were all fully booked anyway because of what happened at terminal 5 . "
mr mortimer was due to fly out of heathrow on monday morning .
" i know it 's baa 's fault really , but i 've travelled so much with ba and i must say i am disappointed , " he said .
mr mortimer had been due to start a new job in new york , and was relieved that his new employers accepted he would not be there on time .
expense baa said it was confident that all disrupted passengers would be able to fly out of terminal 5 on monday .
but some of those affected faced considerable expense to change their plans , including nial o 'connor , from london , who was due to fly from t5 to marseille on sunday .
however , after his luggage went missing , he rebooked his flight with ba and was given one flying out of gatwick on monday .
he said the change of plan has cost him an extra £ 80 to rebook the flight , £ 130 on a taxi and more on a hotel .
mr o 'connor was told his luggage would be flown out to marseille separately .
he told the bbc he was very angry and had found ba unhelpful .
barry goldstone , who was due to fly to denver with ba on sunday afternoon , described the scene at the terminal as " absolute chaos " .
" they -lsb- ba -rsb- do n't seem to have any continuity plan if anything goes wrong , and unfortunately they do n't seem to have any consistency of information either . "
one baggage handler said at one stage there had been more than 1,000 pieces of luggage piled up , and described the situation as " absolute chaos " .
' sorry ' a baa spokeswoman said on sunday night : " we are working hard with our colleagues at british airways to help passengers to continue their journeys .
" we hope that passengers wishing to depart tonight will be able to do so and we are sorry for the obvious inconvenience to travellers and british airways . "
a ba spokesman said : " as a result of the problem some passengers have been unable to check in bags .
check-in has now reopened but there will be some delays .
" we apologise to our customers for the inconvenience .
we are doing everything we can to minimise disruption . "

but rob mortimer , who missed his flight to new york because of check-in delays , said he and dozens of others were forced to sleep in the airport without any help with bedding or hot drinks from baa .
" there were probably about 50 or 60 people that i could see just bedded down on the cold , hard floor , " he said .
" every time i went to ask they said the hotel rooms had already been given out to the most deserving cases .
they said we could sort out our own hotel , but they were all fully booked anyway because of what happened at terminal 5 . "
mr mortimer was due to fly out of heathrow on monday morning .
" i know it 's baa 's fault really , but i 've travelled so much with ba and i must say i am disappointed , " he said .
mr mortimer had been due to start a new job in new york , and was relieved that his new employers accepted he would not be there on time .
expense baa said it was confident that all disrupted passengers would be able to fly out of terminal 5 on monday .
some queued for hours before being told they were in the " wrong " queue but some of those affected faced considerable expense to change their plans , including nial o 'connor , from london , who was due to fly from t5 to marseille on sunday .
however , after his luggage went missing , he rebooked his flight with ba and was given one flying out of gatwick on monday .
he said the change of plan has cost him an extra £ 80 to rebook the flight , £ 130 on a taxi and more on a hotel .
mr o 'connor was told his luggage would be flown out to marseille separately .
he told the bbc he was very angry and had found ba unhelpful .
barry goldstone , who was due to fly to denver with ba on sunday afternoon , described the scene at the terminal as " absolute chaos " .
" they -lsb- ba -rsb- do n't seem to have any continuity plan if anything goes wrong , and unfortunately they do n't seem to have any consistency of information either . "
one baggage handler said at one stage there had been more than 1,000 pieces of luggage piled up , and described the situation as " absolute chaos " .
' sorry ' a baa spokeswoman said on sunday night : " we are working hard with our colleagues at british airways to help passengers to continue their journeys .
" we hope that passengers wishing to depart tonight will be able to do so and we are sorry for the obvious inconvenience to travellers and british airways . "
a ba spokesman said : " as a result of the problem some passengers have been unable to check in bags .
check-in has now reopened but there will be some delays .
" we apologise to our customers for the inconvenience .
we are doing everything we can to minimise disruption . "
the terminal was hit by problems when it opened in march 2008 , with flights cancelled and thousands of bags lost .

thousands of passengers were delayed , with some saying they had to queue for hours .
others had to rebook or board flights without their luggage .
airport operator baa blamed a mechanical failure which was resolved .
but one passenger told the bbc that as many as 60 travellers were forced to spend the night at the airport .
british airways apologised for the inconvenience and said it was doing everything it could to minimise disruption .
the airline said no flights had been cancelled as a result of the problem and had hoped its customers could fly on sunday night .
but rob mortimer , who missed his flight to new york because of check-in delays , said he and dozens of others were forced to sleep in the airport without any help with bedding or hot drinks from baa .
" there were probably about 50 or 60 people that i could see just bedded down on the cold , hard floor , " he said .
" every time i went to ask they said the hotel rooms had already been given out to the most deserving cases .
they said we could sort out our own hotel , but they were all fully booked anyway because of what happened at terminal 5 . "
mr mortimer was due to fly out of heathrow on monday morning .
" i know it 's baa 's fault really , but i 've travelled so much with ba and i must say i am disappointed , " he said .
mr mortimer had been due to start a new job in new york , and was relieved that his new employers accepted he would not be there on time .
expense baa said it was confident that all disrupted passengers would be able to fly out of terminal 5 on monday .
some queued for hours before being told they were in the " wrong " queue but some of those affected faced considerable expense to change their plans , including nial o 'connor , from london , who was due to fly from t5 to marseille on sunday .
however , after his luggage went missing , he rebooked his flight with ba and was given one flying out of gatwick on monday .
he said the change of plan has cost him an extra £ 80 to rebook the flight , £ 130 on a taxi and more on a hotel .
mr o 'connor was told his luggage would be flown out to marseille separately .
he told the bbc he was very angry and had found ba unhelpful .
barry goldstone , who was due to fly to denver with ba on sunday afternoon , described the scene at the terminal as " absolute chaos " .
" they -lsb- ba -rsb- do n't seem to have any continuity plan if anything goes wrong , and unfortunately they do n't seem to have any consistency of information either . "
one baggage handler said at one stage there had been more than 1,000 pieces of luggage piled up , and described the situation as " absolute chaos " .
' sorry ' a baa spokeswoman said on sunday night : " we are working hard with our colleagues at british airways to help passengers to continue their journeys .
" we hope that passengers wishing to depart tonight will be able to do so and we are sorry for the obvious inconvenience to travellers and british airways . "
a ba spokesman said : " as a result of the problem some passengers have been unable to check in bags .
check-in has now reopened but there will be some delays .
" we apologise to our customers for the inconvenience .
we are doing everything we can to minimise disruption . "
the terminal was hit by problems when it opened in march 2008 , with flights cancelled and thousands of bags lost .

preston has long been a significant market centre , however , its early history is mostly unrecorded .
the original settlement was clearly not of roman foundation , but appears to have developed from an anglian settlement sometime around the 7th century .
land was given to st wilfrid in the 7th century to establish a church that took his name until 1581 .
it is clear that preston was , for most of its history , a small town but relative to other market centres in the county it was always of significant economic importance , being considered the richest borough in the 14th century .
it was never walled , had only one church until the 17th century and almost into the 19th century comprised of only three main streets ; church street , fishergate and friargate .
their medieval burgage plots are still visible today .
these were surrounded by scores of fields owned by the freemen of the town whose names were recorded every 20 years at the famous preston guild .
admired by writers such as daniel defoe , preston developed into the fashionable resort of the county 's ' polite society ' .
headed by the stanleys , whose political and financial influence remained important for decades , preston became well known for its grand houses , elegant streets , coaching inns and avenham walk , the 17th century promenade with its views of the river ribble .
despite its small size , preston was the stage for battles of national importance - in 1648 cromwell 's brilliant victory over the duke of hamilton and in 1715 , the defeat of the jacobites .
in 1732 it was the birthplace of an individual who had a significant role in creation of the modern world - richard arkwright .
suddenly preston changed .
industrial development resulting from better toll roads and bridges , the lancaster canal , numerous railways , gas lighting , of which preston was a pioneer and the water and steam powered technology of cotton manufacturers such as the horrocks family , transformed preston into the model of the 19th century industrial society .
the gentry quickly abandoned their great houses while a new class of wealthy professionals and entrepreneurs developed areas such as winckley square , and then created the suburbs in the 1850s .
the problems of poverty , pollution , unrest and social polarization were central to preston 's history at this time .
thousands poured into preston , filling the old quarters with overcrowded yards and alleys .
insufficient water supplies , lack of sewerage and child mortality remained significant problems for 100 years , although this period also saw educational and scientific advancements , public transport , sporting achievements and the rise of teetotalism .
charles dickens and karl marx were among many who visited preston to witness a new society forming as the town fields quickly disappeared beneath factories , terraces of workers cottages , churches and public parks .
this new society left preston an architectural heritage of elegance -lrb- the harris museum and library in 1891 -rrb- , economic power -lrb- centenary mill in 1895 -rrb- , religious confidence -lrb- st walburgs in 1854 -rrb- and civic pride despite the loss of important buildings in the 20th century including sir george gilbert scott 's gothic town hall -lrb- 1867 -rrb- .
the 20th century was a period of economic and social diversification as preston responded to regional , national and global changes .
from the end of the 19th century preston became the seat of the new county council -lrb- 1882 -rrb- .
the huge albert edward dock which opened in 1892 , answered the challenge of the movement of cotton manufacturing to other parts of the world .
new industries developed .
dick kerr still exists as part of british aerospace ; cortaulds ' factory at walton , once the world 's largest producer of rayon , does not .
in the second half of the 20th century the preston by-pass , the nation 's first motorway and the preston ring road addressed the growing problems of traffic congestion at this ancient crossroads .

the de hoghtons are descended directly from harvey de walter , one of the companions of william the conqueror , and through the female line from the lady godiva of coventry , wife of leofric , earl of mercia .
since its re-creation in 1565 by thomas hoghton this ancient , fortified , hilltop manor house has retained its tudor-elizabethan character and construction in its entirety and is the only true baronial residence in lancashire .
it is situated mid-way between preston and blackburn on a hill 650 feet above sea level with magnificent views of lancashire , the lake district and north wales .
the approach is along a perfect straight ¾ mile long drive .
to the north-east the hill is precipitous and around the foot the river darwen plunges through a deep ravine .
in the wooded land and pasture surrounding the hill above the river darwen , 113 species of birds have been observed .
red deer and white bulls used to roam in great numbers and the white bull survives in the family crest and on the weather vane atop the gate house tower .
the grand entrance to the inner courtyard the open piece of land in front of the house is known as the tilting green , a space used in medieval times for jousting .
to the rear of the house are the wilderness lawn and tudor garden with clipped yews leading to the ramparts .
the house as it now stands gives an excellent idea of the structure - a stone house with battlements , english in every window , mullion and moulding .
the buildings around the first of two courtyards housed the servants and the second , the residential quarters and banqueting hall .
it was above the archway to the inner courtyard that the great keep stood but having been blown up in the english civil war -lrb- 1642 -rrb- was never rebuilt .
the bell hanging in the south-east corner was given to the family by thomas hoghton 's friend dr william allen of rossall -lrb- later cardinal -rrb- following the suppression of whalley abbey .
thomas hoghton was a catholic but the faith was out of fashion in the then queen elizabeth 's day .
in order to practice their religion jesuit priests travelled from house to house avoiding detection from the authorities by hiding in concealed recesses several of which have been discovered in the house .
thomas went into exile in france and remained there until his death in 1580 when alexander inherited the title .
one of the first visitors was a young playwright named william shakespeare .
he stayed with the family as a member of a troup of theatrical players and whilst there he was a tutor to the children .
in 1617 sir richard hoghton , a baronet of the first creation , invited king james i to stay at the tower .
among the guests were the duke of buckingham and several earls , knights , lords and ladies .
the entire length of the driveway was carpeted in rich red velvet for the occasion .
they were greeted by sir richard 's eldest son sir gilbert whom the king had knighted at the unusually early age of 15 years .
james i rode through the hall on his horse !
james i was particular about where he slept as several attempts had been made on his life .
it was not unknown for very small people to be smuggled into a royal bed-chamber , hidden beneath the bed and emerge in the middle of the night to murder the occupant .
james i did n't believe in taking chances so , before alighting from his horse , he rode up the staircase along the passageway until he came to the last room on the top floor with only one means of access to be guarded .
during the three day visit the king and his retinue went stag-hunting and dined lavishly .
a copy of the menu is on display in the banqueting hall .
it was in this room that history was made when during a banquet king james so enjoyed a loin of beef that he knighted it ' sir loin ' .
unfortunately , the unstinting hospitality bankrupted sir richard and he spent some years in fleet debtor 's prison .
the king 's bed chamber as it is now known contains the gown worn by lady philomena de hoghton at the 1953 coronation of queen elizabeth ii in westminster abbey .
in the 17th century king william iii was a frequent visitor to the tower being a personal friend of sir charles hoghton who founded preston grammar school .
lewis carroll author of ' alice in wonderland ' also had a family connection with the tower .
his great , great , grandmother lucy hoghton lived there is the 1700 's .
in 1854 charles dickens , the most popular novelist of the 19th century , climbed the hill to the tower , explored the building and featured it in a short story entitled ' george silverman 's explanation ' .
david tennant as casanova , filmed at the tower king george v and queen mary visited in 1913 .
this time the long drive was lined by tenants , school children and visitors .
the king later recorded in his diary that he had dined at the same table as his stuart ancestors nearly 300 years before .
this tudor table was crafted ' in situ ' from a single oak tree felled from the estate 's woods .
there is however a darker side to the tower .
so many ghostly experiences have been witnessed by the staff and visitors that an extensive record has been kept in a special ghost file .
beneath hoghton tower , reputedly the third most haunted house in britain , lies a warren of underground passages and dungeons , a reminder of the legend of the lancashire witches .
the building has many other interesting features including the tudor well house , 120 feet deep with horse-drawn pump and oaken winding gear .
the state bedroom contains the state bed carved in samlesbury -lrb- 1560-65 -rrb- .
the beautifully proportioned ball room with fine , decorative late victorian doors and panelling by gillows of lancaster .
the magnificent banqueting hall with windows containing 4,000 panes of flemish stained glass , original decorative ceiling and minstrels ' gallery .
leading off the minstrels ' gallery is the room containing an impressive collection of dolls ' houses .

bbc - lancashire - local landmarks : hoghton tower / history bbc local -pipe- lancashire -pipe- things to do -pipe- people & places -pipe- tv & radio -pipe- 08:24 gmt , monday , 29 june 2009 09:24 uk local landmarks : hoghton tower hoghton tower , a grade i listed building , is the ancestral home of the de hoghton family .
the de hoghtons are descended directly from harvey de walter , one of the companions of william the conqueror , and through the female line from the lady godiva of coventry , wife of leofric , earl of mercia .
since its re-creation in 1565 by thomas hoghton this ancient , fortified , hilltop manor house has retained its tudor-elizabethan character and construction in its entirety and is the only true baronial residence in lancashire .
it is situated mid-way between preston and blackburn on a hill 650 feet above sea level with magnificent views of lancashire , the lake district and north wales .
the approach is along a perfect straight ¾ mile long drive .
to the north-east the hill is precipitous and around the foot the river darwen plunges through a deep ravine .
in the wooded land and pasture surrounding the hill above the river darwen , 113 species of birds have been observed .
red deer and white bulls used to roam in great numbers and the white bull survives in the family crest and on the weather vane atop the gate house tower .
the open piece of land in front of the house is known as the tilting green , a space used in medieval times for jousting .
to the rear of the house are the wilderness lawn and tudor garden with clipped yews leading to the ramparts .
the house as it now stands gives an excellent idea of the structure - a stone house with battlements , english in every window , mullion and moulding .
the buildings around the first of two courtyards housed the servants and the second , the residential quarters and banqueting hall .
it was above the archway to the inner courtyard that the great keep stood but having been blown up in the english civil war -lrb- 1642 -rrb- was never rebuilt .
the bell hanging in the south-east corner was given to the family by thomas hoghton 's friend dr william allen of rossall -lrb- later cardinal -rrb- following the suppression of whalley abbey .
thomas hoghton was a catholic but the faith was out of fashion in the then queen elizabeth 's day .
in order to practice their religion jesuit priests travelled from house to house avoiding detection from the authorities by hiding in concealed recesses several of which have been discovered in the house .
thomas went into exile in france and remained there until his death in 1580 when alexander inherited the title .
one of the first visitors was a young playwright named william shakespeare .
he stayed with the family as a member of a troup of theatrical players and whilst there he was a tutor to the children .
in 1617 sir richard hoghton , a baronet of the first creation , invited king james i to stay at the tower .
among the guests were the duke of buckingham and several earls , knights , lords and ladies .
the entire length of the driveway was carpeted in rich red velvet for the occasion .
they were greeted by sir richard 's eldest son sir gilbert whom the king had knighted at the unusually early age of 15 years .
james i was particular about where he slept as several attempts had been made on his life .
it was not unknown for very small people to be smuggled into a royal bed-chamber , hidden beneath the bed and emerge in the middle of the night to murder the occupant .
james i did n't believe in taking chances so , before alighting from his horse , he rode up the staircase along the passageway until he came to the last room on the top floor with only one means of access to be guarded .
during the three day visit the king and his retinue went stag-hunting and dined lavishly .
a copy of the menu is on display in the banqueting hall .
it was in this room that history was made when during a banquet king james so enjoyed a loin of beef that he knighted it ' sir loin ' .
unfortunately , the unstinting hospitality bankrupted sir richard and he spent some years in fleet debtor 's prison .
the king 's bed chamber as it is now known contains the gown worn by lady philomena de hoghton at the 1953 coronation of queen elizabeth ii in westminster abbey .
in the 17th century king william iii was a frequent visitor to the tower being a personal friend of sir charles hoghton who founded preston grammar school .
lewis carroll author of ' alice in wonderland ' also had a family connection with the tower .
his great , great , grandmother lucy hoghton lived there is the 1700 's .
in 1854 charles dickens , the most popular novelist of the 19th century , climbed the hill to the tower , explored the building and featured it in a short story entitled ' george silverman 's explanation ' .
king george v and queen mary visited in 1913 .
this time the long drive was lined by tenants , school children and visitors .
the king later recorded in his diary that he had dined at the same table as his stuart ancestors nearly 300 years before .
this tudor table was crafted ' in situ ' from a single oak tree felled from the estate 's woods .
there is however a darker side to the tower .
so many ghostly experiences have been witnessed by the staff and visitors that an extensive record has been kept in a special ghost file .
beneath hoghton tower , reputedly the third most haunted house in britain , lies a warren of underground passages and dungeons , a reminder of the legend of the lancashire witches .
the building has many other interesting features including the tudor well house , 120 feet deep with horse-drawn pump and oaken winding gear .
the state bedroom contains the state bed carved in samlesbury -lrb- 1560-65 -rrb- .
the beautifully proportioned ball room with fine , decorative late victorian doors and panelling by gillows of lancaster .
the magnificent banqueting hall with windows containing 4,000 panes of flemish stained glass , original decorative ceiling and minstrels ' gallery .
leading off the minstrels ' gallery is the room containing an impressive collection of dolls ' houses .

a two-year suspension or a life ban ?
the sport was dealt a severe blow this week with the news of gareth hock 's positive drugs test .
the wigan second-rower has been provisionally suspended , after testing positive for cocaine following the game against salford on june 5th .
his ' b ' sample will be tested on 30th june .
of course we all hope that this will prove to be clear , but it has raised the question of what measures should be taken .
the accepted suspension is two years and rugby league extra 's studio guests adrian morley and kris radlinski both said that , should hock be found guilty , he has to be prepared to pay the price and face that penalty .

0161 228 2255 text : 07786 206951 email : manchestersports @ bbc.co.uk find out more about how to contact bbc radio manchester jack dearden asked if a two-year ban is enough in these situations .
he believes that there should be a policy of zero tolerance in all sports ie if you are proven to have taken drugs , you should be banned for life .
this prompted a debate in our studio - one which continued long after our final hooter .
trev , kris and adrian all believe in a second chance ; that sportsmen should only be thrown out should they re-offend .
the challenge is how to stop it happening in the first place .
would a zero tolerance policy act as a bigger deterrent ?
do we have to make bigger examples of cheats to teach youngsters that it can never be acceptable under any circumstances ?
or do we look to rehabilitate , allowing offenders to serve their punishment and reform ?
and does it matter if it is a social drug or a performance enhancing substance ?
thrown to the wolves ?
this week also saw ritchie myler turn down a lucrative contract offer at salford .
like all reds fans , i was sad , although not surprised , to hear the news .
sean mcrae told us that myler is under contract at the club until 2010 , and hopes something can be done .
but adrian morley may have let the ' cat out of the bag ' , admitting it looks like he may be heading to warrington .
-lrb- does he know something ? -rrb-
trev and jack both agreed with robbie paul , who told us that it could be in the best interests of both the youngster and salford for him to be sold .
it would give the club a cash injection , whilst giving the player a better chance of winning silverware imminently .
adrian morley believes that his decision depends on what makes him tick : money , trophies , loyalty or something else .
if you were myler - what would you do ?
if you were in charge of the club , would you cash in ?

a two-year suspension or a life ban ?
the sport was dealt a severe blow this week with the news of gareth hock 's positive drugs test .
the wigan second-rower has been provisionally suspended , after testing positive for cocaine following the game against salford on june 5th .
his ' b ' sample will be tested on 30th june .
of course we all hope that this will prove to be clear , but it has raised the question of what measures should be taken .
the accepted suspension is two years and rugby league extra 's studio guests adrian morley and kris radlinski both said that , should hock be found guilty , he has to be prepared to pay the price and face that penalty .
get in touch tel .
0161 228 2255 text : 07786 206951 email : manchestersports @ bbc.co.uk find out more about how to contact bbc radio manchester jack dearden asked if a two-year ban is enough in these situations .
he believes that there should be a policy of zero tolerance in all sports ie if you are proven to have taken drugs , you should be banned for life .
this prompted a debate in our studio - one which continued long after our final hooter .
trev , kris and adrian all believe in a second chance ; that sportsmen should only be thrown out should they re-offend .
the challenge is how to stop it happening in the first place .
would a zero tolerance policy act as a bigger deterrent ?
do we have to make bigger examples of cheats to teach youngsters that it can never be acceptable under any circumstances ?
or do we look to rehabilitate , allowing offenders to serve their punishment and reform ?
and does it matter if it is a social drug or a performance enhancing substance ?
thrown to the wolves ?
this week also saw ritchie myler turn down a lucrative contract offer at salford .
like all reds fans , i was sad , although not surprised , to hear the news .
sean mcrae told us that myler is under contract at the club until 2010 , and hopes something can be done .
but adrian morley may have let the ' cat out of the bag ' , admitting it looks like he may be heading to warrington .
-lrb- does he know something ? -rrb-
trev and jack both agreed with robbie paul , who told us that it could be in the best interests of both the youngster and salford for him to be sold .
it would give the club a cash injection , whilst giving the player a better chance of winning silverware imminently .
adrian morley believes that his decision depends on what makes him tick : money , trophies , loyalty or something else .
if you were myler - what would you do ?
if you were in charge of the club , would you cash in ?

the council has already agreed to make £ 13m worth of savings this year .
but its budget leader david alston said there was expected to be a reduction in the level of funding passed down from the uk government via the scottish one .
he said all departments would examine where cutbacks could be made and he did not rule out some school closures .
the ruling administration set a budget of £ 598m for 2009/10 , with councillors warning that cuts and job loses would have to be made .
the authority has also previously warned that it can not meet demands for new housing from the public .
in february , highland froze council tax levels for the second year running .
