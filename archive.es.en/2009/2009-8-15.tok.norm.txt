the attack comes just days before afghanistan 's national elections . the suicide car bomb was detonated near the gate of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- office in the wazir akbar khan district , where most of the major foreign embassies and organizations are located in afghanistan 's capital .
" unfortunately , there are casualties , " said canadian brigadier general eric tremblay , an isaf spokesman .
" there are afghan civilians and there are isaf military . "
taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid confirmed that the taliban was behind the bombing .
" it was carried out by one of our hero mujahid , ahmad , and the target was the us embassy and nato headquarters , " mujahid said in a telephone interview with the german news agency dpa .
the blast blew out windows and rattled building in the neighborhood and a large cloud of smoke rose from the site of the attack over kabul .
it also rattled the confidence of a nation preparing for only its second ever direct presidential election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the us have increased troop levels security in kabul and across the country has been tightened in advance of the august 20 polls , with 30,000 extra american troops in place .
security forces have increased their patrols and set up new checkpoints in kabul .
worries for election day but many observers and afghan civilians fear that the country is still not secure enough for an election .
despite the relative calm over the last several months , the taliban has conducted over 20 attacks against politicians taking part in the elections .
incumbent president hamid karzai 's running mate mohammad qasim fahin was attacked by militants in northern afghanistan and one cameraman was wounded .
two workers of karzai 's main challenger , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , were killed by gunmen .
" the government says it will install the polling stations in secure areas like the center of the district , but how can we go there from our village ? " asked rahim jan kako from the zherai district in southern afghanistan .
" i voted last time despite threats , but what the election brought us was killing and destruction . "
independent election commission officials said this week that elections would not be able to be held in 10 districts unless those areas were secured .
a mass abstention from the vote is currently being predicted by analysts .
such a low turnout could lead the new government to lack legitimacy in the eyes of the afghan people. hf / dpa / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the group said friday the plan had not yet been finalized and would take a few more days to complete .
cengiz kapmaz , spokesman for the defense team for jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan , who has been incarcerated on imrali island since his 1999 conviction , confirmed that the roadmap would need more time .
" ocalan 's lawyers have not finished writing up his statements , " he said .
" the lawyers will return to the island on wednesday . "
the pkk plan , devised by ocalan , coincides with efforts by ankara to draw up kurdish-friendly policies in an attempt to win over the minority population and encourage the pkk to give up its armed struggle .
progress on the matter is considered integral to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
" by the end of the year we will begin with those measures of the kurdish initiative that can be implemented , " said turkish prime minister tayyip on friday .
although the turkish government has been urged to consider the ocalan plan , ankara has repeatedly refused to meet with officials from the pkk , which it , too , considers a terrorist organization .
the pkk is seeking autonomy for the kurdish minority in turkey , estimated at around 12 million people mainly in the east and southeast of the country .

but the group said friday the plan had not yet been finalized and would take a few more days to complete .
cengiz kapmaz , spokesman for the defense team for jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan , who has been incarcerated on imrali island since his 1999 conviction , confirmed that the roadmap would need more time .
" ocalan 's lawyers have not finished writing up his statements , " he said .
" the lawyers will return to the island on wednesday . "
the pkk plan , devised by ocalan , coincides with efforts by ankara to draw up kurdish-friendly policies in an attempt to win over the minority population and encourage the pkk to give up its armed struggle .
progress on the matter is considered integral to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
" by the end of the year we will begin with those measures of the kurdish initiative that can be implemented , " said turkish prime minister tayyip on friday .
although the turkish government has been urged to consider the ocalan plan , ankara has repeatedly refused to meet with officials from the pkk , which it , too , considers a terrorist organization .
the pkk is seeking autonomy for the kurdish minority in turkey , estimated at around 12 million people mainly in the east and southeast of the country .

substitute elson slotted home the resultant spot-kick .
mohamadou idrissou gave freiburg hope with a header but elson responded almost immediately with a superb strike from outside the area 14 minutes from time to make it 3-1 .
there was still time for idrissou to reduce the deficit once again but julian shieber made it 4-2 a minute from time to ensure markus babbel 's side all three points .
the win was overshadowed by the news that stuttgart midfielder martin lanig will be out of action until the new year after sustaining cruciate ligament damage .

rivals bayern munich meanwhile had to settle for a draw at home to werder bremen . fabrice ehret gave cologne the lead four minutes into the second interval , but edin dzeko equalized for wolfsburg on 74 minutes .
wolfsburg then grabbed the lead when pierre wome netted in his own goal a minute later .
substitute obafemi martins made it 3-1 with three minutes remaining , all but destroying hopes of a late cologne comeback .
in munich , young german international midfielder mesut ozil gave bremen the lead but mario gomez brought bayern back into the contest with a goal midway through the second half .
the results see wolfsburg move to six points from two games , two clear of eintracht frankfurt and sv hamburg , who demolished borussia dortmund 4-1 .
bayern languish in 10th spot , four points off the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ozil was bremen 's lone scorer away from home attacking soccer the clash between hamburg and dortmund promised fireworks and after a frantic first 12 minutes the match seemed to be heading in that direction .
hamburg 's guy demel tapped in after just three minutes to put the home side ahead , but dortmund leveled just two minutes later through nelson valdez .
that goal was soon nullified however by quick strikes from new purchase ze roberto and jose paolo guerrero .
substitute marcus berg was on the pitch just three minutes when he scored a fourth goal for hamburg to give bruno labbadia 's men an unassailable three goal buffer .

substitute elson slotted home the resultant spot-kick .
mohamadou idrissou gave freiburg hope with a header but elson responded almost immediately with a superb strike from outside the area 14 minutes from time to make it 3-1 .
there was still time for idrissou to reduce the deficit once again but julian shieber made it 4-2 a minute from time to ensure markus babbel 's side all three points .
the win was overshadowed by the news that stuttgart midfielder martin lanig will be out of action until the new year after sustaining cruciate ligament damage .

but according to dw 's ingo manteufel , it was also part of merkel 's election campaign . how times have changed .
when german chancellor angela merkel met with russian president dmitry medvedev a year ago in sochi , the mood was icy .
the russia-georgia war had severely damaged relations between moscow and berlin .
but even though differences concerning georgia and russia 's conduct in the caucuses continue to exist , thanks to the global financial and economic crisis , the situation has visibly changed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel now both sides have called a truce and want to start rebuilding a strategic partnership .
the goal is to cooperate closely on several projects – saving the german auto company opel , helping preserve the waden yards collection of ship yards , and ensuring the continued existence of chip maker infinion .
but the declaration of intent for better german-russo economic cooperation was n't the surprising outcome of merkel 's visit to sochi .
germany and russia announced months ago that they planned to get through the economic crisis by working more together .
that fact was most recently made evident during a meeting between merkel and mevedev in munich one month ago .
inter-political chess match more interesting was the fact that merkel was able to use the trip to sochi to one-up her current vice chancellor and opponent for the chancellery , frank-walter steinmeier .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- may be in the lead six weeks ahead of federal elections in germany , but they have n't won yet , and every foreign trip is like a mini election campaign .
that 's even more true when it comes to visits with russian presidents .
ever since the male bonding that took place between gerhard schroeder and vladimir putin , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have tried to keep everything that has to do with russia in german politics all to themselves – even more so when it comes to frank-walter steinmeier .
over the past few years he has been a frequent and welcome guest at the kremlin , even during times of crisis .
under his leadership as foreign minister , the foreign ministry developed and propagated the concept of a german-russo modernization partnership , which is focused on linking the german and russian economies .
good relationships despite criticism with this trip to sochi focused on partnerships and cooperation merkel has taken this trump card away from steinmeier just weeks ahead of the elections .
what 's more is the fact that merkel demonstrated how good her relationship to president mevedev is while at the same time – as was clearly shown in the media – expressing her opinion about human rights in chechnya , which has clearly set her apart from steinmeier and his political foster father gerhard schroeder .
especially since the social democrats have always been criticized about their russia policies , which are seen as not critical enough when it comes to authoritarian tendencies and democratic deficits in russia .
the visit to sochi was a real political feat for merkel .
she reinforced a good political relationship with russia and made it clear she was supporting german jobs while at the same time taking the wind out of her opponent 's sails .
the fact that russian president medvedev willingly cooperated is n't only about the russian interest in opel .
even he must be aware of the polls in germany showing merkel in the lead and wants to be able to cash in on the good relations over the next four years .

but even though differences concerning georgia and russia 's conduct in the caucuses continue to exist , thanks to the global financial and economic crisis , the situation has visibly changed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel now both sides have called a truce and want to start rebuilding a strategic partnership .
the goal is to cooperate closely on several projects – saving the german auto company opel , helping preserve the waden yards collection of ship yards , and ensuring the continued existence of chip maker infinion .
but the declaration of intent for better german-russo economic cooperation was n't the surprising outcome of merkel 's visit to sochi .
germany and russia announced months ago that they planned to get through the economic crisis by working more together .
that fact was most recently made evident during a meeting between merkel and mevedev in munich one month ago .
inter-political chess match more interesting was the fact that merkel was able to use the trip to sochi to one-up her current vice chancellor and opponent for the chancellery , frank-walter steinmeier .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- may be in the lead six weeks ahead of federal elections in germany , but they have n't won yet , and every foreign trip is like a mini election campaign .
that 's even more true when it comes to visits with russian presidents .
ever since the male bonding that took place between gerhard schroeder and vladimir putin , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have tried to keep everything that has to do with russia in german politics all to themselves – even more so when it comes to frank-walter steinmeier .
over the past few years he has been a frequent and welcome guest at the kremlin , even during times of crisis .
under his leadership as foreign minister , the foreign ministry developed and propagated the concept of a german-russo modernization partnership , which is focused on linking the german and russian economies .
good relationships despite criticism with this trip to sochi focused on partnerships and cooperation merkel has taken this trump card away from steinmeier just weeks ahead of the elections .
what 's more is the fact that merkel demonstrated how good her relationship to president mevedev is while at the same time – as was clearly shown in the media – expressing her opinion about human rights in chechnya , which has clearly set her apart from steinmeier and his political foster father gerhard schroeder .
especially since the social democrats have always been criticized about their russia policies , which are seen as not critical enough when it comes to authoritarian tendencies and democratic deficits in russia .
the visit to sochi was a real political feat for merkel .
she reinforced a good political relationship with russia and made it clear she was supporting german jobs while at the same time taking the wind out of her opponent 's sails .
the fact that russian president medvedev willingly cooperated is n't only about the russian interest in opel .
even he must be aware of the polls in germany showing merkel in the lead and wants to be able to cash in on the good relations over the next four years .

the attack comes just days before afghanistan 's national elections . the suicide car bomb was detonated near the gate of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- office in the wazir akbar khan district , where most of the major foreign embassies and organizations are located in afghanistan 's capital .
" unfortunately , there are casualties , " said canadian brigadier general eric tremblay , an isaf spokesman .
" there are afghan civilians and there are isaf military . "
taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid confirmed that the taliban was behind the bombing .
" it was carried out by one of our hero mujahid , ahmad , and the target was the us embassy and nato headquarters , " mujahid said in a telephone interview with the german news agency dpa .

the rest , as they say , is history . it was june , 1969 , and 24-year-old cologne native dieter frowein-lyasso had just finished his military service with the german army .
american soldiers stationed in the area told him about a big music festival happening in woodstock , near new york .
and he knew immediately - he had to go .
" i remember thinking that i had to get away from all the uniforms , the command structures , the obedience of the military , and that the best way to do that would be to mingle with people from a completely different world , " says frowein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein was looking for a release following military service the music lover promptly booked himself on a flight to new york .
he kept his plans secret , as he was determined to travel alone .
he used the money he got from the army as compensation for completing his military service to pay for the flight .
after arriving in new york , frowein found accommodation in a youth hostel , where he met a group of young people from the midwest who were also going to the festival .
" they simply took me along , because they thought it was so unusual that someone had come all the way from germany , " frowein says .
the only problem was , no one knew the way .
and when they finally did arrive in woodstock , they had a surprise waiting for them .
" woodstock ?
not here ! "
frowein remembers .
" instead , it was all taking place in the next town , which was bethel .
the people of woodstock did n't want to host it after all , so the organizers moved it the whole show to bethel , which is about three kilometers from woodstock . "
sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso says he stood out from the hippies frowein could n't speak much english , and his clothes were also very different from the styles worn by the " hippies " who had descended on the venue .
although he was dressed " normally , " he recalls feeling at home in the exotic surroundings .
" i was n't shy , and so i was able to really enjoy myself , " he says .
" i wandered around and looked at the people .
everyone said ' hello ' or ' hi ' and that was it .
i just soaked up this incredible atmosphere . "
he did n't have much to eat or drink during the festival , and the continuous downpour was a nuisance , because while others had tents and camping equipment with them , frowein had nothing but his rain slicker .
he also did n't know quite what to make of the rampant drug use or the concept of free love .
" of course some people were running around in the nude , but that did n't really interest me , " he says .
" i was there to hear the music and to mingle with these people and see how they lived .
sex and drugs were part of it , but that did n't bother me . "
one of the main topics of conversation was the moon landing , which happened shortly before woodstock .
but for frowein , it was of little significance , being " too military " for his liking .
all that mattered was being able to experience first-hand the music greats of the day .
" when janis joplin died of an overdose not long after the festival , at least i was able to say that i had seen her perform live - that was very important for me , " he remembers .
cherished memories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso treasures the experience of woodstock after three days , frowein hit the road .
he hitchhiked back to new york and boarded a plane to germany .
back home , he saw how woodstock had become a huge media event , and how the music featured there was being played in all the bars and clubs .
he does n't often tell people that he was there - they would n't believe him anyway , he says .
today , dieter frowein manages an art supply shop in cologne .
in 1996 , he revisited the festival grounds in bethel , and took photos of the site .
but the real memories of those three crazy days full of music and colorful people in 1969 are firmly anchored in his mind .
" one thing 's for certain , " he says .
" the whole experience sure helped to blow off the stodginess of my time with the german army ! "

the rest , as they say , is history . it was june , 1969 , and 24-year-old cologne native dieter frowein-lyasso had just finished his military service with the german army .
american soldiers stationed in the area told him about a big music festival happening in woodstock , near new york .
and he knew immediately - he had to go .
" i remember thinking that i had to get away from all the uniforms , the command structures , the obedience of the military , and that the best way to do that would be to mingle with people from a completely different world , " says frowein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein was looking for a release following military service the music lover promptly booked himself on a flight to new york .
he kept his plans secret , as he was determined to travel alone .
he used the money he got from the army as compensation for completing his military service to pay for the flight .
after arriving in new york , frowein found accommodation in a youth hostel , where he met a group of young people from the midwest who were also going to the festival .
" they simply took me along , because they thought it was so unusual that someone had come all the way from germany , " frowein says .
the only problem was , no one knew the way .
and when they finally did arrive in woodstock , they had a surprise waiting for them .
" woodstock ?
not here ! "
frowein remembers .
" instead , it was all taking place in the next town , which was bethel .
the people of woodstock did n't want to host it after all , so the organizers moved it the whole show to bethel , which is about three kilometers from woodstock . "
sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso says he stood out from the hippies frowein could n't speak much english , and his clothes were also very different from the styles worn by the " hippies " who had descended on the venue .
although he was dressed " normally , " he recalls feeling at home in the exotic surroundings .
" i was n't shy , and so i was able to really enjoy myself , " he says .
" i wandered around and looked at the people .
everyone said ' hello ' or ' hi ' and that was it .
i just soaked up this incredible atmosphere . "
he did n't have much to eat or drink during the festival , and the continuous downpour was a nuisance , because while others had tents and camping equipment with them , frowein had nothing but his rain slicker .
he also did n't know quite what to make of the rampant drug use or the concept of free love .
" of course some people were running around in the nude , but that did n't really interest me , " he says .
" i was there to hear the music and to mingle with these people and see how they lived .
sex and drugs were part of it , but that did n't bother me . "
one of the main topics of conversation was the moon landing , which happened shortly before woodstock .
but for frowein , it was of little significance , being " too military " for his liking .

but the group said friday the plan had not yet been finalized and would take a few more days to complete .
cengiz kapmaz , spokesman for the defense team for jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan , who has been incarcerated on imrali island since his 1999 conviction , confirmed that the roadmap would need more time .
" ocalan 's lawyers have not finished writing up his statements , " he said .
" the lawyers will return to the island on wednesday . "
the pkk plan , devised by ocalan , coincides with efforts by ankara to draw up kurdish-friendly policies in an attempt to win over the minority population and encourage the pkk to give up its armed struggle .
progress on the matter is considered integral to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
" by the end of the year we will begin with those measures of the kurdish initiative that can be implemented , " said turkish prime minister tayyip on friday .
although the turkish government has been urged to consider the ocalan plan , ankara has repeatedly refused to meet with officials from the pkk , which it , too , considers a terrorist organization .
the pkk is seeking autonomy for the kurdish minority in turkey , estimated at around 12 million people mainly in the east and southeast of the country .

but the group said friday the plan had not yet been finalized and would take a few more days to complete .
cengiz kapmaz , spokesman for the defense team for jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan , who has been incarcerated on imrali island since his 1999 conviction , confirmed that the roadmap would need more time .
" ocalan 's lawyers have not finished writing up his statements , " he said .
" the lawyers will return to the island on wednesday . "
the pkk plan , devised by ocalan , coincides with efforts by ankara to draw up kurdish-friendly policies in an attempt to win over the minority population and encourage the pkk to give up its armed struggle .
progress on the matter is considered integral to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
" by the end of the year we will begin with those measures of the kurdish initiative that can be implemented , " said turkish prime minister tayyip on friday .
although the turkish government has been urged to consider the ocalan plan , ankara has repeatedly refused to meet with officials from the pkk , which it , too , considers a terrorist organization .
the pkk is seeking autonomy for the kurdish minority in turkey , estimated at around 12 million people mainly in the east and southeast of the country .
according to estimates , the conflict has claimed as many as 45,000 lives. dfm / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.08.2009 opinion : merkel 's trip to sotchi about more than relations with russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting between rusian president dmitry medvedev and german chancellor angela merkel in sochi was heavy on german-russo relations .
but according to dw 's ingo manteufel , it was also part of merkel 's election campaign . how times have changed .
when german chancellor angela merkel met with russian president dmitry medvedev a year ago in sochi , the mood was icy .
the russia-georgia war had severely damaged relations between moscow and berlin .
but even though differences concerning georgia and russia 's conduct in the caucuses continue to exist , thanks to the global financial and economic crisis , the situation has visibly changed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel now both sides have called a truce and want to start rebuilding a strategic partnership .
the goal is to cooperate closely on several projects – saving the german auto company opel , helping preserve the waden yards collection of ship yards , and ensuring the continued existence of chip maker infinion .
but the declaration of intent for better german-russo economic cooperation was n't the surprising outcome of merkel 's visit to sochi .
germany and russia announced months ago that they planned to get through the economic crisis by working more together .
that fact was most recently made evident during a meeting between merkel and mevedev in munich one month ago .
inter-political chess match more interesting was the fact that merkel was able to use the trip to sochi to one-up her current vice chancellor and opponent for the chancellery , frank-walter steinmeier .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- may be in the lead six weeks ahead of federal elections in germany , but they have n't won yet , and every foreign trip is like a mini election campaign .
that 's even more true when it comes to visits with russian presidents .
ever since the male bonding that took place between gerhard schroeder and vladimir putin , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have tried to keep everything that has to do with russia in german politics all to themselves – even more so when it comes to frank-walter steinmeier .
over the past few years he has been a frequent and welcome guest at the kremlin , even during times of crisis .
under his leadership as foreign minister , the foreign ministry developed and propagated the concept of a german-russo modernization partnership , which is focused on linking the german and russian economies .
good relationships despite criticism with this trip to sochi focused on partnerships and cooperation merkel has taken this trump card away from steinmeier just weeks ahead of the elections .
what 's more is the fact that merkel demonstrated how good her relationship to president mevedev is while at the same time – as was clearly shown in the media – expressing her opinion about human rights in chechnya , which has clearly set her apart from steinmeier and his political foster father gerhard schroeder .
especially since the social democrats have always been criticized about their russia policies , which are seen as not critical enough when it comes to authoritarian tendencies and democratic deficits in russia .
the visit to sochi was a real political feat for merkel .
she reinforced a good political relationship with russia and made it clear she was supporting german jobs while at the same time taking the wind out of her opponent 's sails .
the fact that russian president medvedev willingly cooperated is n't only about the russian interest in opel .
even he must be aware of the polls in germany showing merkel in the lead and wants to be able to cash in on the good relations over the next four years .

rivals bayern munich meanwhile had to settle for a draw at home to werder bremen . fabrice ehret gave cologne the lead four minutes into the second interval , but edin dzeko equalized for wolfsburg on 74 minutes .
wolfsburg then grabbed the lead when pierre wome netted in his own goal a minute later .
substitute obafemi martins made it 3-1 with three minutes remaining , all but destroying hopes of a late cologne comeback .
in munich , young german international midfielder mesut ozil gave bremen the lead but mario gomez brought bayern back into the contest with a goal midway through the second half .
the results see wolfsburg move to six points from two games , two clear of eintracht frankfurt and sv hamburg , who demolished borussia dortmund 4-1 .
bayern languish in 10th spot , four points off the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ozil was bremen 's lone scorer away from home attacking soccer the clash between hamburg and dortmund promised fireworks and after a frantic first 12 minutes the match seemed to be heading in that direction .
hamburg 's guy demel tapped in after just three minutes to put the home side ahead , but dortmund leveled just two minutes later through nelson valdez .
that goal was soon nullified however by quick strikes from new purchase ze roberto and jose paolo guerrero .
substitute marcus berg was on the pitch just three minutes when he scored a fourth goal for hamburg to give bruno labbadia 's men an unassailable three goal buffer .
lanig out vfb stuttgart meanwhile bounced back from a loss to wolfsburg last week with a 4-2 victory over neighbors sc freiburg .

pogrebnyak was also involved in stuttgart 's second on 65 minutes when the striker was judged to have been fouled in the area by freiburg goalkeeper manuel salz .
substitute elson slotted home the resultant spot-kick .
mohamadou idrissou gave freiburg hope with a header but elson responded almost immediately with a superb strike from outside the area 14 minutes from time to make it 3-1 .
there was still time for idrissou to reduce the deficit once again but julian shieber made it 4-2 a minute from time to ensure markus babbel 's side all three points .
the win was overshadowed by the news that stuttgart midfielder martin lanig will be out of action until the new year after sustaining cruciate ligament damage .
draws galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling scored the only goal of the game to give leverkusen victory bayer leverkusen celebrated their return to the newly renovated bayarena following the completion of a 70-million-euro -lrb- $ 99 million -rrb- upgrade with a 1-0 victory over tsg hoffenheim .

but according to dw 's ingo manteufel , it was also part of merkel 's election campaign . how times have changed .
when german chancellor angela merkel met with russian president dmitry medvedev a year ago in sochi , the mood was icy .
the russia-georgia war had severely damaged relations between moscow and berlin .
but even though differences concerning georgia and russia 's conduct in the caucuses continue to exist , thanks to the global financial and economic crisis , the situation has visibly changed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel now both sides have called a truce and want to start rebuilding a strategic partnership .
the goal is to cooperate closely on several projects – saving the german auto company opel , helping preserve the waden yards collection of ship yards , and ensuring the continued existence of chip maker infinion .
but the declaration of intent for better german-russo economic cooperation was n't the surprising outcome of merkel 's visit to sochi .
germany and russia announced months ago that they planned to get through the economic crisis by working more together .
that fact was most recently made evident during a meeting between merkel and mevedev in munich one month ago .
inter-political chess match more interesting was the fact that merkel was able to use the trip to sochi to one-up her current vice chancellor and opponent for the chancellery , frank-walter steinmeier .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- may be in the lead six weeks ahead of federal elections in germany , but they have n't won yet , and every foreign trip is like a mini election campaign .
that 's even more true when it comes to visits with russian presidents .
ever since the male bonding that took place between gerhard schroeder and vladimir putin , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have tried to keep everything that has to do with russia in german politics all to themselves – even more so when it comes to frank-walter steinmeier .
over the past few years he has been a frequent and welcome guest at the kremlin , even during times of crisis .
under his leadership as foreign minister , the foreign ministry developed and propagated the concept of a german-russo modernization partnership , which is focused on linking the german and russian economies .
good relationships despite criticism with this trip to sochi focused on partnerships and cooperation merkel has taken this trump card away from steinmeier just weeks ahead of the elections .
what 's more is the fact that merkel demonstrated how good her relationship to president mevedev is while at the same time – as was clearly shown in the media – expressing her opinion about human rights in chechnya , which has clearly set her apart from steinmeier and his political foster father gerhard schroeder .
especially since the social democrats have always been criticized about their russia policies , which are seen as not critical enough when it comes to authoritarian tendencies and democratic deficits in russia .
the visit to sochi was a real political feat for merkel .
she reinforced a good political relationship with russia and made it clear she was supporting german jobs while at the same time taking the wind out of her opponent 's sails .
the fact that russian president medvedev willingly cooperated is n't only about the russian interest in opel .
even he must be aware of the polls in germany showing merkel in the lead and wants to be able to cash in on the good relations over the next four years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 15.08.2009 remembering woodstock , 40 years on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso experienced the hedonism first-hand forty years ago , dieter frowein-lyasso was an ex-army recruit looking for a way to blow off some steam when he heard about a music festival taking place in a town called woodstock .
the rest , as they say , is history . it was june , 1969 , and 24-year-old cologne native dieter frowein-lyasso had just finished his military service with the german army .
american soldiers stationed in the area told him about a big music festival happening in woodstock , near new york .
and he knew immediately - he had to go .
" i remember thinking that i had to get away from all the uniforms , the command structures , the obedience of the military , and that the best way to do that would be to mingle with people from a completely different world , " says frowein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein was looking for a release following military service the music lover promptly booked himself on a flight to new york .
he kept his plans secret , as he was determined to travel alone .
he used the money he got from the army as compensation for completing his military service to pay for the flight .
after arriving in new york , frowein found accommodation in a youth hostel , where he met a group of young people from the midwest who were also going to the festival .
" they simply took me along , because they thought it was so unusual that someone had come all the way from germany , " frowein says .
the only problem was , no one knew the way .
and when they finally did arrive in woodstock , they had a surprise waiting for them .
" woodstock ?
not here ! "
frowein remembers .
" instead , it was all taking place in the next town , which was bethel .
the people of woodstock did n't want to host it after all , so the organizers moved it the whole show to bethel , which is about three kilometers from woodstock . "
sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso says he stood out from the hippies frowein could n't speak much english , and his clothes were also very different from the styles worn by the " hippies " who had descended on the venue .
although he was dressed " normally , " he recalls feeling at home in the exotic surroundings .
" i was n't shy , and so i was able to really enjoy myself , " he says .
" i wandered around and looked at the people .
everyone said ' hello ' or ' hi ' and that was it .
i just soaked up this incredible atmosphere . "
he did n't have much to eat or drink during the festival , and the continuous downpour was a nuisance , because while others had tents and camping equipment with them , frowein had nothing but his rain slicker .
he also did n't know quite what to make of the rampant drug use or the concept of free love .
" of course some people were running around in the nude , but that did n't really interest me , " he says .
" i was there to hear the music and to mingle with these people and see how they lived .
sex and drugs were part of it , but that did n't bother me . "
one of the main topics of conversation was the moon landing , which happened shortly before woodstock .
but for frowein , it was of little significance , being " too military " for his liking .
all that mattered was being able to experience first-hand the music greats of the day .
" when janis joplin died of an overdose not long after the festival , at least i was able to say that i had seen her perform live - that was very important for me , " he remembers .
cherished memories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso treasures the experience of woodstock after three days , frowein hit the road .
he hitchhiked back to new york and boarded a plane to germany .
back home , he saw how woodstock had become a huge media event , and how the music featured there was being played in all the bars and clubs .

but the group said friday the plan had not yet been finalized and would take a few more days to complete .
cengiz kapmaz , spokesman for the defense team for jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan , who has been incarcerated on imrali island since his 1999 conviction , confirmed that the roadmap would need more time .
" ocalan 's lawyers have not finished writing up his statements , " he said .
" the lawyers will return to the island on wednesday . "
the pkk plan , devised by ocalan , coincides with efforts by ankara to draw up kurdish-friendly policies in an attempt to win over the minority population and encourage the pkk to give up its armed struggle .
progress on the matter is considered integral to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
" by the end of the year we will begin with those measures of the kurdish initiative that can be implemented , " said turkish prime minister tayyip on friday .
although the turkish government has been urged to consider the ocalan plan , ankara has repeatedly refused to meet with officials from the pkk , which it , too , considers a terrorist organization .
the pkk is seeking autonomy for the kurdish minority in turkey , estimated at around 12 million people mainly in the east and southeast of the country .
according to estimates , the conflict has claimed as many as 45,000 lives. dfm / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's andre hoehne came in a disappointing 14th place , after finishing fourth in the last world championships .
" it was really a great setting for the race .
it was berlin 's proposal and we were very reluctant , at first .
i am glad we listened to berlin , " said competition director paul hardy from the governing body iaaf .
on friday , the german capital hosted a welcoming party for the more than 2,000 athletes .

the rest , as they say , is history . it was june , 1969 , and 24-year-old cologne native dieter frowein-lyasso had just finished his military service with the german army .
american soldiers stationed in the area told him about a big music festival happening in woodstock , near new york .
and he knew immediately - he had to go .
" i remember thinking that i had to get away from all the uniforms , the command structures , the obedience of the military , and that the best way to do that would be to mingle with people from a completely different world , " says frowein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein was looking for a release following military service the music lover promptly booked himself on a flight to new york .
he kept his plans secret , as he was determined to travel alone .
he used the money he got from the army as compensation for completing his military service to pay for the flight .
after arriving in new york , frowein found accommodation in a youth hostel , where he met a group of young people from the midwest who were also going to the festival .
" they simply took me along , because they thought it was so unusual that someone had come all the way from germany , " frowein says .
the only problem was , no one knew the way .
and when they finally did arrive in woodstock , they had a surprise waiting for them .
" woodstock ?
not here ! "
frowein remembers .
" instead , it was all taking place in the next town , which was bethel .
the people of woodstock did n't want to host it after all , so the organizers moved it the whole show to bethel , which is about three kilometers from woodstock . "
sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso says he stood out from the hippies frowein could n't speak much english , and his clothes were also very different from the styles worn by the " hippies " who had descended on the venue .
although he was dressed " normally , " he recalls feeling at home in the exotic surroundings .
" i was n't shy , and so i was able to really enjoy myself , " he says .
" i wandered around and looked at the people .
everyone said ' hello ' or ' hi ' and that was it .
i just soaked up this incredible atmosphere . "
he did n't have much to eat or drink during the festival , and the continuous downpour was a nuisance , because while others had tents and camping equipment with them , frowein had nothing but his rain slicker .
he also did n't know quite what to make of the rampant drug use or the concept of free love .
" of course some people were running around in the nude , but that did n't really interest me , " he says .
" i was there to hear the music and to mingle with these people and see how they lived .
sex and drugs were part of it , but that did n't bother me . "
one of the main topics of conversation was the moon landing , which happened shortly before woodstock .
but for frowein , it was of little significance , being " too military " for his liking .
all that mattered was being able to experience first-hand the music greats of the day .
" when janis joplin died of an overdose not long after the festival , at least i was able to say that i had seen her perform live - that was very important for me , " he remembers .

today , dieter frowein manages an art supply shop in cologne .
in 1996 , he revisited the festival grounds in bethel , and took photos of the site .
but the real memories of those three crazy days full of music and colorful people in 1969 are firmly anchored in his mind .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.08.2009 opinion : merkel 's trip to sotchi about more than relations with russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting between rusian president dmitry medvedev and german chancellor angela merkel in sochi was heavy on german-russo relations .
but according to dw 's ingo manteufel , it was also part of merkel 's election campaign . how times have changed .
when german chancellor angela merkel met with russian president dmitry medvedev a year ago in sochi , the mood was icy .
the russia-georgia war had severely damaged relations between moscow and berlin .
but even though differences concerning georgia and russia 's conduct in the caucuses continue to exist , thanks to the global financial and economic crisis , the situation has visibly changed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel now both sides have called a truce and want to start rebuilding a strategic partnership .
the goal is to cooperate closely on several projects – saving the german auto company opel , helping preserve the waden yards collection of ship yards , and ensuring the continued existence of chip maker infinion .
but the declaration of intent for better german-russo economic cooperation was n't the surprising outcome of merkel 's visit to sochi .
germany and russia announced months ago that they planned to get through the economic crisis by working more together .
that fact was most recently made evident during a meeting between merkel and mevedev in munich one month ago .
inter-political chess match more interesting was the fact that merkel was able to use the trip to sochi to one-up her current vice chancellor and opponent for the chancellery , frank-walter steinmeier .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- may be in the lead six weeks ahead of federal elections in germany , but they have n't won yet , and every foreign trip is like a mini election campaign .
that 's even more true when it comes to visits with russian presidents .
ever since the male bonding that took place between gerhard schroeder and vladimir putin , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have tried to keep everything that has to do with russia in german politics all to themselves – even more so when it comes to frank-walter steinmeier .
over the past few years he has been a frequent and welcome guest at the kremlin , even during times of crisis .
under his leadership as foreign minister , the foreign ministry developed and propagated the concept of a german-russo modernization partnership , which is focused on linking the german and russian economies .
good relationships despite criticism with this trip to sochi focused on partnerships and cooperation merkel has taken this trump card away from steinmeier just weeks ahead of the elections .
what 's more is the fact that merkel demonstrated how good her relationship to president mevedev is while at the same time – as was clearly shown in the media – expressing her opinion about human rights in chechnya , which has clearly set her apart from steinmeier and his political foster father gerhard schroeder .
especially since the social democrats have always been criticized about their russia policies , which are seen as not critical enough when it comes to authoritarian tendencies and democratic deficits in russia .
the visit to sochi was a real political feat for merkel .
she reinforced a good political relationship with russia and made it clear she was supporting german jobs while at the same time taking the wind out of her opponent 's sails .
the fact that russian president medvedev willingly cooperated is n't only about the russian interest in opel .
even he must be aware of the polls in germany showing merkel in the lead and wants to be able to cash in on the good relations over the next four years .

but the group said friday the plan had not yet been finalized and would take a few more days to complete .
cengiz kapmaz , spokesman for the defense team for jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan , who has been incarcerated on imrali island since his 1999 conviction , confirmed that the roadmap would need more time .
" ocalan 's lawyers have not finished writing up his statements , " he said .
" the lawyers will return to the island on wednesday . "
the pkk plan , devised by ocalan , coincides with efforts by ankara to draw up kurdish-friendly policies in an attempt to win over the minority population and encourage the pkk to give up its armed struggle .
progress on the matter is considered integral to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
" by the end of the year we will begin with those measures of the kurdish initiative that can be implemented , " said turkish prime minister tayyip on friday .
although the turkish government has been urged to consider the ocalan plan , ankara has repeatedly refused to meet with officials from the pkk , which it , too , considers a terrorist organization .
the pkk is seeking autonomy for the kurdish minority in turkey , estimated at around 12 million people mainly in the east and southeast of the country .
according to estimates , the conflict has claimed as many as 45,000 lives. dfm / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the group said friday the plan had not yet been finalized and would take a few more days to complete .
cengiz kapmaz , spokesman for the defense team for jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan , who has been incarcerated on imrali island since his 1999 conviction , confirmed that the roadmap would need more time .
" ocalan 's lawyers have not finished writing up his statements , " he said .
" the lawyers will return to the island on wednesday . "
the pkk plan , devised by ocalan , coincides with efforts by ankara to draw up kurdish-friendly policies in an attempt to win over the minority population and encourage the pkk to give up its armed struggle .
progress on the matter is considered integral to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
" by the end of the year we will begin with those measures of the kurdish initiative that can be implemented , " said turkish prime minister tayyip on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.08.2009 opinion : merkel 's trip to sotchi about more than relations with russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting between rusian president dmitry medvedev and german chancellor angela merkel in sochi was heavy on german-russo relations .
but according to dw 's ingo manteufel , it was also part of merkel 's election campaign . how times have changed .
when german chancellor angela merkel met with russian president dmitry medvedev a year ago in sochi , the mood was icy .
the russia-georgia war had severely damaged relations between moscow and berlin .
but even though differences concerning georgia and russia 's conduct in the caucuses continue to exist , thanks to the global financial and economic crisis , the situation has visibly changed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel now both sides have called a truce and want to start rebuilding a strategic partnership .
the goal is to cooperate closely on several projects – saving the german auto company opel , helping preserve the waden yards collection of ship yards , and ensuring the continued existence of chip maker infinion .
but the declaration of intent for better german-russo economic cooperation was n't the surprising outcome of merkel 's visit to sochi .
germany and russia announced months ago that they planned to get through the economic crisis by working more together .
that fact was most recently made evident during a meeting between merkel and mevedev in munich one month ago .
inter-political chess match more interesting was the fact that merkel was able to use the trip to sochi to one-up her current vice chancellor and opponent for the chancellery , frank-walter steinmeier .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- may be in the lead six weeks ahead of federal elections in germany , but they have n't won yet , and every foreign trip is like a mini election campaign .
that 's even more true when it comes to visits with russian presidents .
ever since the male bonding that took place between gerhard schroeder and vladimir putin , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have tried to keep everything that has to do with russia in german politics all to themselves – even more so when it comes to frank-walter steinmeier .
over the past few years he has been a frequent and welcome guest at the kremlin , even during times of crisis .
under his leadership as foreign minister , the foreign ministry developed and propagated the concept of a german-russo modernization partnership , which is focused on linking the german and russian economies .
good relationships despite criticism with this trip to sochi focused on partnerships and cooperation merkel has taken this trump card away from steinmeier just weeks ahead of the elections .
what 's more is the fact that merkel demonstrated how good her relationship to president mevedev is while at the same time – as was clearly shown in the media – expressing her opinion about human rights in chechnya , which has clearly set her apart from steinmeier and his political foster father gerhard schroeder .
especially since the social democrats have always been criticized about their russia policies , which are seen as not critical enough when it comes to authoritarian tendencies and democratic deficits in russia .
the visit to sochi was a real political feat for merkel .
she reinforced a good political relationship with russia and made it clear she was supporting german jobs while at the same time taking the wind out of her opponent 's sails .
the fact that russian president medvedev willingly cooperated is n't only about the russian interest in opel .
even he must be aware of the polls in germany showing merkel in the lead and wants to be able to cash in on the good relations over the next four years .

the rest , as they say , is history . it was june , 1969 , and 24-year-old cologne native dieter frowein-lyasso had just finished his military service with the german army .
american soldiers stationed in the area told him about a big music festival happening in woodstock , near new york .
and he knew immediately - he had to go .
" i remember thinking that i had to get away from all the uniforms , the command structures , the obedience of the military , and that the best way to do that would be to mingle with people from a completely different world , " says frowein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein was looking for a release following military service the music lover promptly booked himself on a flight to new york .
he kept his plans secret , as he was determined to travel alone .
he used the money he got from the army as compensation for completing his military service to pay for the flight .
after arriving in new york , frowein found accommodation in a youth hostel , where he met a group of young people from the midwest who were also going to the festival .
" they simply took me along , because they thought it was so unusual that someone had come all the way from germany , " frowein says .
the only problem was , no one knew the way .
and when they finally did arrive in woodstock , they had a surprise waiting for them .
" woodstock ?
not here ! "
frowein remembers .
" instead , it was all taking place in the next town , which was bethel .
the people of woodstock did n't want to host it after all , so the organizers moved it the whole show to bethel , which is about three kilometers from woodstock . "
sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso says he stood out from the hippies frowein could n't speak much english , and his clothes were also very different from the styles worn by the " hippies " who had descended on the venue .
although he was dressed " normally , " he recalls feeling at home in the exotic surroundings .
" i was n't shy , and so i was able to really enjoy myself , " he says .
" i wandered around and looked at the people .
everyone said ' hello ' or ' hi ' and that was it .
i just soaked up this incredible atmosphere . "
he did n't have much to eat or drink during the festival , and the continuous downpour was a nuisance , because while others had tents and camping equipment with them , frowein had nothing but his rain slicker .
he also did n't know quite what to make of the rampant drug use or the concept of free love .
" of course some people were running around in the nude , but that did n't really interest me , " he says .
" i was there to hear the music and to mingle with these people and see how they lived .
sex and drugs were part of it , but that did n't bother me . "
one of the main topics of conversation was the moon landing , which happened shortly before woodstock .
but for frowein , it was of little significance , being " too military " for his liking .
all that mattered was being able to experience first-hand the music greats of the day .
" when janis joplin died of an overdose not long after the festival , at least i was able to say that i had seen her perform live - that was very important for me , " he remembers .
cherished memories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso treasures the experience of woodstock after three days , frowein hit the road .
he hitchhiked back to new york and boarded a plane to germany .
back home , he saw how woodstock had become a huge media event , and how the music featured there was being played in all the bars and clubs .
he does n't often tell people that he was there - they would n't believe him anyway , he says .
today , dieter frowein manages an art supply shop in cologne .
in 1996 , he revisited the festival grounds in bethel , and took photos of the site .
but the real memories of those three crazy days full of music and colorful people in 1969 are firmly anchored in his mind .
" one thing 's for certain , " he says .
" the whole experience sure helped to blow off the stodginess of my time with the german army ! "

" they simply took me along , because they thought it was so unusual that someone had come all the way from germany , " frowein says .
the only problem was , no one knew the way .
and when they finally did arrive in woodstock , they had a surprise waiting for them .
" woodstock ?
not here ! "
frowein remembers .
" instead , it was all taking place in the next town , which was bethel .
the people of woodstock did n't want to host it after all , so the organizers moved it the whole show to bethel , which is about three kilometers from woodstock . "
sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso says he stood out from the hippies frowein could n't speak much english , and his clothes were also very different from the styles worn by the " hippies " who had descended on the venue .
although he was dressed " normally , " he recalls feeling at home in the exotic surroundings .
" i was n't shy , and so i was able to really enjoy myself , " he says .
" i wandered around and looked at the people .
everyone said ' hello ' or ' hi ' and that was it .
i just soaked up this incredible atmosphere . "
he did n't have much to eat or drink during the festival , and the continuous downpour was a nuisance , because while others had tents and camping equipment with them , frowein had nothing but his rain slicker .
he also did n't know quite what to make of the rampant drug use or the concept of free love .
" of course some people were running around in the nude , but that did n't really interest me , " he says .
" i was there to hear the music and to mingle with these people and see how they lived .
sex and drugs were part of it , but that did n't bother me . "
one of the main topics of conversation was the moon landing , which happened shortly before woodstock .
but for frowein , it was of little significance , being " too military " for his liking .
all that mattered was being able to experience first-hand the music greats of the day .
" when janis joplin died of an overdose not long after the festival , at least i was able to say that i had seen her perform live - that was very important for me , " he remembers .
cherished memories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso treasures the experience of woodstock after three days , frowein hit the road .
he hitchhiked back to new york and boarded a plane to germany .
back home , he saw how woodstock had become a huge media event , and how the music featured there was being played in all the bars and clubs .
he does n't often tell people that he was there - they would n't believe him anyway , he says .
today , dieter frowein manages an art supply shop in cologne .
in 1996 , he revisited the festival grounds in bethel , and took photos of the site .
but the real memories of those three crazy days full of music and colorful people in 1969 are firmly anchored in his mind .
" one thing 's for certain , " he says .
" the whole experience sure helped to blow off the stodginess of my time with the german army ! "

but according to dw 's ingo manteufel , it was also part of merkel 's election campaign . how times have changed .
when german chancellor angela merkel met with russian president dmitry medvedev a year ago in sochi , the mood was icy .
the russia-georgia war had severely damaged relations between moscow and berlin .
but even though differences concerning georgia and russia 's conduct in the caucuses continue to exist , thanks to the global financial and economic crisis , the situation has visibly changed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel now both sides have called a truce and want to start rebuilding a strategic partnership .
the goal is to cooperate closely on several projects – saving the german auto company opel , helping preserve the waden yards collection of ship yards , and ensuring the continued existence of chip maker infinion .
but the declaration of intent for better german-russo economic cooperation was n't the surprising outcome of merkel 's visit to sochi .
germany and russia announced months ago that they planned to get through the economic crisis by working more together .
that fact was most recently made evident during a meeting between merkel and mevedev in munich one month ago .
inter-political chess match more interesting was the fact that merkel was able to use the trip to sochi to one-up her current vice chancellor and opponent for the chancellery , frank-walter steinmeier .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- may be in the lead six weeks ahead of federal elections in germany , but they have n't won yet , and every foreign trip is like a mini election campaign .
that 's even more true when it comes to visits with russian presidents .
ever since the male bonding that took place between gerhard schroeder and vladimir putin , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have tried to keep everything that has to do with russia in german politics all to themselves – even more so when it comes to frank-walter steinmeier .
over the past few years he has been a frequent and welcome guest at the kremlin , even during times of crisis .
under his leadership as foreign minister , the foreign ministry developed and propagated the concept of a german-russo modernization partnership , which is focused on linking the german and russian economies .
good relationships despite criticism with this trip to sochi focused on partnerships and cooperation merkel has taken this trump card away from steinmeier just weeks ahead of the elections .
what 's more is the fact that merkel demonstrated how good her relationship to president mevedev is while at the same time – as was clearly shown in the media – expressing her opinion about human rights in chechnya , which has clearly set her apart from steinmeier and his political foster father gerhard schroeder .
especially since the social democrats have always been criticized about their russia policies , which are seen as not critical enough when it comes to authoritarian tendencies and democratic deficits in russia .
the visit to sochi was a real political feat for merkel .
she reinforced a good political relationship with russia and made it clear she was supporting german jobs while at the same time taking the wind out of her opponent 's sails .
the fact that russian president medvedev willingly cooperated is n't only about the russian interest in opel .
even he must be aware of the polls in germany showing merkel in the lead and wants to be able to cash in on the good relations over the next four years .

but the group said friday the plan had not yet been finalized and would take a few more days to complete .
cengiz kapmaz , spokesman for the defense team for jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan , who has been incarcerated on imrali island since his 1999 conviction , confirmed that the roadmap would need more time .
" ocalan 's lawyers have not finished writing up his statements , " he said .
" the lawyers will return to the island on wednesday . "
the pkk plan , devised by ocalan , coincides with efforts by ankara to draw up kurdish-friendly policies in an attempt to win over the minority population and encourage the pkk to give up its armed struggle .
progress on the matter is considered integral to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
" by the end of the year we will begin with those measures of the kurdish initiative that can be implemented , " said turkish prime minister tayyip on friday .
although the turkish government has been urged to consider the ocalan plan , ankara has repeatedly refused to meet with officials from the pkk , which it , too , considers a terrorist organization .
the pkk is seeking autonomy for the kurdish minority in turkey , estimated at around 12 million people mainly in the east and southeast of the country .
according to estimates , the conflict has claimed as many as 45,000 lives. dfm / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but according to dw 's ingo manteufel , it was also part of merkel 's election campaign . how times have changed .
when german chancellor angela merkel met with russian president dmitry medvedev a year ago in sochi , the mood was icy .
the russia-georgia war had severely damaged relations between moscow and berlin .
but even though differences concerning georgia and russia 's conduct in the caucuses continue to exist , thanks to the global financial and economic crisis , the situation has visibly changed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel now both sides have called a truce and want to start rebuilding a strategic partnership .
the goal is to cooperate closely on several projects – saving the german auto company opel , helping preserve the waden yards collection of ship yards , and ensuring the continued existence of chip maker infinion .
but the declaration of intent for better german-russo economic cooperation was n't the surprising outcome of merkel 's visit to sochi .
germany and russia announced months ago that they planned to get through the economic crisis by working more together .
that fact was most recently made evident during a meeting between merkel and mevedev in munich one month ago .
inter-political chess match more interesting was the fact that merkel was able to use the trip to sochi to one-up her current vice chancellor and opponent for the chancellery , frank-walter steinmeier .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- may be in the lead six weeks ahead of federal elections in germany , but they have n't won yet , and every foreign trip is like a mini election campaign .
that 's even more true when it comes to visits with russian presidents .
ever since the male bonding that took place between gerhard schroeder and vladimir putin , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have tried to keep everything that has to do with russia in german politics all to themselves – even more so when it comes to frank-walter steinmeier .
over the past few years he has been a frequent and welcome guest at the kremlin , even during times of crisis .
under his leadership as foreign minister , the foreign ministry developed and propagated the concept of a german-russo modernization partnership , which is focused on linking the german and russian economies .
good relationships despite criticism with this trip to sochi focused on partnerships and cooperation merkel has taken this trump card away from steinmeier just weeks ahead of the elections .
what 's more is the fact that merkel demonstrated how good her relationship to president mevedev is while at the same time – as was clearly shown in the media – expressing her opinion about human rights in chechnya , which has clearly set her apart from steinmeier and his political foster father gerhard schroeder .
especially since the social democrats have always been criticized about their russia policies , which are seen as not critical enough when it comes to authoritarian tendencies and democratic deficits in russia .
the visit to sochi was a real political feat for merkel .
she reinforced a good political relationship with russia and made it clear she was supporting german jobs while at the same time taking the wind out of her opponent 's sails .
the fact that russian president medvedev willingly cooperated is n't only about the russian interest in opel .
even he must be aware of the polls in germany showing merkel in the lead and wants to be able to cash in on the good relations over the next four years .

rivals bayern munich meanwhile had to settle for a draw at home to werder bremen . fabrice ehret gave cologne the lead four minutes into the second interval , but edin dzeko equalized for wolfsburg on 74 minutes .
wolfsburg then grabbed the lead when pierre wome netted in his own goal a minute later .
substitute obafemi martins made it 3-1 with three minutes remaining , all but destroying hopes of a late cologne comeback .
in munich , young german international midfielder mesut ozil gave bremen the lead but mario gomez brought bayern back into the contest with a goal midway through the second half .
the results see wolfsburg move to six points from two games , two clear of eintracht frankfurt and sv hamburg , who demolished borussia dortmund 4-1 .
bayern languish in 10th spot , four points off the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ozil was bremen 's lone scorer away from home attacking soccer the clash between hamburg and dortmund promised fireworks and after a frantic first 12 minutes the match seemed to be heading in that direction .
hamburg 's guy demel tapped in after just three minutes to put the home side ahead , but dortmund leveled just two minutes later through nelson valdez .
that goal was soon nullified however by quick strikes from new purchase ze roberto and jose paolo guerrero .
substitute marcus berg was on the pitch just three minutes when he scored a fourth goal for hamburg to give bruno labbadia 's men an unassailable three goal buffer .

pogrebnyak was also involved in stuttgart 's second on 65 minutes when the striker was judged to have been fouled in the area by freiburg goalkeeper manuel salz .
substitute elson slotted home the resultant spot-kick .
mohamadou idrissou gave freiburg hope with a header but elson responded almost immediately with a superb strike from outside the area 14 minutes from time to make it 3-1 .
there was still time for idrissou to reduce the deficit once again but julian shieber made it 4-2 a minute from time to ensure markus babbel 's side all three points .
the win was overshadowed by the news that stuttgart midfielder martin lanig will be out of action until the new year after sustaining cruciate ligament damage .

the rest , as they say , is history . it was june , 1969 , and 24-year-old cologne native dieter frowein-lyasso had just finished his military service with the german army .
american soldiers stationed in the area told him about a big music festival happening in woodstock , near new york .
and he knew immediately - he had to go .
" i remember thinking that i had to get away from all the uniforms , the command structures , the obedience of the military , and that the best way to do that would be to mingle with people from a completely different world , " says frowein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein was looking for a release following military service the music lover promptly booked himself on a flight to new york .
he kept his plans secret , as he was determined to travel alone .
he used the money he got from the army as compensation for completing his military service to pay for the flight .
after arriving in new york , frowein found accommodation in a youth hostel , where he met a group of young people from the midwest who were also going to the festival .
" they simply took me along , because they thought it was so unusual that someone had come all the way from germany , " frowein says .
the only problem was , no one knew the way .
and when they finally did arrive in woodstock , they had a surprise waiting for them .
" woodstock ?
not here ! "
frowein remembers .
" instead , it was all taking place in the next town , which was bethel .
the people of woodstock did n't want to host it after all , so the organizers moved it the whole show to bethel , which is about three kilometers from woodstock . "
sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso says he stood out from the hippies frowein could n't speak much english , and his clothes were also very different from the styles worn by the " hippies " who had descended on the venue .
although he was dressed " normally , " he recalls feeling at home in the exotic surroundings .
" i was n't shy , and so i was able to really enjoy myself , " he says .
" i wandered around and looked at the people .
everyone said ' hello ' or ' hi ' and that was it .
i just soaked up this incredible atmosphere . "
he did n't have much to eat or drink during the festival , and the continuous downpour was a nuisance , because while others had tents and camping equipment with them , frowein had nothing but his rain slicker .
he also did n't know quite what to make of the rampant drug use or the concept of free love .
" of course some people were running around in the nude , but that did n't really interest me , " he says .
" i was there to hear the music and to mingle with these people and see how they lived .
sex and drugs were part of it , but that did n't bother me . "
one of the main topics of conversation was the moon landing , which happened shortly before woodstock .
but for frowein , it was of little significance , being " too military " for his liking .
all that mattered was being able to experience first-hand the music greats of the day .
" when janis joplin died of an overdose not long after the festival , at least i was able to say that i had seen her perform live - that was very important for me , " he remembers .
cherished memories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso treasures the experience of woodstock after three days , frowein hit the road .
he hitchhiked back to new york and boarded a plane to germany .
back home , he saw how woodstock had become a huge media event , and how the music featured there was being played in all the bars and clubs .
he does n't often tell people that he was there - they would n't believe him anyway , he says .
today , dieter frowein manages an art supply shop in cologne .
in 1996 , he revisited the festival grounds in bethel , and took photos of the site .
but the real memories of those three crazy days full of music and colorful people in 1969 are firmly anchored in his mind .
" one thing 's for certain , " he says .
" the whole experience sure helped to blow off the stodginess of my time with the german army ! "

the attack comes just days before afghanistan 's national elections . the suicide car bomb was detonated near the gate of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- office in the wazir akbar khan district , where most of the major foreign embassies and organizations are located in afghanistan 's capital .
" unfortunately , there are casualties , " said canadian brigadier general eric tremblay , an isaf spokesman .
" there are afghan civilians and there are isaf military . "
taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid confirmed that the taliban was behind the bombing .
" it was carried out by one of our hero mujahid , ahmad , and the target was the us embassy and nato headquarters , " mujahid said in a telephone interview with the german news agency dpa .
the blast blew out windows and rattled building in the neighborhood and a large cloud of smoke rose from the site of the attack over kabul .
it also rattled the confidence of a nation preparing for only its second ever direct presidential election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the us have increased troop levels security in kabul and across the country has been tightened in advance of the august 20 polls , with 30,000 extra american troops in place .
security forces have increased their patrols and set up new checkpoints in kabul .
worries for election day but many observers and afghan civilians fear that the country is still not secure enough for an election .
despite the relative calm over the last several months , the taliban has conducted over 20 attacks against politicians taking part in the elections .
incumbent president hamid karzai 's running mate mohammad qasim fahin was attacked by militants in northern afghanistan and one cameraman was wounded .
two workers of karzai 's main challenger , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , were killed by gunmen .
" the government says it will install the polling stations in secure areas like the center of the district , but how can we go there from our village ? " asked rahim jan kako from the zherai district in southern afghanistan .
" i voted last time despite threats , but what the election brought us was killing and destruction . "
independent election commission officials said this week that elections would not be able to be held in 10 districts unless those areas were secured .
a mass abstention from the vote is currently being predicted by analysts .
such a low turnout could lead the new government to lack legitimacy in the eyes of the afghan people. hf / dpa / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the attack comes just days before afghanistan 's national elections . the suicide car bomb was detonated near the gate of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- office in the wazir akbar khan district , where most of the major foreign embassies and organizations are located in afghanistan 's capital .
" unfortunately , there are casualties , " said canadian brigadier general eric tremblay , an isaf spokesman .
" there are afghan civilians and there are isaf military . "
taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid confirmed that the taliban was behind the bombing .
" it was carried out by one of our hero mujahid , ahmad , and the target was the us embassy and nato headquarters , " mujahid said in a telephone interview with the german news agency dpa .
the blast blew out windows and rattled building in the neighborhood and a large cloud of smoke rose from the site of the attack over kabul .
it also rattled the confidence of a nation preparing for only its second ever direct presidential election .

worries for election day but many observers and afghan civilians fear that the country is still not secure enough for an election .
despite the relative calm over the last several months , the taliban has conducted over 20 attacks against politicians taking part in the elections .
incumbent president hamid karzai 's running mate mohammad qasim fahin was attacked by militants in northern afghanistan and one cameraman was wounded .
two workers of karzai 's main challenger , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , were killed by gunmen .
" the government says it will install the polling stations in secure areas like the center of the district , but how can we go there from our village ? " asked rahim jan kako from the zherai district in southern afghanistan .
" i voted last time despite threats , but what the election brought us was killing and destruction . "
independent election commission officials said this week that elections would not be able to be held in 10 districts unless those areas were secured .
a mass abstention from the vote is currently being predicted by analysts .
such a low turnout could lead the new government to lack legitimacy in the eyes of the afghan people. hf / dpa / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the attack comes just days before afghanistan 's national elections . the suicide car bomb was detonated near the gate of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- office in the wazir akbar khan district , where most of the major foreign embassies and organizations are located in afghanistan 's capital .
" unfortunately , there are casualties , " said canadian brigadier general eric tremblay , an isaf spokesman .
" there are afghan civilians and there are isaf military . "
taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid confirmed that the taliban was behind the bombing .
" it was carried out by one of our hero mujahid , ahmad , and the target was the us embassy and nato headquarters , " mujahid said in a telephone interview with the german news agency dpa .
the blast blew out windows and rattled building in the neighborhood and a large cloud of smoke rose from the site of the attack over kabul .
it also rattled the confidence of a nation preparing for only its second ever direct presidential election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the us have increased troop levels security in kabul and across the country has been tightened in advance of the august 20 polls , with 30,000 extra american troops in place .
security forces have increased their patrols and set up new checkpoints in kabul .
worries for election day but many observers and afghan civilians fear that the country is still not secure enough for an election .

the rest , as they say , is history . it was june , 1969 , and 24-year-old cologne native dieter frowein-lyasso had just finished his military service with the german army .
american soldiers stationed in the area told him about a big music festival happening in woodstock , near new york .
and he knew immediately - he had to go .
" i remember thinking that i had to get away from all the uniforms , the command structures , the obedience of the military , and that the best way to do that would be to mingle with people from a completely different world , " says frowein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein was looking for a release following military service the music lover promptly booked himself on a flight to new york .
he kept his plans secret , as he was determined to travel alone .
he used the money he got from the army as compensation for completing his military service to pay for the flight .
after arriving in new york , frowein found accommodation in a youth hostel , where he met a group of young people from the midwest who were also going to the festival .
" they simply took me along , because they thought it was so unusual that someone had come all the way from germany , " frowein says .
the only problem was , no one knew the way .
and when they finally did arrive in woodstock , they had a surprise waiting for them .
" woodstock ?
not here ! "
frowein remembers .
" instead , it was all taking place in the next town , which was bethel .
the people of woodstock did n't want to host it after all , so the organizers moved it the whole show to bethel , which is about three kilometers from woodstock . "
sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso says he stood out from the hippies frowein could n't speak much english , and his clothes were also very different from the styles worn by the " hippies " who had descended on the venue .
although he was dressed " normally , " he recalls feeling at home in the exotic surroundings .
" i was n't shy , and so i was able to really enjoy myself , " he says .
" i wandered around and looked at the people .
everyone said ' hello ' or ' hi ' and that was it .
i just soaked up this incredible atmosphere . "
he did n't have much to eat or drink during the festival , and the continuous downpour was a nuisance , because while others had tents and camping equipment with them , frowein had nothing but his rain slicker .
he also did n't know quite what to make of the rampant drug use or the concept of free love .
" of course some people were running around in the nude , but that did n't really interest me , " he says .
" i was there to hear the music and to mingle with these people and see how they lived .
sex and drugs were part of it , but that did n't bother me . "
one of the main topics of conversation was the moon landing , which happened shortly before woodstock .
but for frowein , it was of little significance , being " too military " for his liking .
all that mattered was being able to experience first-hand the music greats of the day .
" when janis joplin died of an overdose not long after the festival , at least i was able to say that i had seen her perform live - that was very important for me , " he remembers .
cherished memories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso treasures the experience of woodstock after three days , frowein hit the road .
he hitchhiked back to new york and boarded a plane to germany .
back home , he saw how woodstock had become a huge media event , and how the music featured there was being played in all the bars and clubs .
he does n't often tell people that he was there - they would n't believe him anyway , he says .
today , dieter frowein manages an art supply shop in cologne .
in 1996 , he revisited the festival grounds in bethel , and took photos of the site .
but the real memories of those three crazy days full of music and colorful people in 1969 are firmly anchored in his mind .
" one thing 's for certain , " he says .
" the whole experience sure helped to blow off the stodginess of my time with the german army ! "

the rest , as they say , is history . it was june , 1969 , and 24-year-old cologne native dieter frowein-lyasso had just finished his military service with the german army .
american soldiers stationed in the area told him about a big music festival happening in woodstock , near new york .
and he knew immediately - he had to go .
" i remember thinking that i had to get away from all the uniforms , the command structures , the obedience of the military , and that the best way to do that would be to mingle with people from a completely different world , " says frowein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein was looking for a release following military service the music lover promptly booked himself on a flight to new york .
he kept his plans secret , as he was determined to travel alone .
he used the money he got from the army as compensation for completing his military service to pay for the flight .
after arriving in new york , frowein found accommodation in a youth hostel , where he met a group of young people from the midwest who were also going to the festival .
" they simply took me along , because they thought it was so unusual that someone had come all the way from germany , " frowein says .
the only problem was , no one knew the way .
and when they finally did arrive in woodstock , they had a surprise waiting for them .
" woodstock ?
not here ! "
frowein remembers .
" instead , it was all taking place in the next town , which was bethel .
the people of woodstock did n't want to host it after all , so the organizers moved it the whole show to bethel , which is about three kilometers from woodstock . "
sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso says he stood out from the hippies frowein could n't speak much english , and his clothes were also very different from the styles worn by the " hippies " who had descended on the venue .
although he was dressed " normally , " he recalls feeling at home in the exotic surroundings .
" i was n't shy , and so i was able to really enjoy myself , " he says .
" i wandered around and looked at the people .
everyone said ' hello ' or ' hi ' and that was it .
i just soaked up this incredible atmosphere . "
he did n't have much to eat or drink during the festival , and the continuous downpour was a nuisance , because while others had tents and camping equipment with them , frowein had nothing but his rain slicker .
he also did n't know quite what to make of the rampant drug use or the concept of free love .
" of course some people were running around in the nude , but that did n't really interest me , " he says .
" i was there to hear the music and to mingle with these people and see how they lived .
sex and drugs were part of it , but that did n't bother me . "
one of the main topics of conversation was the moon landing , which happened shortly before woodstock .
but for frowein , it was of little significance , being " too military " for his liking .
all that mattered was being able to experience first-hand the music greats of the day .
" when janis joplin died of an overdose not long after the festival , at least i was able to say that i had seen her perform live - that was very important for me , " he remembers .
cherished memories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso treasures the experience of woodstock after three days , frowein hit the road .
he hitchhiked back to new york and boarded a plane to germany .
back home , he saw how woodstock had become a huge media event , and how the music featured there was being played in all the bars and clubs .
he does n't often tell people that he was there - they would n't believe him anyway , he says .
today , dieter frowein manages an art supply shop in cologne .
in 1996 , he revisited the festival grounds in bethel , and took photos of the site .
but the real memories of those three crazy days full of music and colorful people in 1969 are firmly anchored in his mind .
" one thing 's for certain , " he says .
" the whole experience sure helped to blow off the stodginess of my time with the german army ! "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.08.2009 opinion : merkel 's trip to sotchi about more than relations with russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting between rusian president dmitry medvedev and german chancellor angela merkel in sochi was heavy on german-russo relations .
but according to dw 's ingo manteufel , it was also part of merkel 's election campaign . how times have changed .
when german chancellor angela merkel met with russian president dmitry medvedev a year ago in sochi , the mood was icy .
the russia-georgia war had severely damaged relations between moscow and berlin .
but even though differences concerning georgia and russia 's conduct in the caucuses continue to exist , thanks to the global financial and economic crisis , the situation has visibly changed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel now both sides have called a truce and want to start rebuilding a strategic partnership .
the goal is to cooperate closely on several projects – saving the german auto company opel , helping preserve the waden yards collection of ship yards , and ensuring the continued existence of chip maker infinion .
but the declaration of intent for better german-russo economic cooperation was n't the surprising outcome of merkel 's visit to sochi .
germany and russia announced months ago that they planned to get through the economic crisis by working more together .
that fact was most recently made evident during a meeting between merkel and mevedev in munich one month ago .
inter-political chess match more interesting was the fact that merkel was able to use the trip to sochi to one-up her current vice chancellor and opponent for the chancellery , frank-walter steinmeier .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- may be in the lead six weeks ahead of federal elections in germany , but they have n't won yet , and every foreign trip is like a mini election campaign .
that 's even more true when it comes to visits with russian presidents .
ever since the male bonding that took place between gerhard schroeder and vladimir putin , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have tried to keep everything that has to do with russia in german politics all to themselves – even more so when it comes to frank-walter steinmeier .
over the past few years he has been a frequent and welcome guest at the kremlin , even during times of crisis .
under his leadership as foreign minister , the foreign ministry developed and propagated the concept of a german-russo modernization partnership , which is focused on linking the german and russian economies .
good relationships despite criticism with this trip to sochi focused on partnerships and cooperation merkel has taken this trump card away from steinmeier just weeks ahead of the elections .
what 's more is the fact that merkel demonstrated how good her relationship to president mevedev is while at the same time – as was clearly shown in the media – expressing her opinion about human rights in chechnya , which has clearly set her apart from steinmeier and his political foster father gerhard schroeder .
especially since the social democrats have always been criticized about their russia policies , which are seen as not critical enough when it comes to authoritarian tendencies and democratic deficits in russia .
the visit to sochi was a real political feat for merkel .
she reinforced a good political relationship with russia and made it clear she was supporting german jobs while at the same time taking the wind out of her opponent 's sails .
the fact that russian president medvedev willingly cooperated is n't only about the russian interest in opel .
even he must be aware of the polls in germany showing merkel in the lead and wants to be able to cash in on the good relations over the next four years .

the rest , as they say , is history . it was june , 1969 , and 24-year-old cologne native dieter frowein-lyasso had just finished his military service with the german army .
american soldiers stationed in the area told him about a big music festival happening in woodstock , near new york .
and he knew immediately - he had to go .
" i remember thinking that i had to get away from all the uniforms , the command structures , the obedience of the military , and that the best way to do that would be to mingle with people from a completely different world , " says frowein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein was looking for a release following military service the music lover promptly booked himself on a flight to new york .
he kept his plans secret , as he was determined to travel alone .
he used the money he got from the army as compensation for completing his military service to pay for the flight .
after arriving in new york , frowein found accommodation in a youth hostel , where he met a group of young people from the midwest who were also going to the festival .
" they simply took me along , because they thought it was so unusual that someone had come all the way from germany , " frowein says .
the only problem was , no one knew the way .
and when they finally did arrive in woodstock , they had a surprise waiting for them .
" woodstock ?
not here ! "
frowein remembers .
" instead , it was all taking place in the next town , which was bethel .
the people of woodstock did n't want to host it after all , so the organizers moved it the whole show to bethel , which is about three kilometers from woodstock . "
sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso says he stood out from the hippies frowein could n't speak much english , and his clothes were also very different from the styles worn by the " hippies " who had descended on the venue .
although he was dressed " normally , " he recalls feeling at home in the exotic surroundings .
" i was n't shy , and so i was able to really enjoy myself , " he says .
" i wandered around and looked at the people .
everyone said ' hello ' or ' hi ' and that was it .
i just soaked up this incredible atmosphere . "
he did n't have much to eat or drink during the festival , and the continuous downpour was a nuisance , because while others had tents and camping equipment with them , frowein had nothing but his rain slicker .
he also did n't know quite what to make of the rampant drug use or the concept of free love .
" of course some people were running around in the nude , but that did n't really interest me , " he says .
" i was there to hear the music and to mingle with these people and see how they lived .
sex and drugs were part of it , but that did n't bother me . "
one of the main topics of conversation was the moon landing , which happened shortly before woodstock .
but for frowein , it was of little significance , being " too military " for his liking .
all that mattered was being able to experience first-hand the music greats of the day .
" when janis joplin died of an overdose not long after the festival , at least i was able to say that i had seen her perform live - that was very important for me , " he remembers .
cherished memories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso treasures the experience of woodstock after three days , frowein hit the road .
he hitchhiked back to new york and boarded a plane to germany .
back home , he saw how woodstock had become a huge media event , and how the music featured there was being played in all the bars and clubs .
he does n't often tell people that he was there - they would n't believe him anyway , he says .
today , dieter frowein manages an art supply shop in cologne .
in 1996 , he revisited the festival grounds in bethel , and took photos of the site .
but the real memories of those three crazy days full of music and colorful people in 1969 are firmly anchored in his mind .
" one thing 's for certain , " he says .
" the whole experience sure helped to blow off the stodginess of my time with the german army ! "

but the group said friday the plan had not yet been finalized and would take a few more days to complete .
cengiz kapmaz , spokesman for the defense team for jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan , who has been incarcerated on imrali island since his 1999 conviction , confirmed that the roadmap would need more time .
" ocalan 's lawyers have not finished writing up his statements , " he said .
" the lawyers will return to the island on wednesday . "
the pkk plan , devised by ocalan , coincides with efforts by ankara to draw up kurdish-friendly policies in an attempt to win over the minority population and encourage the pkk to give up its armed struggle .
progress on the matter is considered integral to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
" by the end of the year we will begin with those measures of the kurdish initiative that can be implemented , " said turkish prime minister tayyip on friday .
although the turkish government has been urged to consider the ocalan plan , ankara has repeatedly refused to meet with officials from the pkk , which it , too , considers a terrorist organization .
the pkk is seeking autonomy for the kurdish minority in turkey , estimated at around 12 million people mainly in the east and southeast of the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.08.2009 opinion : merkel 's trip to sotchi about more than relations with russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting between rusian president dmitry medvedev and german chancellor angela merkel in sochi was heavy on german-russo relations .
but according to dw 's ingo manteufel , it was also part of merkel 's election campaign . how times have changed .
when german chancellor angela merkel met with russian president dmitry medvedev a year ago in sochi , the mood was icy .
the russia-georgia war had severely damaged relations between moscow and berlin .
but even though differences concerning georgia and russia 's conduct in the caucuses continue to exist , thanks to the global financial and economic crisis , the situation has visibly changed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel now both sides have called a truce and want to start rebuilding a strategic partnership .
the goal is to cooperate closely on several projects – saving the german auto company opel , helping preserve the waden yards collection of ship yards , and ensuring the continued existence of chip maker infinion .
but the declaration of intent for better german-russo economic cooperation was n't the surprising outcome of merkel 's visit to sochi .
germany and russia announced months ago that they planned to get through the economic crisis by working more together .
that fact was most recently made evident during a meeting between merkel and mevedev in munich one month ago .
inter-political chess match more interesting was the fact that merkel was able to use the trip to sochi to one-up her current vice chancellor and opponent for the chancellery , frank-walter steinmeier .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- may be in the lead six weeks ahead of federal elections in germany , but they have n't won yet , and every foreign trip is like a mini election campaign .
that 's even more true when it comes to visits with russian presidents .
ever since the male bonding that took place between gerhard schroeder and vladimir putin , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have tried to keep everything that has to do with russia in german politics all to themselves – even more so when it comes to frank-walter steinmeier .
over the past few years he has been a frequent and welcome guest at the kremlin , even during times of crisis .
under his leadership as foreign minister , the foreign ministry developed and propagated the concept of a german-russo modernization partnership , which is focused on linking the german and russian economies .
good relationships despite criticism with this trip to sochi focused on partnerships and cooperation merkel has taken this trump card away from steinmeier just weeks ahead of the elections .
what 's more is the fact that merkel demonstrated how good her relationship to president mevedev is while at the same time – as was clearly shown in the media – expressing her opinion about human rights in chechnya , which has clearly set her apart from steinmeier and his political foster father gerhard schroeder .
especially since the social democrats have always been criticized about their russia policies , which are seen as not critical enough when it comes to authoritarian tendencies and democratic deficits in russia .
the visit to sochi was a real political feat for merkel .
she reinforced a good political relationship with russia and made it clear she was supporting german jobs while at the same time taking the wind out of her opponent 's sails .

but according to dw 's ingo manteufel , it was also part of merkel 's election campaign . how times have changed .
when german chancellor angela merkel met with russian president dmitry medvedev a year ago in sochi , the mood was icy .
the russia-georgia war had severely damaged relations between moscow and berlin .
but even though differences concerning georgia and russia 's conduct in the caucuses continue to exist , thanks to the global financial and economic crisis , the situation has visibly changed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel now both sides have called a truce and want to start rebuilding a strategic partnership .
the goal is to cooperate closely on several projects – saving the german auto company opel , helping preserve the waden yards collection of ship yards , and ensuring the continued existence of chip maker infinion .
but the declaration of intent for better german-russo economic cooperation was n't the surprising outcome of merkel 's visit to sochi .
germany and russia announced months ago that they planned to get through the economic crisis by working more together .
that fact was most recently made evident during a meeting between merkel and mevedev in munich one month ago .
inter-political chess match more interesting was the fact that merkel was able to use the trip to sochi to one-up her current vice chancellor and opponent for the chancellery , frank-walter steinmeier .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- may be in the lead six weeks ahead of federal elections in germany , but they have n't won yet , and every foreign trip is like a mini election campaign .
that 's even more true when it comes to visits with russian presidents .
ever since the male bonding that took place between gerhard schroeder and vladimir putin , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have tried to keep everything that has to do with russia in german politics all to themselves – even more so when it comes to frank-walter steinmeier .
over the past few years he has been a frequent and welcome guest at the kremlin , even during times of crisis .
under his leadership as foreign minister , the foreign ministry developed and propagated the concept of a german-russo modernization partnership , which is focused on linking the german and russian economies .
good relationships despite criticism with this trip to sochi focused on partnerships and cooperation merkel has taken this trump card away from steinmeier just weeks ahead of the elections .
what 's more is the fact that merkel demonstrated how good her relationship to president mevedev is while at the same time – as was clearly shown in the media – expressing her opinion about human rights in chechnya , which has clearly set her apart from steinmeier and his political foster father gerhard schroeder .
especially since the social democrats have always been criticized about their russia policies , which are seen as not critical enough when it comes to authoritarian tendencies and democratic deficits in russia .
the visit to sochi was a real political feat for merkel .
she reinforced a good political relationship with russia and made it clear she was supporting german jobs while at the same time taking the wind out of her opponent 's sails .
the fact that russian president medvedev willingly cooperated is n't only about the russian interest in opel .
even he must be aware of the polls in germany showing merkel in the lead and wants to be able to cash in on the good relations over the next four years .

the rest , as they say , is history . it was june , 1969 , and 24-year-old cologne native dieter frowein-lyasso had just finished his military service with the german army .
american soldiers stationed in the area told him about a big music festival happening in woodstock , near new york .
and he knew immediately - he had to go .
" i remember thinking that i had to get away from all the uniforms , the command structures , the obedience of the military , and that the best way to do that would be to mingle with people from a completely different world , " says frowein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein was looking for a release following military service the music lover promptly booked himself on a flight to new york .
he kept his plans secret , as he was determined to travel alone .
he used the money he got from the army as compensation for completing his military service to pay for the flight .
after arriving in new york , frowein found accommodation in a youth hostel , where he met a group of young people from the midwest who were also going to the festival .
" they simply took me along , because they thought it was so unusual that someone had come all the way from germany , " frowein says .
the only problem was , no one knew the way .
and when they finally did arrive in woodstock , they had a surprise waiting for them .
" woodstock ?
not here ! "
frowein remembers .
" instead , it was all taking place in the next town , which was bethel .
the people of woodstock did n't want to host it after all , so the organizers moved it the whole show to bethel , which is about three kilometers from woodstock . "
sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso says he stood out from the hippies frowein could n't speak much english , and his clothes were also very different from the styles worn by the " hippies " who had descended on the venue .
although he was dressed " normally , " he recalls feeling at home in the exotic surroundings .
" i was n't shy , and so i was able to really enjoy myself , " he says .
" i wandered around and looked at the people .
everyone said ' hello ' or ' hi ' and that was it .
i just soaked up this incredible atmosphere . "
he did n't have much to eat or drink during the festival , and the continuous downpour was a nuisance , because while others had tents and camping equipment with them , frowein had nothing but his rain slicker .
he also did n't know quite what to make of the rampant drug use or the concept of free love .
" of course some people were running around in the nude , but that did n't really interest me , " he says .
" i was there to hear the music and to mingle with these people and see how they lived .
sex and drugs were part of it , but that did n't bother me . "
one of the main topics of conversation was the moon landing , which happened shortly before woodstock .
but for frowein , it was of little significance , being " too military " for his liking .
all that mattered was being able to experience first-hand the music greats of the day .
" when janis joplin died of an overdose not long after the festival , at least i was able to say that i had seen her perform live - that was very important for me , " he remembers .
cherished memories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso treasures the experience of woodstock after three days , frowein hit the road .
he hitchhiked back to new york and boarded a plane to germany .
back home , he saw how woodstock had become a huge media event , and how the music featured there was being played in all the bars and clubs .
he does n't often tell people that he was there - they would n't believe him anyway , he says .
today , dieter frowein manages an art supply shop in cologne .
in 1996 , he revisited the festival grounds in bethel , and took photos of the site .
but the real memories of those three crazy days full of music and colorful people in 1969 are firmly anchored in his mind .
" one thing 's for certain , " he says .
" the whole experience sure helped to blow off the stodginess of my time with the german army ! "

but the group said friday the plan had not yet been finalized and would take a few more days to complete .
cengiz kapmaz , spokesman for the defense team for jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan , who has been incarcerated on imrali island since his 1999 conviction , confirmed that the roadmap would need more time .
" ocalan 's lawyers have not finished writing up his statements , " he said .
" the lawyers will return to the island on wednesday . "
the pkk plan , devised by ocalan , coincides with efforts by ankara to draw up kurdish-friendly policies in an attempt to win over the minority population and encourage the pkk to give up its armed struggle .
progress on the matter is considered integral to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
" by the end of the year we will begin with those measures of the kurdish initiative that can be implemented , " said turkish prime minister tayyip on friday .
although the turkish government has been urged to consider the ocalan plan , ankara has repeatedly refused to meet with officials from the pkk , which it , too , considers a terrorist organization .
the pkk is seeking autonomy for the kurdish minority in turkey , estimated at around 12 million people mainly in the east and southeast of the country .
according to estimates , the conflict has claimed as many as 45,000 lives. dfm / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rest , as they say , is history . it was june , 1969 , and 24-year-old cologne native dieter frowein-lyasso had just finished his military service with the german army .
american soldiers stationed in the area told him about a big music festival happening in woodstock , near new york .
and he knew immediately - he had to go .
" i remember thinking that i had to get away from all the uniforms , the command structures , the obedience of the military , and that the best way to do that would be to mingle with people from a completely different world , " says frowein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein was looking for a release following military service the music lover promptly booked himself on a flight to new york .
he kept his plans secret , as he was determined to travel alone .
he used the money he got from the army as compensation for completing his military service to pay for the flight .
after arriving in new york , frowein found accommodation in a youth hostel , where he met a group of young people from the midwest who were also going to the festival .
" they simply took me along , because they thought it was so unusual that someone had come all the way from germany , " frowein says .
the only problem was , no one knew the way .
and when they finally did arrive in woodstock , they had a surprise waiting for them .
" woodstock ?
not here ! "
frowein remembers .
" instead , it was all taking place in the next town , which was bethel .
the people of woodstock did n't want to host it after all , so the organizers moved it the whole show to bethel , which is about three kilometers from woodstock . "
sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso says he stood out from the hippies frowein could n't speak much english , and his clothes were also very different from the styles worn by the " hippies " who had descended on the venue .
although he was dressed " normally , " he recalls feeling at home in the exotic surroundings .
" i was n't shy , and so i was able to really enjoy myself , " he says .
" i wandered around and looked at the people .
everyone said ' hello ' or ' hi ' and that was it .
i just soaked up this incredible atmosphere . "
he did n't have much to eat or drink during the festival , and the continuous downpour was a nuisance , because while others had tents and camping equipment with them , frowein had nothing but his rain slicker .
he also did n't know quite what to make of the rampant drug use or the concept of free love .
" of course some people were running around in the nude , but that did n't really interest me , " he says .
" i was there to hear the music and to mingle with these people and see how they lived .
sex and drugs were part of it , but that did n't bother me . "
one of the main topics of conversation was the moon landing , which happened shortly before woodstock .
but for frowein , it was of little significance , being " too military " for his liking .
all that mattered was being able to experience first-hand the music greats of the day .
" when janis joplin died of an overdose not long after the festival , at least i was able to say that i had seen her perform live - that was very important for me , " he remembers .
cherished memories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso treasures the experience of woodstock after three days , frowein hit the road .
he hitchhiked back to new york and boarded a plane to germany .
back home , he saw how woodstock had become a huge media event , and how the music featured there was being played in all the bars and clubs .
he does n't often tell people that he was there - they would n't believe him anyway , he says .
today , dieter frowein manages an art supply shop in cologne .
in 1996 , he revisited the festival grounds in bethel , and took photos of the site .
but the real memories of those three crazy days full of music and colorful people in 1969 are firmly anchored in his mind .
" one thing 's for certain , " he says .
" the whole experience sure helped to blow off the stodginess of my time with the german army ! "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.08.2009 opinion : merkel 's trip to sotchi about more than relations with russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting between rusian president dmitry medvedev and german chancellor angela merkel in sochi was heavy on german-russo relations .
but according to dw 's ingo manteufel , it was also part of merkel 's election campaign . how times have changed .
when german chancellor angela merkel met with russian president dmitry medvedev a year ago in sochi , the mood was icy .
the russia-georgia war had severely damaged relations between moscow and berlin .
but even though differences concerning georgia and russia 's conduct in the caucuses continue to exist , thanks to the global financial and economic crisis , the situation has visibly changed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel now both sides have called a truce and want to start rebuilding a strategic partnership .
the goal is to cooperate closely on several projects – saving the german auto company opel , helping preserve the waden yards collection of ship yards , and ensuring the continued existence of chip maker infinion .
but the declaration of intent for better german-russo economic cooperation was n't the surprising outcome of merkel 's visit to sochi .
germany and russia announced months ago that they planned to get through the economic crisis by working more together .
that fact was most recently made evident during a meeting between merkel and mevedev in munich one month ago .
inter-political chess match more interesting was the fact that merkel was able to use the trip to sochi to one-up her current vice chancellor and opponent for the chancellery , frank-walter steinmeier .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- may be in the lead six weeks ahead of federal elections in germany , but they have n't won yet , and every foreign trip is like a mini election campaign .
that 's even more true when it comes to visits with russian presidents .
ever since the male bonding that took place between gerhard schroeder and vladimir putin , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have tried to keep everything that has to do with russia in german politics all to themselves – even more so when it comes to frank-walter steinmeier .
over the past few years he has been a frequent and welcome guest at the kremlin , even during times of crisis .
under his leadership as foreign minister , the foreign ministry developed and propagated the concept of a german-russo modernization partnership , which is focused on linking the german and russian economies .
good relationships despite criticism with this trip to sochi focused on partnerships and cooperation merkel has taken this trump card away from steinmeier just weeks ahead of the elections .
what 's more is the fact that merkel demonstrated how good her relationship to president mevedev is while at the same time – as was clearly shown in the media – expressing her opinion about human rights in chechnya , which has clearly set her apart from steinmeier and his political foster father gerhard schroeder .
especially since the social democrats have always been criticized about their russia policies , which are seen as not critical enough when it comes to authoritarian tendencies and democratic deficits in russia .
the visit to sochi was a real political feat for merkel .
she reinforced a good political relationship with russia and made it clear she was supporting german jobs while at the same time taking the wind out of her opponent 's sails .
the fact that russian president medvedev willingly cooperated is n't only about the russian interest in opel .
even he must be aware of the polls in germany showing merkel in the lead and wants to be able to cash in on the good relations over the next four years .

but according to dw 's ingo manteufel , it was also part of merkel 's election campaign . how times have changed .
when german chancellor angela merkel met with russian president dmitry medvedev a year ago in sochi , the mood was icy .
the russia-georgia war had severely damaged relations between moscow and berlin .
but even though differences concerning georgia and russia 's conduct in the caucuses continue to exist , thanks to the global financial and economic crisis , the situation has visibly changed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel now both sides have called a truce and want to start rebuilding a strategic partnership .
the goal is to cooperate closely on several projects – saving the german auto company opel , helping preserve the waden yards collection of ship yards , and ensuring the continued existence of chip maker infinion .
but the declaration of intent for better german-russo economic cooperation was n't the surprising outcome of merkel 's visit to sochi .
germany and russia announced months ago that they planned to get through the economic crisis by working more together .
that fact was most recently made evident during a meeting between merkel and mevedev in munich one month ago .
inter-political chess match more interesting was the fact that merkel was able to use the trip to sochi to one-up her current vice chancellor and opponent for the chancellery , frank-walter steinmeier .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- may be in the lead six weeks ahead of federal elections in germany , but they have n't won yet , and every foreign trip is like a mini election campaign .
that 's even more true when it comes to visits with russian presidents .
ever since the male bonding that took place between gerhard schroeder and vladimir putin , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have tried to keep everything that has to do with russia in german politics all to themselves – even more so when it comes to frank-walter steinmeier .
over the past few years he has been a frequent and welcome guest at the kremlin , even during times of crisis .
under his leadership as foreign minister , the foreign ministry developed and propagated the concept of a german-russo modernization partnership , which is focused on linking the german and russian economies .
good relationships despite criticism with this trip to sochi focused on partnerships and cooperation merkel has taken this trump card away from steinmeier just weeks ahead of the elections .
what 's more is the fact that merkel demonstrated how good her relationship to president mevedev is while at the same time – as was clearly shown in the media – expressing her opinion about human rights in chechnya , which has clearly set her apart from steinmeier and his political foster father gerhard schroeder .
especially since the social democrats have always been criticized about their russia policies , which are seen as not critical enough when it comes to authoritarian tendencies and democratic deficits in russia .
the visit to sochi was a real political feat for merkel .
she reinforced a good political relationship with russia and made it clear she was supporting german jobs while at the same time taking the wind out of her opponent 's sails .
the fact that russian president medvedev willingly cooperated is n't only about the russian interest in opel .
even he must be aware of the polls in germany showing merkel in the lead and wants to be able to cash in on the good relations over the next four years .

but the group said friday the plan had not yet been finalized and would take a few more days to complete .
cengiz kapmaz , spokesman for the defense team for jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan , who has been incarcerated on imrali island since his 1999 conviction , confirmed that the roadmap would need more time .
" ocalan 's lawyers have not finished writing up his statements , " he said .
" the lawyers will return to the island on wednesday . "
the pkk plan , devised by ocalan , coincides with efforts by ankara to draw up kurdish-friendly policies in an attempt to win over the minority population and encourage the pkk to give up its armed struggle .
progress on the matter is considered integral to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
" by the end of the year we will begin with those measures of the kurdish initiative that can be implemented , " said turkish prime minister tayyip on friday .
although the turkish government has been urged to consider the ocalan plan , ankara has repeatedly refused to meet with officials from the pkk , which it , too , considers a terrorist organization .
the pkk is seeking autonomy for the kurdish minority in turkey , estimated at around 12 million people mainly in the east and southeast of the country .
according to estimates , the conflict has claimed as many as 45,000 lives. dfm / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when german chancellor angela merkel met with russian president dmitry medvedev a year ago in sochi , the mood was icy .
the russia-georgia war had severely damaged relations between moscow and berlin .
but even though differences concerning georgia and russia 's conduct in the caucuses continue to exist , thanks to the global financial and economic crisis , the situation has visibly changed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel now both sides have called a truce and want to start rebuilding a strategic partnership .
the goal is to cooperate closely on several projects – saving the german auto company opel , helping preserve the waden yards collection of ship yards , and ensuring the continued existence of chip maker infinion .
but the declaration of intent for better german-russo economic cooperation was n't the surprising outcome of merkel 's visit to sochi .
germany and russia announced months ago that they planned to get through the economic crisis by working more together .
that fact was most recently made evident during a meeting between merkel and mevedev in munich one month ago .
inter-political chess match more interesting was the fact that merkel was able to use the trip to sochi to one-up her current vice chancellor and opponent for the chancellery , frank-walter steinmeier .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- may be in the lead six weeks ahead of federal elections in germany , but they have n't won yet , and every foreign trip is like a mini election campaign .
that 's even more true when it comes to visits with russian presidents .
ever since the male bonding that took place between gerhard schroeder and vladimir putin , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have tried to keep everything that has to do with russia in german politics all to themselves – even more so when it comes to frank-walter steinmeier .
over the past few years he has been a frequent and welcome guest at the kremlin , even during times of crisis .
under his leadership as foreign minister , the foreign ministry developed and propagated the concept of a german-russo modernization partnership , which is focused on linking the german and russian economies .
good relationships despite criticism with this trip to sochi focused on partnerships and cooperation merkel has taken this trump card away from steinmeier just weeks ahead of the elections .
what 's more is the fact that merkel demonstrated how good her relationship to president mevedev is while at the same time – as was clearly shown in the media – expressing her opinion about human rights in chechnya , which has clearly set her apart from steinmeier and his political foster father gerhard schroeder .
especially since the social democrats have always been criticized about their russia policies , which are seen as not critical enough when it comes to authoritarian tendencies and democratic deficits in russia .
the visit to sochi was a real political feat for merkel .
she reinforced a good political relationship with russia and made it clear she was supporting german jobs while at the same time taking the wind out of her opponent 's sails .
the fact that russian president medvedev willingly cooperated is n't only about the russian interest in opel .
even he must be aware of the polls in germany showing merkel in the lead and wants to be able to cash in on the good relations over the next four years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 15.08.2009 remembering woodstock , 40 years on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso experienced the hedonism first-hand forty years ago , dieter frowein-lyasso was an ex-army recruit looking for a way to blow off some steam when he heard about a music festival taking place in a town called woodstock .
the rest , as they say , is history . it was june , 1969 , and 24-year-old cologne native dieter frowein-lyasso had just finished his military service with the german army .
american soldiers stationed in the area told him about a big music festival happening in woodstock , near new york .
and he knew immediately - he had to go .
" i remember thinking that i had to get away from all the uniforms , the command structures , the obedience of the military , and that the best way to do that would be to mingle with people from a completely different world , " says frowein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein was looking for a release following military service the music lover promptly booked himself on a flight to new york .
he kept his plans secret , as he was determined to travel alone .
he used the money he got from the army as compensation for completing his military service to pay for the flight .
after arriving in new york , frowein found accommodation in a youth hostel , where he met a group of young people from the midwest who were also going to the festival .
" they simply took me along , because they thought it was so unusual that someone had come all the way from germany , " frowein says .
the only problem was , no one knew the way .
and when they finally did arrive in woodstock , they had a surprise waiting for them .
" woodstock ?
not here ! "
frowein remembers .
" instead , it was all taking place in the next town , which was bethel .
the people of woodstock did n't want to host it after all , so the organizers moved it the whole show to bethel , which is about three kilometers from woodstock . "
sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso says he stood out from the hippies frowein could n't speak much english , and his clothes were also very different from the styles worn by the " hippies " who had descended on the venue .
although he was dressed " normally , " he recalls feeling at home in the exotic surroundings .
" i was n't shy , and so i was able to really enjoy myself , " he says .
" i wandered around and looked at the people .
everyone said ' hello ' or ' hi ' and that was it .
i just soaked up this incredible atmosphere . "
he did n't have much to eat or drink during the festival , and the continuous downpour was a nuisance , because while others had tents and camping equipment with them , frowein had nothing but his rain slicker .
he also did n't know quite what to make of the rampant drug use or the concept of free love .
" of course some people were running around in the nude , but that did n't really interest me , " he says .
" i was there to hear the music and to mingle with these people and see how they lived .
sex and drugs were part of it , but that did n't bother me . "
one of the main topics of conversation was the moon landing , which happened shortly before woodstock .
but for frowein , it was of little significance , being " too military " for his liking .
all that mattered was being able to experience first-hand the music greats of the day .
" when janis joplin died of an overdose not long after the festival , at least i was able to say that i had seen her perform live - that was very important for me , " he remembers .
cherished memories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso treasures the experience of woodstock after three days , frowein hit the road .
he hitchhiked back to new york and boarded a plane to germany .
back home , he saw how woodstock had become a huge media event , and how the music featured there was being played in all the bars and clubs .
he does n't often tell people that he was there - they would n't believe him anyway , he says .
today , dieter frowein manages an art supply shop in cologne .
in 1996 , he revisited the festival grounds in bethel , and took photos of the site .
but the real memories of those three crazy days full of music and colorful people in 1969 are firmly anchored in his mind .

the rest , as they say , is history . it was june , 1969 , and 24-year-old cologne native dieter frowein-lyasso had just finished his military service with the german army .
american soldiers stationed in the area told him about a big music festival happening in woodstock , near new york .
and he knew immediately - he had to go .
" i remember thinking that i had to get away from all the uniforms , the command structures , the obedience of the military , and that the best way to do that would be to mingle with people from a completely different world , " says frowein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein was looking for a release following military service the music lover promptly booked himself on a flight to new york .
he kept his plans secret , as he was determined to travel alone .
he used the money he got from the army as compensation for completing his military service to pay for the flight .
after arriving in new york , frowein found accommodation in a youth hostel , where he met a group of young people from the midwest who were also going to the festival .
" they simply took me along , because they thought it was so unusual that someone had come all the way from germany , " frowein says .
the only problem was , no one knew the way .
and when they finally did arrive in woodstock , they had a surprise waiting for them .
" woodstock ?
not here ! "
frowein remembers .
" instead , it was all taking place in the next town , which was bethel .
the people of woodstock did n't want to host it after all , so the organizers moved it the whole show to bethel , which is about three kilometers from woodstock . "
sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso says he stood out from the hippies frowein could n't speak much english , and his clothes were also very different from the styles worn by the " hippies " who had descended on the venue .
although he was dressed " normally , " he recalls feeling at home in the exotic surroundings .
" i was n't shy , and so i was able to really enjoy myself , " he says .
" i wandered around and looked at the people .
everyone said ' hello ' or ' hi ' and that was it .
i just soaked up this incredible atmosphere . "
he did n't have much to eat or drink during the festival , and the continuous downpour was a nuisance , because while others had tents and camping equipment with them , frowein had nothing but his rain slicker .
he also did n't know quite what to make of the rampant drug use or the concept of free love .
" of course some people were running around in the nude , but that did n't really interest me , " he says .
" i was there to hear the music and to mingle with these people and see how they lived .
sex and drugs were part of it , but that did n't bother me . "
one of the main topics of conversation was the moon landing , which happened shortly before woodstock .
but for frowein , it was of little significance , being " too military " for his liking .
all that mattered was being able to experience first-hand the music greats of the day .
" when janis joplin died of an overdose not long after the festival , at least i was able to say that i had seen her perform live - that was very important for me , " he remembers .
cherished memories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso treasures the experience of woodstock after three days , frowein hit the road .
he hitchhiked back to new york and boarded a plane to germany .
back home , he saw how woodstock had become a huge media event , and how the music featured there was being played in all the bars and clubs .
he does n't often tell people that he was there - they would n't believe him anyway , he says .
today , dieter frowein manages an art supply shop in cologne .
in 1996 , he revisited the festival grounds in bethel , and took photos of the site .
but the real memories of those three crazy days full of music and colorful people in 1969 are firmly anchored in his mind .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.08.2009 opinion : merkel 's trip to sotchi about more than relations with russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting between rusian president dmitry medvedev and german chancellor angela merkel in sochi was heavy on german-russo relations .
but according to dw 's ingo manteufel , it was also part of merkel 's election campaign . how times have changed .
when german chancellor angela merkel met with russian president dmitry medvedev a year ago in sochi , the mood was icy .
the russia-georgia war had severely damaged relations between moscow and berlin .
but even though differences concerning georgia and russia 's conduct in the caucuses continue to exist , thanks to the global financial and economic crisis , the situation has visibly changed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel now both sides have called a truce and want to start rebuilding a strategic partnership .
the goal is to cooperate closely on several projects – saving the german auto company opel , helping preserve the waden yards collection of ship yards , and ensuring the continued existence of chip maker infinion .
but the declaration of intent for better german-russo economic cooperation was n't the surprising outcome of merkel 's visit to sochi .
germany and russia announced months ago that they planned to get through the economic crisis by working more together .
that fact was most recently made evident during a meeting between merkel and mevedev in munich one month ago .
inter-political chess match more interesting was the fact that merkel was able to use the trip to sochi to one-up her current vice chancellor and opponent for the chancellery , frank-walter steinmeier .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- may be in the lead six weeks ahead of federal elections in germany , but they have n't won yet , and every foreign trip is like a mini election campaign .
that 's even more true when it comes to visits with russian presidents .
ever since the male bonding that took place between gerhard schroeder and vladimir putin , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have tried to keep everything that has to do with russia in german politics all to themselves – even more so when it comes to frank-walter steinmeier .
over the past few years he has been a frequent and welcome guest at the kremlin , even during times of crisis .
under his leadership as foreign minister , the foreign ministry developed and propagated the concept of a german-russo modernization partnership , which is focused on linking the german and russian economies .
good relationships despite criticism with this trip to sochi focused on partnerships and cooperation merkel has taken this trump card away from steinmeier just weeks ahead of the elections .
what 's more is the fact that merkel demonstrated how good her relationship to president mevedev is while at the same time – as was clearly shown in the media – expressing her opinion about human rights in chechnya , which has clearly set her apart from steinmeier and his political foster father gerhard schroeder .
especially since the social democrats have always been criticized about their russia policies , which are seen as not critical enough when it comes to authoritarian tendencies and democratic deficits in russia .
the visit to sochi was a real political feat for merkel .
she reinforced a good political relationship with russia and made it clear she was supporting german jobs while at the same time taking the wind out of her opponent 's sails .
the fact that russian president medvedev willingly cooperated is n't only about the russian interest in opel .
even he must be aware of the polls in germany showing merkel in the lead and wants to be able to cash in on the good relations over the next four years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 15.08.2009 remembering woodstock , 40 years on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso experienced the hedonism first-hand forty years ago , dieter frowein-lyasso was an ex-army recruit looking for a way to blow off some steam when he heard about a music festival taking place in a town called woodstock .
the rest , as they say , is history . it was june , 1969 , and 24-year-old cologne native dieter frowein-lyasso had just finished his military service with the german army .
american soldiers stationed in the area told him about a big music festival happening in woodstock , near new york .
and he knew immediately - he had to go .
" i remember thinking that i had to get away from all the uniforms , the command structures , the obedience of the military , and that the best way to do that would be to mingle with people from a completely different world , " says frowein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein was looking for a release following military service the music lover promptly booked himself on a flight to new york .
he kept his plans secret , as he was determined to travel alone .
he used the money he got from the army as compensation for completing his military service to pay for the flight .
after arriving in new york , frowein found accommodation in a youth hostel , where he met a group of young people from the midwest who were also going to the festival .
" they simply took me along , because they thought it was so unusual that someone had come all the way from germany , " frowein says .
the only problem was , no one knew the way .
and when they finally did arrive in woodstock , they had a surprise waiting for them .
" woodstock ?
not here ! "
frowein remembers .
" instead , it was all taking place in the next town , which was bethel .
the people of woodstock did n't want to host it after all , so the organizers moved it the whole show to bethel , which is about three kilometers from woodstock . "
sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso says he stood out from the hippies frowein could n't speak much english , and his clothes were also very different from the styles worn by the " hippies " who had descended on the venue .
although he was dressed " normally , " he recalls feeling at home in the exotic surroundings .
" i was n't shy , and so i was able to really enjoy myself , " he says .
" i wandered around and looked at the people .
everyone said ' hello ' or ' hi ' and that was it .
i just soaked up this incredible atmosphere . "
he did n't have much to eat or drink during the festival , and the continuous downpour was a nuisance , because while others had tents and camping equipment with them , frowein had nothing but his rain slicker .
he also did n't know quite what to make of the rampant drug use or the concept of free love .
" of course some people were running around in the nude , but that did n't really interest me , " he says .
" i was there to hear the music and to mingle with these people and see how they lived .
sex and drugs were part of it , but that did n't bother me . "
one of the main topics of conversation was the moon landing , which happened shortly before woodstock .
but for frowein , it was of little significance , being " too military " for his liking .
all that mattered was being able to experience first-hand the music greats of the day .
" when janis joplin died of an overdose not long after the festival , at least i was able to say that i had seen her perform live - that was very important for me , " he remembers .
cherished memories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso treasures the experience of woodstock after three days , frowein hit the road .
he hitchhiked back to new york and boarded a plane to germany .
back home , he saw how woodstock had become a huge media event , and how the music featured there was being played in all the bars and clubs .
he does n't often tell people that he was there - they would n't believe him anyway , he says .
today , dieter frowein manages an art supply shop in cologne .
in 1996 , he revisited the festival grounds in bethel , and took photos of the site .
but the real memories of those three crazy days full of music and colorful people in 1969 are firmly anchored in his mind .
" one thing 's for certain , " he says .
" the whole experience sure helped to blow off the stodginess of my time with the german army ! "

the rest , as they say , is history . it was june , 1969 , and 24-year-old cologne native dieter frowein-lyasso had just finished his military service with the german army .
american soldiers stationed in the area told him about a big music festival happening in woodstock , near new york .
and he knew immediately - he had to go .
" i remember thinking that i had to get away from all the uniforms , the command structures , the obedience of the military , and that the best way to do that would be to mingle with people from a completely different world , " says frowein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein was looking for a release following military service the music lover promptly booked himself on a flight to new york .
he kept his plans secret , as he was determined to travel alone .
he used the money he got from the army as compensation for completing his military service to pay for the flight .
after arriving in new york , frowein found accommodation in a youth hostel , where he met a group of young people from the midwest who were also going to the festival .
" they simply took me along , because they thought it was so unusual that someone had come all the way from germany , " frowein says .
the only problem was , no one knew the way .
and when they finally did arrive in woodstock , they had a surprise waiting for them .
" woodstock ?
not here ! "
frowein remembers .
" instead , it was all taking place in the next town , which was bethel .
the people of woodstock did n't want to host it after all , so the organizers moved it the whole show to bethel , which is about three kilometers from woodstock . "
sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso says he stood out from the hippies frowein could n't speak much english , and his clothes were also very different from the styles worn by the " hippies " who had descended on the venue .
although he was dressed " normally , " he recalls feeling at home in the exotic surroundings .
" i was n't shy , and so i was able to really enjoy myself , " he says .
" i wandered around and looked at the people .
everyone said ' hello ' or ' hi ' and that was it .
i just soaked up this incredible atmosphere . "
he did n't have much to eat or drink during the festival , and the continuous downpour was a nuisance , because while others had tents and camping equipment with them , frowein had nothing but his rain slicker .
he also did n't know quite what to make of the rampant drug use or the concept of free love .
" of course some people were running around in the nude , but that did n't really interest me , " he says .
" i was there to hear the music and to mingle with these people and see how they lived .
sex and drugs were part of it , but that did n't bother me . "
one of the main topics of conversation was the moon landing , which happened shortly before woodstock .
but for frowein , it was of little significance , being " too military " for his liking .
all that mattered was being able to experience first-hand the music greats of the day .
" when janis joplin died of an overdose not long after the festival , at least i was able to say that i had seen her perform live - that was very important for me , " he remembers .
cherished memories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso treasures the experience of woodstock after three days , frowein hit the road .
he hitchhiked back to new york and boarded a plane to germany .
back home , he saw how woodstock had become a huge media event , and how the music featured there was being played in all the bars and clubs .
he does n't often tell people that he was there - they would n't believe him anyway , he says .
today , dieter frowein manages an art supply shop in cologne .
in 1996 , he revisited the festival grounds in bethel , and took photos of the site .
but the real memories of those three crazy days full of music and colorful people in 1969 are firmly anchored in his mind .
" one thing 's for certain , " he says .
" the whole experience sure helped to blow off the stodginess of my time with the german army ! "

but the group said friday the plan had not yet been finalized and would take a few more days to complete .
cengiz kapmaz , spokesman for the defense team for jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan , who has been incarcerated on imrali island since his 1999 conviction , confirmed that the roadmap would need more time .
" ocalan 's lawyers have not finished writing up his statements , " he said .
" the lawyers will return to the island on wednesday . "
the pkk plan , devised by ocalan , coincides with efforts by ankara to draw up kurdish-friendly policies in an attempt to win over the minority population and encourage the pkk to give up its armed struggle .
progress on the matter is considered integral to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
" by the end of the year we will begin with those measures of the kurdish initiative that can be implemented , " said turkish prime minister tayyip on friday .
although the turkish government has been urged to consider the ocalan plan , ankara has repeatedly refused to meet with officials from the pkk , which it , too , considers a terrorist organization .
the pkk is seeking autonomy for the kurdish minority in turkey , estimated at around 12 million people mainly in the east and southeast of the country .
according to estimates , the conflict has claimed as many as 45,000 lives. dfm / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the group said friday the plan had not yet been finalized and would take a few more days to complete .
cengiz kapmaz , spokesman for the defense team for jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan , who has been incarcerated on imrali island since his 1999 conviction , confirmed that the roadmap would need more time .
" ocalan 's lawyers have not finished writing up his statements , " he said .
" the lawyers will return to the island on wednesday . "
the pkk plan , devised by ocalan , coincides with efforts by ankara to draw up kurdish-friendly policies in an attempt to win over the minority population and encourage the pkk to give up its armed struggle .
progress on the matter is considered integral to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
" by the end of the year we will begin with those measures of the kurdish initiative that can be implemented , " said turkish prime minister tayyip on friday .
although the turkish government has been urged to consider the ocalan plan , ankara has repeatedly refused to meet with officials from the pkk , which it , too , considers a terrorist organization .
the pkk is seeking autonomy for the kurdish minority in turkey , estimated at around 12 million people mainly in the east and southeast of the country .
according to estimates , the conflict has claimed as many as 45,000 lives. dfm / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the attack comes just days before afghanistan 's national elections . the suicide car bomb was detonated near the gate of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- office in the wazir akbar khan district , where most of the major foreign embassies and organizations are located in afghanistan 's capital .
" unfortunately , there are casualties , " said canadian brigadier general eric tremblay , an isaf spokesman .
" there are afghan civilians and there are isaf military . "
taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid confirmed that the taliban was behind the bombing .
" it was carried out by one of our hero mujahid , ahmad , and the target was the us embassy and nato headquarters , " mujahid said in a telephone interview with the german news agency dpa .

independent election commission officials said this week that elections would not be able to be held in 10 districts unless those areas were secured .

but the group said friday the plan had not yet been finalized and would take a few more days to complete .
cengiz kapmaz , spokesman for the defense team for jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan , who has been incarcerated on imrali island since his 1999 conviction , confirmed that the roadmap would need more time .
" ocalan 's lawyers have not finished writing up his statements , " he said .
" the lawyers will return to the island on wednesday . "
the pkk plan , devised by ocalan , coincides with efforts by ankara to draw up kurdish-friendly policies in an attempt to win over the minority population and encourage the pkk to give up its armed struggle .
progress on the matter is considered integral to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
" by the end of the year we will begin with those measures of the kurdish initiative that can be implemented , " said turkish prime minister tayyip on friday .
although the turkish government has been urged to consider the ocalan plan , ankara has repeatedly refused to meet with officials from the pkk , which it , too , considers a terrorist organization .
the pkk is seeking autonomy for the kurdish minority in turkey , estimated at around 12 million people mainly in the east and southeast of the country .
according to estimates , the conflict has claimed as many as 45,000 lives. dfm / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 15.08.2009 taliban suicide bomb rocks kabul as afghanistan braces for elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing in kabul underscores concerns ahead of elections the taliban has claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing outside nato headquarters in kabul that killed seven afghans and injured nearly 100 others .
the attack comes just days before afghanistan 's national elections . the suicide car bomb was detonated near the gate of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- office in the wazir akbar khan district , where most of the major foreign embassies and organizations are located in afghanistan 's capital .
" unfortunately , there are casualties , " said canadian brigadier general eric tremblay , an isaf spokesman .
" there are afghan civilians and there are isaf military . "
taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid confirmed that the taliban was behind the bombing .
" it was carried out by one of our hero mujahid , ahmad , and the target was the us embassy and nato headquarters , " mujahid said in a telephone interview with the german news agency dpa .
the blast blew out windows and rattled building in the neighborhood and a large cloud of smoke rose from the site of the attack over kabul .
it also rattled the confidence of a nation preparing for only its second ever direct presidential election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the us have increased troop levels security in kabul and across the country has been tightened in advance of the august 20 polls , with 30,000 extra american troops in place .
security forces have increased their patrols and set up new checkpoints in kabul .
worries for election day but many observers and afghan civilians fear that the country is still not secure enough for an election .
despite the relative calm over the last several months , the taliban has conducted over 20 attacks against politicians taking part in the elections .
incumbent president hamid karzai 's running mate mohammad qasim fahin was attacked by militants in northern afghanistan and one cameraman was wounded .
two workers of karzai 's main challenger , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , were killed by gunmen .
" the government says it will install the polling stations in secure areas like the center of the district , but how can we go there from our village ? " asked rahim jan kako from the zherai district in southern afghanistan .
" i voted last time despite threats , but what the election brought us was killing and destruction . "
independent election commission officials said this week that elections would not be able to be held in 10 districts unless those areas were secured .
a mass abstention from the vote is currently being predicted by analysts .
such a low turnout could lead the new government to lack legitimacy in the eyes of the afghan people. hf / dpa / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german troops are expected to remain in afghanistan for another five to 10 years german defense minister rebuffs call for more troops in afghanistan german defense minister jung has spoken out against a call by the head of nato to deploy more troops in afghanistan as tension mounts over confirmation of the death of the taliban leader in neighboring pakistan .

" unfortunately , there are casualties , " said canadian brigadier general eric tremblay , an isaf spokesman .
" there are afghan civilians and there are isaf military . "
taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid confirmed that the taliban was behind the bombing .
" it was carried out by one of our hero mujahid , ahmad , and the target was the us embassy and nato headquarters , " mujahid said in a telephone interview with the german news agency dpa .
the blast blew out windows and rattled building in the neighborhood and a large cloud of smoke rose from the site of the attack over kabul .
it also rattled the confidence of a nation preparing for only its second ever direct presidential election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the us have increased troop levels security in kabul and across the country has been tightened in advance of the august 20 polls , with 30,000 extra american troops in place .
security forces have increased their patrols and set up new checkpoints in kabul .
worries for election day but many observers and afghan civilians fear that the country is still not secure enough for an election .
despite the relative calm over the last several months , the taliban has conducted over 20 attacks against politicians taking part in the elections .
incumbent president hamid karzai 's running mate mohammad qasim fahin was attacked by militants in northern afghanistan and one cameraman was wounded .
two workers of karzai 's main challenger , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , were killed by gunmen .
" the government says it will install the polling stations in secure areas like the center of the district , but how can we go there from our village ? " asked rahim jan kako from the zherai district in southern afghanistan .
" i voted last time despite threats , but what the election brought us was killing and destruction . "
independent election commission officials said this week that elections would not be able to be held in 10 districts unless those areas were secured .
a mass abstention from the vote is currently being predicted by analysts .
such a low turnout could lead the new government to lack legitimacy in the eyes of the afghan people. hf / dpa / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but according to dw 's ingo manteufel , it was also part of merkel 's election campaign . how times have changed .
when german chancellor angela merkel met with russian president dmitry medvedev a year ago in sochi , the mood was icy .
the russia-georgia war had severely damaged relations between moscow and berlin .
but even though differences concerning georgia and russia 's conduct in the caucuses continue to exist , thanks to the global financial and economic crisis , the situation has visibly changed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel now both sides have called a truce and want to start rebuilding a strategic partnership .
the goal is to cooperate closely on several projects – saving the german auto company opel , helping preserve the waden yards collection of ship yards , and ensuring the continued existence of chip maker infinion .
but the declaration of intent for better german-russo economic cooperation was n't the surprising outcome of merkel 's visit to sochi .
germany and russia announced months ago that they planned to get through the economic crisis by working more together .
that fact was most recently made evident during a meeting between merkel and mevedev in munich one month ago .
inter-political chess match more interesting was the fact that merkel was able to use the trip to sochi to one-up her current vice chancellor and opponent for the chancellery , frank-walter steinmeier .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- may be in the lead six weeks ahead of federal elections in germany , but they have n't won yet , and every foreign trip is like a mini election campaign .
that 's even more true when it comes to visits with russian presidents .
ever since the male bonding that took place between gerhard schroeder and vladimir putin , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have tried to keep everything that has to do with russia in german politics all to themselves – even more so when it comes to frank-walter steinmeier .
over the past few years he has been a frequent and welcome guest at the kremlin , even during times of crisis .
under his leadership as foreign minister , the foreign ministry developed and propagated the concept of a german-russo modernization partnership , which is focused on linking the german and russian economies .
good relationships despite criticism with this trip to sochi focused on partnerships and cooperation merkel has taken this trump card away from steinmeier just weeks ahead of the elections .
what 's more is the fact that merkel demonstrated how good her relationship to president mevedev is while at the same time – as was clearly shown in the media – expressing her opinion about human rights in chechnya , which has clearly set her apart from steinmeier and his political foster father gerhard schroeder .
especially since the social democrats have always been criticized about their russia policies , which are seen as not critical enough when it comes to authoritarian tendencies and democratic deficits in russia .
the visit to sochi was a real political feat for merkel .
she reinforced a good political relationship with russia and made it clear she was supporting german jobs while at the same time taking the wind out of her opponent 's sails .
the fact that russian president medvedev willingly cooperated is n't only about the russian interest in opel .
even he must be aware of the polls in germany showing merkel in the lead and wants to be able to cash in on the good relations over the next four years .

but according to dw 's ingo manteufel , it was also part of merkel 's election campaign . how times have changed .
when german chancellor angela merkel met with russian president dmitry medvedev a year ago in sochi , the mood was icy .
the russia-georgia war had severely damaged relations between moscow and berlin .
but even though differences concerning georgia and russia 's conduct in the caucuses continue to exist , thanks to the global financial and economic crisis , the situation has visibly changed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel now both sides have called a truce and want to start rebuilding a strategic partnership .
the goal is to cooperate closely on several projects – saving the german auto company opel , helping preserve the waden yards collection of ship yards , and ensuring the continued existence of chip maker infinion .
but the declaration of intent for better german-russo economic cooperation was n't the surprising outcome of merkel 's visit to sochi .
germany and russia announced months ago that they planned to get through the economic crisis by working more together .
that fact was most recently made evident during a meeting between merkel and mevedev in munich one month ago .
inter-political chess match more interesting was the fact that merkel was able to use the trip to sochi to one-up her current vice chancellor and opponent for the chancellery , frank-walter steinmeier .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- may be in the lead six weeks ahead of federal elections in germany , but they have n't won yet , and every foreign trip is like a mini election campaign .
that 's even more true when it comes to visits with russian presidents .
ever since the male bonding that took place between gerhard schroeder and vladimir putin , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have tried to keep everything that has to do with russia in german politics all to themselves – even more so when it comes to frank-walter steinmeier .
over the past few years he has been a frequent and welcome guest at the kremlin , even during times of crisis .
under his leadership as foreign minister , the foreign ministry developed and propagated the concept of a german-russo modernization partnership , which is focused on linking the german and russian economies .
good relationships despite criticism with this trip to sochi focused on partnerships and cooperation merkel has taken this trump card away from steinmeier just weeks ahead of the elections .
what 's more is the fact that merkel demonstrated how good her relationship to president mevedev is while at the same time – as was clearly shown in the media – expressing her opinion about human rights in chechnya , which has clearly set her apart from steinmeier and his political foster father gerhard schroeder .
especially since the social democrats have always been criticized about their russia policies , which are seen as not critical enough when it comes to authoritarian tendencies and democratic deficits in russia .
the visit to sochi was a real political feat for merkel .
she reinforced a good political relationship with russia and made it clear she was supporting german jobs while at the same time taking the wind out of her opponent 's sails .
the fact that russian president medvedev willingly cooperated is n't only about the russian interest in opel .
even he must be aware of the polls in germany showing merkel in the lead and wants to be able to cash in on the good relations over the next four years .

but the group said friday the plan had not yet been finalized and would take a few more days to complete .
cengiz kapmaz , spokesman for the defense team for jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan , who has been incarcerated on imrali island since his 1999 conviction , confirmed that the roadmap would need more time .
" ocalan 's lawyers have not finished writing up his statements , " he said .
" the lawyers will return to the island on wednesday . "
the pkk plan , devised by ocalan , coincides with efforts by ankara to draw up kurdish-friendly policies in an attempt to win over the minority population and encourage the pkk to give up its armed struggle .
progress on the matter is considered integral to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
" by the end of the year we will begin with those measures of the kurdish initiative that can be implemented , " said turkish prime minister tayyip on friday .
although the turkish government has been urged to consider the ocalan plan , ankara has repeatedly refused to meet with officials from the pkk , which it , too , considers a terrorist organization .
the pkk is seeking autonomy for the kurdish minority in turkey , estimated at around 12 million people mainly in the east and southeast of the country .
according to estimates , the conflict has claimed as many as 45,000 lives. dfm / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the group said friday the plan had not yet been finalized and would take a few more days to complete .
cengiz kapmaz , spokesman for the defense team for jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan , who has been incarcerated on imrali island since his 1999 conviction , confirmed that the roadmap would need more time .
" ocalan 's lawyers have not finished writing up his statements , " he said .
" the lawyers will return to the island on wednesday . "
the pkk plan , devised by ocalan , coincides with efforts by ankara to draw up kurdish-friendly policies in an attempt to win over the minority population and encourage the pkk to give up its armed struggle .
progress on the matter is considered integral to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
" by the end of the year we will begin with those measures of the kurdish initiative that can be implemented , " said turkish prime minister tayyip on friday .
although the turkish government has been urged to consider the ocalan plan , ankara has repeatedly refused to meet with officials from the pkk , which it , too , considers a terrorist organization .
the pkk is seeking autonomy for the kurdish minority in turkey , estimated at around 12 million people mainly in the east and southeast of the country .

but the group said friday the plan had not yet been finalized and would take a few more days to complete .
cengiz kapmaz , spokesman for the defense team for jailed pkk leader abdullah ocalan , who has been incarcerated on imrali island since his 1999 conviction , confirmed that the roadmap would need more time .
" ocalan 's lawyers have not finished writing up his statements , " he said .
" the lawyers will return to the island on wednesday . "
the pkk plan , devised by ocalan , coincides with efforts by ankara to draw up kurdish-friendly policies in an attempt to win over the minority population and encourage the pkk to give up its armed struggle .
progress on the matter is considered integral to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
" by the end of the year we will begin with those measures of the kurdish initiative that can be implemented , " said turkish prime minister tayyip on friday .
although the turkish government has been urged to consider the ocalan plan , ankara has repeatedly refused to meet with officials from the pkk , which it , too , considers a terrorist organization .
the pkk is seeking autonomy for the kurdish minority in turkey , estimated at around 12 million people mainly in the east and southeast of the country .
according to estimates , the conflict has claimed as many as 45,000 lives. dfm / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rest , as they say , is history . it was june , 1969 , and 24-year-old cologne native dieter frowein-lyasso had just finished his military service with the german army .
american soldiers stationed in the area told him about a big music festival happening in woodstock , near new york .
and he knew immediately - he had to go .
" i remember thinking that i had to get away from all the uniforms , the command structures , the obedience of the military , and that the best way to do that would be to mingle with people from a completely different world , " says frowein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein was looking for a release following military service the music lover promptly booked himself on a flight to new york .
he kept his plans secret , as he was determined to travel alone .
he used the money he got from the army as compensation for completing his military service to pay for the flight .
after arriving in new york , frowein found accommodation in a youth hostel , where he met a group of young people from the midwest who were also going to the festival .
" they simply took me along , because they thought it was so unusual that someone had come all the way from germany , " frowein says .
the only problem was , no one knew the way .
and when they finally did arrive in woodstock , they had a surprise waiting for them .
" woodstock ?
not here ! "
frowein remembers .
" instead , it was all taking place in the next town , which was bethel .
the people of woodstock did n't want to host it after all , so the organizers moved it the whole show to bethel , which is about three kilometers from woodstock . "
sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso says he stood out from the hippies frowein could n't speak much english , and his clothes were also very different from the styles worn by the " hippies " who had descended on the venue .
although he was dressed " normally , " he recalls feeling at home in the exotic surroundings .
" i was n't shy , and so i was able to really enjoy myself , " he says .
" i wandered around and looked at the people .
everyone said ' hello ' or ' hi ' and that was it .
i just soaked up this incredible atmosphere . "
he did n't have much to eat or drink during the festival , and the continuous downpour was a nuisance , because while others had tents and camping equipment with them , frowein had nothing but his rain slicker .
he also did n't know quite what to make of the rampant drug use or the concept of free love .
" of course some people were running around in the nude , but that did n't really interest me , " he says .
" i was there to hear the music and to mingle with these people and see how they lived .
sex and drugs were part of it , but that did n't bother me . "
one of the main topics of conversation was the moon landing , which happened shortly before woodstock .
but for frowein , it was of little significance , being " too military " for his liking .
all that mattered was being able to experience first-hand the music greats of the day .
" when janis joplin died of an overdose not long after the festival , at least i was able to say that i had seen her perform live - that was very important for me , " he remembers .
cherished memories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein-lyasso treasures the experience of woodstock after three days , frowein hit the road .
he hitchhiked back to new york and boarded a plane to germany .
back home , he saw how woodstock had become a huge media event , and how the music featured there was being played in all the bars and clubs .
he does n't often tell people that he was there - they would n't believe him anyway , he says .
today , dieter frowein manages an art supply shop in cologne .
in 1996 , he revisited the festival grounds in bethel , and took photos of the site .
but the real memories of those three crazy days full of music and colorful people in 1969 are firmly anchored in his mind .
" one thing 's for certain , " he says .
" the whole experience sure helped to blow off the stodginess of my time with the german army ! "

the rest , as they say , is history . it was june , 1969 , and 24-year-old cologne native dieter frowein-lyasso had just finished his military service with the german army .
american soldiers stationed in the area told him about a big music festival happening in woodstock , near new york .
and he knew immediately - he had to go .
" i remember thinking that i had to get away from all the uniforms , the command structures , the obedience of the military , and that the best way to do that would be to mingle with people from a completely different world , " says frowein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frowein was looking for a release following military service the music lover promptly booked himself on a flight to new york .
he kept his plans secret , as he was determined to travel alone .
he used the money he got from the army as compensation for completing his military service to pay for the flight .
after arriving in new york , frowein found accommodation in a youth hostel , where he met a group of young people from the midwest who were also going to the festival .
" they simply took me along , because they thought it was so unusual that someone had come all the way from germany , " frowein says .
the only problem was , no one knew the way .
and when they finally did arrive in woodstock , they had a surprise waiting for them .
" woodstock ?
not here ! "
frowein remembers .
" instead , it was all taking place in the next town , which was bethel .
the people of woodstock did n't want to host it after all , so the organizers moved it the whole show to bethel , which is about three kilometers from woodstock . "

" i was n't shy , and so i was able to really enjoy myself , " he says .
" i wandered around and looked at the people .
everyone said ' hello ' or ' hi ' and that was it .
i just soaked up this incredible atmosphere . "
he did n't have much to eat or drink during the festival , and the continuous downpour was a nuisance , because while others had tents and camping equipment with them , frowein had nothing but his rain slicker .

the attack comes just days before afghanistan 's national elections . the suicide car bomb was detonated near the gate of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- office in the wazir akbar khan district , where most of the major foreign embassies and organizations are located in afghanistan 's capital .
" unfortunately , there are casualties , " said canadian brigadier general eric tremblay , an isaf spokesman .
" there are afghan civilians and there are isaf military . "
taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid confirmed that the taliban was behind the bombing .
" it was carried out by one of our hero mujahid , ahmad , and the target was the us embassy and nato headquarters , " mujahid said in a telephone interview with the german news agency dpa .
the blast blew out windows and rattled building in the neighborhood and a large cloud of smoke rose from the site of the attack over kabul .
it also rattled the confidence of a nation preparing for only its second ever direct presidential election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the us have increased troop levels security in kabul and across the country has been tightened in advance of the august 20 polls , with 30,000 extra american troops in place .
security forces have increased their patrols and set up new checkpoints in kabul .
worries for election day but many observers and afghan civilians fear that the country is still not secure enough for an election .
despite the relative calm over the last several months , the taliban has conducted over 20 attacks against politicians taking part in the elections .
incumbent president hamid karzai 's running mate mohammad qasim fahin was attacked by militants in northern afghanistan and one cameraman was wounded .
two workers of karzai 's main challenger , former foreign minister abdullah abdullah , were killed by gunmen .
" the government says it will install the polling stations in secure areas like the center of the district , but how can we go there from our village ? " asked rahim jan kako from the zherai district in southern afghanistan .
" i voted last time despite threats , but what the election brought us was killing and destruction . "
independent election commission officials said this week that elections would not be able to be held in 10 districts unless those areas were secured .
a mass abstention from the vote is currently being predicted by analysts .
such a low turnout could lead the new government to lack legitimacy in the eyes of the afghan people. hf / dpa / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 15.08.2009 honoring the best of the wurst of german cuisine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german institution for over 60 years : the currywurst the currywurst , a german institution , finally has its own musuem in berlin .
housed in spacious premises in the central schuetzenstrasse , close to the former checkpoint charlie , the currywurst museum opens on august 15 . first dreamed up 60 years ago , the currywurst has long been a part of everyday life in the german capital .
everywhere you go in berlin you will find stalls serving the concoction of pork sausage , curry powder , and ketchup .
lots of ketchup .
" it 's less a meal , more an institution in berlin , " bellows a red- faced policeman , as he munches a currywurst at a stall in front of the city 's famous ruined memorial church .
more than 60 million of the sausages get prepared , devoured , spiced and served with pommes frites and rolls every year in berlin at hundreds of different street corner stalls , snack bars and restaurants .
so much so , that now an enterprising sausage lover has decided it 's time for the nation 's first " currywurst museum . "
martin loewer , its initiator and curator , has ploughed nearly five million euros -lrb- $ 7.1 million -rrb- into the project .
he reckons it will attract up to 350,000 visitors every year .
museum director birgit breloh is also enthusiastic , claiming the museum is a tribute to a phenomenon .
" no other german national dish inspires such excitement as the currywurst , " she enthuses .
the museum spotlights the history , origin and production of the currywurst , starting from the time sixty years ago when herta heuwer , a doughty berliner , first began selling the sausage with a special sauce she 'd invented , in the city 's charlottenburg district .
a special section of the museum is devoted to heuwer .
at the height of her activity in the early post-war years , she was selling more than 10,000 currywurst weekly at her stall .
film stars , theatre personalities and numerous local politicians were among her clients in that troubled period , when soviet forces encircled west berlin and the allied airlift operation was in full swing .
archive footage at the museum shows heuwer being interviewed on german television some 30 years ago when she was hailed as a " national heroine " by the audience , for introducing the dish to a grateful nation .
sausage paraphernalia throughout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum shows every aspect of the currywurst cult currywurst paraphernalia adorns the museum exhibition walls , with rooms kitted out with sausage-shaped benches and other accoutrements .
the " interactive exhibition " features interviews broadcast through speakers disguised as ketchup bottles , and a game played with curry powder shakers and fridges , containing traditional sausage-related german products .
no aspect of the currywurst " experience " gets overlooked .
the " rubbish for the future " section of the museum even has kind things to say about the paper cartons on which the sausages get served , claiming that the production and recycling processes deployed make the sausage an " eco-friendly " side-stall snack .
nostalgic keepsakes and souvenir items get offered for sale , including colored t-shirts emblazoned with the slogan " do n't worry - be curry . "
elsewhere in the museum , display space is also allotted to the controversial claim that hamburg , not berlin , is the true home of the sausage .
in the 1990s , uwe timm , a german writer , claimed that the sausage was first sold in the harbor area of hamburg after the war .
not so , seems to be the answer of the berlin museum promoters , who are backed up in their beliefs by gerd ruediger , a local currywurst expert , who insists the late herta heuwer was the sausage pioneer - in " proletarian , working-class berlin " in the post-war years .
a plethora of sausage types bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all the sausages on show are there to be eaten sausage-wise , different traditions sprang up during berlin 's 40- years of post-war division .
in the communist east , berliners tended to prefer their " fettwurst " - a fatty sausage which , when pierced , was likely to emit small fountains of fat .
in the western half of the city , where the currywurst was prepared with or without skin - according to taste - customers often preferred it prepared crisp and lightly charred .
the currywurst has many fans , as the museum zealously confirms .
when gerhard schroeder was germany 's chancellor a few years back , he would often be seen munching a chopped currywurst brought from a stall near the chancellery in the tiergarten .
walter momper , who was berlin 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- mayor the night the wall came down in 1989 , and who today is president of the local city parliament , is another great currywurst fan .
so too is ex-city mayor , eberhard diepgen .
he claims his enthusiasm for the sausage dates back to the days when he was a student at berlin 's free university in the 1960s .
the currywurst museum at 70 schuetzenstrasse will open on a daily basis , from 10am to 10pm .
entrance charge , 7-11 euros. nda / dpa / ap editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
