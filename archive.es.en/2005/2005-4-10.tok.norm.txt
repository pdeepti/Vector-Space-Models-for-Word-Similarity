many german clubs are now providing a special commentary service at stadiums for spectators with visual impairments . can the blind watch soccer ?
the answer is obviously " no " if one talks about using the eyes , but thanks to a special service in operation in a number of soccer stadiums in germany and elsewhere , the partially-sighted can enjoy everything a live game has to offer by watching with their ears . wolfgang gommersbach is a commentator at fc cologne 's rheinenergie stadium .
his job is to present the play-by-play action of the second division bundesliga outfit 's home games to his avid listeners . but gommersbach 's commentary is not destined for the wider airwaves .
in fact , the 26-year-old can see his listeners from his place in the stands .
his audience is the group of partially-sighted soccer fans wearing headphones who are going crazy for their team just a few tiers ahead of him . one of these supporters , markus simmon , is a long-time fan of the cologne club .
visually-impaired , simmon 's experience of his team 's matches has drastically improved in the last year thanks to the service provided for the club and the descriptive words of wolfgang gommersbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this service with the earphones and reporters has been in place since the second half of the 2004 season .
" before that , we would have to sit with a companion in the stadium , feeling the atmosphere but relying on comments from a friend , " says simmon . a feast of soccer for the ears thankfully , things are a lot different now , and with the world cup on its way to germany in 2006 , blind and partially-sighted fans will be able to enjoy the action in detail in stadiums around the country as more clubs roll out the service . " here , from the first minute to the last , you can see the whole game , " simmon enthuses , referring to the ' seeing with the ears ' principle the service promotes .
" you can hear some of the players , shouts from the field and crowd , the ball being kicked , the spectators and the reporter .
you get angry , you get happy , you jump around and you cheer . " whether it 's keeping up to date with all the action on the field or any announcements or changes that appear on the scoreboard , the visually-impaired fans get the full effect and atmosphere of match day tailored to their disability .
the specific nature of the service means that commentators are specially trained in their approach and delivery to make the commentary as informative as possible without taking anything for granted . all the action as it happens via headphones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in previous radio reports , only a few minutes of the action were reported , " says gommersbach .
also , a lot of the commentary available mixed facts and figures with match action , an approach which partially-sighted spectators found disorientating and led to missed incidents on the field .
" in this service , we really present what is happening on the pitch . " the commentary is only one of the services afforded to the blind and visually-impaired .
tickets range from just 5 to 6 euros -lrb- $ 6.40 - $ 7.60 -rrb- a game , hot and cold drinks are provided and wet and cold weather gear is also available if needed .
clubs offer around 15 places in their visually-impaired areas , but at the moment it 's rare for them to be sold out , such is the lack of publicity for the service .
but things could well change as more clubs adopt the technology which has been in germany for around six years . leverkusen lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium , home to bayer 04 leverkusen .
bundesliga club bayer leverkusen was the first to offer the listening service to its blind fans after seeing it pioneered by manchester united .
" we first saw the system five or six years ago in england and former club president kurt vossen then brought the idea to bayer leverkusen , " stephan rem , head of sports relations at the club explained .
" we brought in specialists in the technology and security to work on the visually-impaired compound and the whole thing then moved relatively fast . " since then , clubs such as schalke 04 , hamburg sv and vfl wolfsburg have adopted the system , while bayer leverkusen has worked to improving the service .
in the future , it is expected that all newly constructed stadiums , like bayern munich 's new allianz arena , will include the system . a world cup for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future looks , and sounds , good for blind spectators .
it is entirely possible that the world cup in 2006 will provide the launch pad for an explosion in partially-sighted spectators attending games , especially if those who visit german stadiums for the tournament get a view of world class soccer - through the ears , of course . alexandra jarecka -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making the internet visible for the blind researchers at germany 's fraunhofer institute are providing companies and government agencies with fast and free tips to make their web pages more accessible to those who are blind or live with other disabilities .

many german clubs are now providing a special commentary service at stadiums for spectators with visual impairments . can the blind watch soccer ?
the answer is obviously " no " if one talks about using the eyes , but thanks to a special service in operation in a number of soccer stadiums in germany and elsewhere , the partially-sighted can enjoy everything a live game has to offer by watching with their ears . wolfgang gommersbach is a commentator at fc cologne 's rheinenergie stadium .
his job is to present the play-by-play action of the second division bundesliga outfit 's home games to his avid listeners . but gommersbach 's commentary is not destined for the wider airwaves .
in fact , the 26-year-old can see his listeners from his place in the stands .
his audience is the group of partially-sighted soccer fans wearing headphones who are going crazy for their team just a few tiers ahead of him . one of these supporters , markus simmon , is a long-time fan of the cologne club .
visually-impaired , simmon 's experience of his team 's matches has drastically improved in the last year thanks to the service provided for the club and the descriptive words of wolfgang gommersbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this service with the earphones and reporters has been in place since the second half of the 2004 season .
" before that , we would have to sit with a companion in the stadium , feeling the atmosphere but relying on comments from a friend , " says simmon . a feast of soccer for the ears thankfully , things are a lot different now , and with the world cup on its way to germany in 2006 , blind and partially-sighted fans will be able to enjoy the action in detail in stadiums around the country as more clubs roll out the service . " here , from the first minute to the last , you can see the whole game , " simmon enthuses , referring to the ' seeing with the ears ' principle the service promotes .
" you can hear some of the players , shouts from the field and crowd , the ball being kicked , the spectators and the reporter .
you get angry , you get happy , you jump around and you cheer . " whether it 's keeping up to date with all the action on the field or any announcements or changes that appear on the scoreboard , the visually-impaired fans get the full effect and atmosphere of match day tailored to their disability .
the specific nature of the service means that commentators are specially trained in their approach and delivery to make the commentary as informative as possible without taking anything for granted . all the action as it happens via headphones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in previous radio reports , only a few minutes of the action were reported , " says gommersbach .
also , a lot of the commentary available mixed facts and figures with match action , an approach which partially-sighted spectators found disorientating and led to missed incidents on the field .
" in this service , we really present what is happening on the pitch . " the commentary is only one of the services afforded to the blind and visually-impaired .
tickets range from just 5 to 6 euros -lrb- $ 6.40 - $ 7.60 -rrb- a game , hot and cold drinks are provided and wet and cold weather gear is also available if needed .
clubs offer around 15 places in their visually-impaired areas , but at the moment it 's rare for them to be sold out , such is the lack of publicity for the service .
but things could well change as more clubs adopt the technology which has been in germany for around six years . leverkusen lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium , home to bayer 04 leverkusen .
bundesliga club bayer leverkusen was the first to offer the listening service to its blind fans after seeing it pioneered by manchester united .
" we first saw the system five or six years ago in england and former club president kurt vossen then brought the idea to bayer leverkusen , " stephan rem , head of sports relations at the club explained .
" we brought in specialists in the technology and security to work on the visually-impaired compound and the whole thing then moved relatively fast . " since then , clubs such as schalke 04 , hamburg sv and vfl wolfsburg have adopted the system , while bayer leverkusen has worked to improving the service .
in the future , it is expected that all newly constructed stadiums , like bayern munich 's new allianz arena , will include the system . a world cup for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future looks , and sounds , good for blind spectators .
it is entirely possible that the world cup in 2006 will provide the launch pad for an explosion in partially-sighted spectators attending games , especially if those who visit german stadiums for the tournament get a view of world class soccer - through the ears , of course . alexandra jarecka -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making the internet visible for the blind researchers at germany 's fraunhofer institute are providing companies and government agencies with fast and free tips to make their web pages more accessible to those who are blind or live with other disabilities .

" they warn us not to cave in to the temptation of forgetting and suppressing -lrb- the past -rrb- , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : form left to right , brandenburg premier matthias platzek , spanish author and buchenwald survior jorge semprun , bundestag president wolfgang thierse and german chancellor gerhard schröder in weimar during the memorial ceremony .
the chancellor assured that democratic germany would not allow injustice and violence , anti-semitism , racism and xenophobia another chance . he added that the memory of the nazi era , war , genocide and crimes against humanity had become a part of german identity and remained a moral obligation .
" these values must always be defended anew , " the chancellor said . " the death of millions , the suffering of the survivors , the torment of the victims - this is the basis of our task to create a better future , " he said .
" we can not change history , but this country can learn a lot from the deepest shame of our history . " " a miracle to be alive " the memorial concert in weimar was attended by leader of the conservative opposition , angela merkel as well as paul spiegel , head of the central council of jews in germany and nobel literature laureate imre kertesz of hungary , who wrote a chilling novel about his time at buchenwald . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 80-year-old phil elberg from brussels , who was interned in buchenwald from 1944 to 1945 .
in addition , former inmates of the camp - many now well into their 80s - were also scheduled to speak of their experiences .
on saturday , several former inmates re-visited the camp to remember the events that happened there . one of them was pavel kohn who arrived in the camp as a 15-year-old jewish orphan and was among the lucky ones rescued by us troops who freed buchenwald 60 years ago . " it was close to a miracle that i was still alive , " kohn told news agency associated press .
" although i was just a bit older than 15 , nothing could surprise me anymore in terms of cruelty . " more than 56,000 killed the buchenwald concentration camp was set up by the nazis in 1937 for the internment of jews , roma , homosexuals and political opponents of hitler 's regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this april 16 , 1945 photo shows inmates of the german camp buchenwald inside their barrack , a few days after u.s troops of the 80th division liberated this concentration camp near weimar .
though there were no gas chambers at the camp , prisoners were subjected to extreme cold and starvation .
" the camp was packed , there was hunger , and the living conditions and hygiene were unbelievable , " kohn told associated press . prisoners at the camp were forced to build roads and railways to assist the nazi war machine . scientists plundered some of the dead prisoners ' bodies for research purposes .
more than 56,000 people were murdered there between 1937 and 1945 .

" " it is clear that the german children , subjected to feelings of ethnic hate from the danes , paid dearly for their parents ' mistakes , " lylloff said in an interview on danish public television station dr1 . " and when we hear about ethnic cleansing and talk about the monstrosities committed against the hutus and the tutsis in rwanda for instance , or in the balkans , we should remember that we were driven by the same norms due to ethnic hatred , " she told danish daily politiken . contradicts accepted history lylloff 's thesis , written after nearly two years of pouring over witness testimonies and other research , contradicts most danish history books which tend to portray the danish treatment of germans after the war as good . " this chapter should be rewritten , because the reality was quite different , " she said , pointing out that neither danish authorities nor the danish red cross had come to the german children 's rescue . " this is a sad , black chapter in danish history on a humanitarian level of which we should be ashamed , " head of the danish red cross joergen poulsen told afp . he insisted however that the danish government at the time had not wanted the red cross to help the children , and that local units of the organization that had wanted to help could n't due to " the animosity of the danish population towards the germans .

" these values must always be defended anew , " the chancellor said . " the death of millions , the suffering of the survivors , the torment of the victims - this is the basis of our task to create a better future , " he said .
" we can not change history , but this country can learn a lot from the deepest shame of our history .

on saturday , several former inmates re-visited the camp to remember the events that happened there . one of them was pavel kohn who arrived in the camp as a 15-year-old jewish orphan and was among the lucky ones rescued by us troops who freed buchenwald 60 years ago . " it was close to a miracle that i was still alive , " kohn told news agency associated press .
" although i was just a bit older than 15 , nothing could surprise me anymore in terms of cruelty . " more than 56,000 killed the buchenwald concentration camp was set up by the nazis in 1937 for the internment of jews , roma , homosexuals and political opponents of hitler 's regime .

though there were no gas chambers at the camp , prisoners were subjected to extreme cold and starvation .
" the camp was packed , there was hunger , and the living conditions and hygiene were unbelievable , " kohn told associated press . prisoners at the camp were forced to build roads and railways to assist the nazi war machine . scientists plundered some of the dead prisoners ' bodies for research purposes .
more than 56,000 people were murdered there between 1937 and 1945 .
on april 11 , 1945 , us troops reached the camp and freed around 21,000 prisoners .

the buchenwald anniversary came more than two months after an emotional ceremony for the liberation of the nazis ' auschwitz death camp where more than one million people died .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.04.2005 the sound of soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special commentary can make the game come alive for blind fans being blind or partially-sighted is no longer a barrier to enjoying the visual spectacle of soccer .
many german clubs are now providing a special commentary service at stadiums for spectators with visual impairments . can the blind watch soccer ?
the answer is obviously " no " if one talks about using the eyes , but thanks to a special service in operation in a number of soccer stadiums in germany and elsewhere , the partially-sighted can enjoy everything a live game has to offer by watching with their ears . wolfgang gommersbach is a commentator at fc cologne 's rheinenergie stadium .
his job is to present the play-by-play action of the second division bundesliga outfit 's home games to his avid listeners . but gommersbach 's commentary is not destined for the wider airwaves .
in fact , the 26-year-old can see his listeners from his place in the stands .
his audience is the group of partially-sighted soccer fans wearing headphones who are going crazy for their team just a few tiers ahead of him . one of these supporters , markus simmon , is a long-time fan of the cologne club .
visually-impaired , simmon 's experience of his team 's matches has drastically improved in the last year thanks to the service provided for the club and the descriptive words of wolfgang gommersbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this service with the earphones and reporters has been in place since the second half of the 2004 season .
" before that , we would have to sit with a companion in the stadium , feeling the atmosphere but relying on comments from a friend , " says simmon . a feast of soccer for the ears thankfully , things are a lot different now , and with the world cup on its way to germany in 2006 , blind and partially-sighted fans will be able to enjoy the action in detail in stadiums around the country as more clubs roll out the service . " here , from the first minute to the last , you can see the whole game , " simmon enthuses , referring to the ' seeing with the ears ' principle the service promotes .
" you can hear some of the players , shouts from the field and crowd , the ball being kicked , the spectators and the reporter .
you get angry , you get happy , you jump around and you cheer .

many german clubs are now providing a special commentary service at stadiums for spectators with visual impairments . can the blind watch soccer ?
the answer is obviously " no " if one talks about using the eyes , but thanks to a special service in operation in a number of soccer stadiums in germany and elsewhere , the partially-sighted can enjoy everything a live game has to offer by watching with their ears . wolfgang gommersbach is a commentator at fc cologne 's rheinenergie stadium .
his job is to present the play-by-play action of the second division bundesliga outfit 's home games to his avid listeners . but gommersbach 's commentary is not destined for the wider airwaves .
in fact , the 26-year-old can see his listeners from his place in the stands .
his audience is the group of partially-sighted soccer fans wearing headphones who are going crazy for their team just a few tiers ahead of him . one of these supporters , markus simmon , is a long-time fan of the cologne club .
visually-impaired , simmon 's experience of his team 's matches has drastically improved in the last year thanks to the service provided for the club and the descriptive words of wolfgang gommersbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this service with the earphones and reporters has been in place since the second half of the 2004 season .
" before that , we would have to sit with a companion in the stadium , feeling the atmosphere but relying on comments from a friend , " says simmon . a feast of soccer for the ears thankfully , things are a lot different now , and with the world cup on its way to germany in 2006 , blind and partially-sighted fans will be able to enjoy the action in detail in stadiums around the country as more clubs roll out the service . " here , from the first minute to the last , you can see the whole game , " simmon enthuses , referring to the ' seeing with the ears ' principle the service promotes .
" you can hear some of the players , shouts from the field and crowd , the ball being kicked , the spectators and the reporter .
you get angry , you get happy , you jump around and you cheer . " whether it 's keeping up to date with all the action on the field or any announcements or changes that appear on the scoreboard , the visually-impaired fans get the full effect and atmosphere of match day tailored to their disability .

" " it is clear that the german children , subjected to feelings of ethnic hate from the danes , paid dearly for their parents ' mistakes , " lylloff said in an interview on danish public television station dr1 . " and when we hear about ethnic cleansing and talk about the monstrosities committed against the hutus and the tutsis in rwanda for instance , or in the balkans , we should remember that we were driven by the same norms due to ethnic hatred , " she told danish daily politiken . contradicts accepted history lylloff 's thesis , written after nearly two years of pouring over witness testimonies and other research , contradicts most danish history books which tend to portray the danish treatment of germans after the war as good . " this chapter should be rewritten , because the reality was quite different , " she said , pointing out that neither danish authorities nor the danish red cross had come to the german children 's rescue . " this is a sad , black chapter in danish history on a humanitarian level of which we should be ashamed , " head of the danish red cross joergen poulsen told afp . he insisted however that the danish government at the time had not wanted the red cross to help the children , and that local units of the organization that had wanted to help could n't due to " the animosity of the danish population towards the germans .

many german clubs are now providing a special commentary service at stadiums for spectators with visual impairments . can the blind watch soccer ?
the answer is obviously " no " if one talks about using the eyes , but thanks to a special service in operation in a number of soccer stadiums in germany and elsewhere , the partially-sighted can enjoy everything a live game has to offer by watching with their ears . wolfgang gommersbach is a commentator at fc cologne 's rheinenergie stadium .
his job is to present the play-by-play action of the second division bundesliga outfit 's home games to his avid listeners . but gommersbach 's commentary is not destined for the wider airwaves .
in fact , the 26-year-old can see his listeners from his place in the stands .
his audience is the group of partially-sighted soccer fans wearing headphones who are going crazy for their team just a few tiers ahead of him . one of these supporters , markus simmon , is a long-time fan of the cologne club .
visually-impaired , simmon 's experience of his team 's matches has drastically improved in the last year thanks to the service provided for the club and the descriptive words of wolfgang gommersbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this service with the earphones and reporters has been in place since the second half of the 2004 season .
" before that , we would have to sit with a companion in the stadium , feeling the atmosphere but relying on comments from a friend , " says simmon . a feast of soccer for the ears thankfully , things are a lot different now , and with the world cup on its way to germany in 2006 , blind and partially-sighted fans will be able to enjoy the action in detail in stadiums around the country as more clubs roll out the service . " here , from the first minute to the last , you can see the whole game , " simmon enthuses , referring to the ' seeing with the ears ' principle the service promotes .
" you can hear some of the players , shouts from the field and crowd , the ball being kicked , the spectators and the reporter .

" whether it 's keeping up to date with all the action on the field or any announcements or changes that appear on the scoreboard , the visually-impaired fans get the full effect and atmosphere of match day tailored to their disability .
the specific nature of the service means that commentators are specially trained in their approach and delivery to make the commentary as informative as possible without taking anything for granted . all the action as it happens via headphones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in previous radio reports , only a few minutes of the action were reported , " says gommersbach .
also , a lot of the commentary available mixed facts and figures with match action , an approach which partially-sighted spectators found disorientating and led to missed incidents on the field .
" in this service , we really present what is happening on the pitch . " the commentary is only one of the services afforded to the blind and visually-impaired .

" before that , we would have to sit with a companion in the stadium , feeling the atmosphere but relying on comments from a friend , " says simmon . a feast of soccer for the ears thankfully , things are a lot different now , and with the world cup on its way to germany in 2006 , blind and partially-sighted fans will be able to enjoy the action in detail in stadiums around the country as more clubs roll out the service . " here , from the first minute to the last , you can see the whole game , " simmon enthuses , referring to the ' seeing with the ears ' principle the service promotes .
" you can hear some of the players , shouts from the field and crowd , the ball being kicked , the spectators and the reporter .
you get angry , you get happy , you jump around and you cheer . " whether it 's keeping up to date with all the action on the field or any announcements or changes that appear on the scoreboard , the visually-impaired fans get the full effect and atmosphere of match day tailored to their disability .
the specific nature of the service means that commentators are specially trained in their approach and delivery to make the commentary as informative as possible without taking anything for granted . all the action as it happens via headphones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in previous radio reports , only a few minutes of the action were reported , " says gommersbach .
also , a lot of the commentary available mixed facts and figures with match action , an approach which partially-sighted spectators found disorientating and led to missed incidents on the field .
" in this service , we really present what is happening on the pitch . " the commentary is only one of the services afforded to the blind and visually-impaired .
tickets range from just 5 to 6 euros -lrb- $ 6.40 - $ 7.60 -rrb- a game , hot and cold drinks are provided and wet and cold weather gear is also available if needed .
clubs offer around 15 places in their visually-impaired areas , but at the moment it 's rare for them to be sold out , such is the lack of publicity for the service .
but things could well change as more clubs adopt the technology which has been in germany for around six years . leverkusen lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium , home to bayer 04 leverkusen .
bundesliga club bayer leverkusen was the first to offer the listening service to its blind fans after seeing it pioneered by manchester united .
" we first saw the system five or six years ago in england and former club president kurt vossen then brought the idea to bayer leverkusen , " stephan rem , head of sports relations at the club explained .
" we brought in specialists in the technology and security to work on the visually-impaired compound and the whole thing then moved relatively fast . " since then , clubs such as schalke 04 , hamburg sv and vfl wolfsburg have adopted the system , while bayer leverkusen has worked to improving the service .
in the future , it is expected that all newly constructed stadiums , like bayern munich 's new allianz arena , will include the system . a world cup for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future looks , and sounds , good for blind spectators .
it is entirely possible that the world cup in 2006 will provide the launch pad for an explosion in partially-sighted spectators attending games , especially if those who visit german stadiums for the tournament get a view of world class soccer - through the ears , of course . alexandra jarecka -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making the internet visible for the blind researchers at germany 's fraunhofer institute are providing companies and government agencies with fast and free tips to make their web pages more accessible to those who are blind or live with other disabilities .

human rights groups have however warned the chancellor not to play down putin 's policies in chechnya . amid tight security , russian premier vladimir putin and german chancellor gerhard schröder jointly opened the hanover industrial trade fair , the largest of its kind in the world .
over 6,000 exhibitors from 65 countries - 1,000 more than last year - are displaying their products this year . as the partner country of this year 's fair , russia is to take center stage as it attempts to lure investors in germany .
the show is also hoped to boost germany 's floundering economy and provide a fresh impetus to the key industry of machine manufacturing .
" i am looking forward to our meeting in hanover which will undoubtedly lead to the further development of the russian-german partnership , " putin told schröder by telephone this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president wladimir putin , left with german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder maintains a close friendship with putin , and recently underlined the importance of ensuring russia is involved in europe 's planning .

putin is accompanied by the pro-moscow president of the breakaway region of chechnya , alu alkhanov and deputy ramsan kayrow . human rights activists in germany are using the occasion to stage a vigil in hanover outside the trade fair grounds to protest against alkhanov 's visit .
the society for endangered people has accused the chechnyan politician of grave human rights violations and said he is responsible for the torture and murder of his fellow countryman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protest against putin 's chechnya policies and his visit in hamburg in dec .

human rights organization amnesty international too has urged german chancellor schröder not to play down russian president putin 's human rights and chechnya policies during his visit .
the organization said in a statement that the human rights situation in chechnya remained unchanged and bad . eu aid to victims of chechnyan conflict alkhanov it is reported will use the trip to meet representatives of german humanitarian organizations about what they can do towards rebuilding war-shattered chechnya within the framework of eu reconstruction efforts .
the idea of involving the german humanitarian organizations was raised during putin 's visit to germany in december . the european union 's executive commission announced on thursday it was giving 22.5 million euros -lrb- $ 29.1 million -rrb- in aid to victims of the conflict in chechnya where separatists and islamic militants have been fighting pro-russian forces in chechnya for more than five years . the funds , the first to be made available this year , come on top of 148 million euros already handed out by brussels ' humanitarian aid agency echo since the beginning of the conflict in 1999 . ties between moscow and brussels have long been strained over what the eu sees as human rights abuses by the russian army as it tries to regain control over rebel chechnya . eu mission to chechnya on monday , the european union is to send a team to chechnya to look at ways of giving economic and reconstruction aid , the first time the bloc has tried to give such help there .
the team would also visit the neighboring republics of ingushetia and north ossetia . the team of around 10 officials from brussels and the commission 's moscow office will be in the region from april 9 to 16 , and will visit the health , education and economy ministries in each of the three republics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.04.2005 the sound of soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special commentary can make the game come alive for blind fans being blind or partially-sighted is no longer a barrier to enjoying the visual spectacle of soccer .
many german clubs are now providing a special commentary service at stadiums for spectators with visual impairments . can the blind watch soccer ?
the answer is obviously " no " if one talks about using the eyes , but thanks to a special service in operation in a number of soccer stadiums in germany and elsewhere , the partially-sighted can enjoy everything a live game has to offer by watching with their ears . wolfgang gommersbach is a commentator at fc cologne 's rheinenergie stadium .
his job is to present the play-by-play action of the second division bundesliga outfit 's home games to his avid listeners . but gommersbach 's commentary is not destined for the wider airwaves .
in fact , the 26-year-old can see his listeners from his place in the stands .
his audience is the group of partially-sighted soccer fans wearing headphones who are going crazy for their team just a few tiers ahead of him . one of these supporters , markus simmon , is a long-time fan of the cologne club .
visually-impaired , simmon 's experience of his team 's matches has drastically improved in the last year thanks to the service provided for the club and the descriptive words of wolfgang gommersbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this service with the earphones and reporters has been in place since the second half of the 2004 season .
" before that , we would have to sit with a companion in the stadium , feeling the atmosphere but relying on comments from a friend , " says simmon . a feast of soccer for the ears thankfully , things are a lot different now , and with the world cup on its way to germany in 2006 , blind and partially-sighted fans will be able to enjoy the action in detail in stadiums around the country as more clubs roll out the service . " here , from the first minute to the last , you can see the whole game , " simmon enthuses , referring to the ' seeing with the ears ' principle the service promotes .
" you can hear some of the players , shouts from the field and crowd , the ball being kicked , the spectators and the reporter .
you get angry , you get happy , you jump around and you cheer . " whether it 's keeping up to date with all the action on the field or any announcements or changes that appear on the scoreboard , the visually-impaired fans get the full effect and atmosphere of match day tailored to their disability .
the specific nature of the service means that commentators are specially trained in their approach and delivery to make the commentary as informative as possible without taking anything for granted . all the action as it happens via headphones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in previous radio reports , only a few minutes of the action were reported , " says gommersbach .
also , a lot of the commentary available mixed facts and figures with match action , an approach which partially-sighted spectators found disorientating and led to missed incidents on the field .
" in this service , we really present what is happening on the pitch . " the commentary is only one of the services afforded to the blind and visually-impaired .
tickets range from just 5 to 6 euros -lrb- $ 6.40 - $ 7.60 -rrb- a game , hot and cold drinks are provided and wet and cold weather gear is also available if needed .
clubs offer around 15 places in their visually-impaired areas , but at the moment it 's rare for them to be sold out , such is the lack of publicity for the service .
but things could well change as more clubs adopt the technology which has been in germany for around six years . leverkusen lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium , home to bayer 04 leverkusen .
bundesliga club bayer leverkusen was the first to offer the listening service to its blind fans after seeing it pioneered by manchester united .
" we first saw the system five or six years ago in england and former club president kurt vossen then brought the idea to bayer leverkusen , " stephan rem , head of sports relations at the club explained .
" we brought in specialists in the technology and security to work on the visually-impaired compound and the whole thing then moved relatively fast . " since then , clubs such as schalke 04 , hamburg sv and vfl wolfsburg have adopted the system , while bayer leverkusen has worked to improving the service .
in the future , it is expected that all newly constructed stadiums , like bayern munich 's new allianz arena , will include the system . a world cup for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future looks , and sounds , good for blind spectators .
it is entirely possible that the world cup in 2006 will provide the launch pad for an explosion in partially-sighted spectators attending games , especially if those who visit german stadiums for the tournament get a view of world class soccer - through the ears , of course . alexandra jarecka -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making the internet visible for the blind researchers at germany 's fraunhofer institute are providing companies and government agencies with fast and free tips to make their web pages more accessible to those who are blind or live with other disabilities .

" " it is clear that the german children , subjected to feelings of ethnic hate from the danes , paid dearly for their parents ' mistakes , " lylloff said in an interview on danish public television station dr1 . " and when we hear about ethnic cleansing and talk about the monstrosities committed against the hutus and the tutsis in rwanda for instance , or in the balkans , we should remember that we were driven by the same norms due to ethnic hatred , " she told danish daily politiken . contradicts accepted history lylloff 's thesis , written after nearly two years of pouring over witness testimonies and other research , contradicts most danish history books which tend to portray the danish treatment of germans after the war as good . " this chapter should be rewritten , because the reality was quite different , " she said , pointing out that neither danish authorities nor the danish red cross had come to the german children 's rescue . " this is a sad , black chapter in danish history on a humanitarian level of which we should be ashamed , " head of the danish red cross joergen poulsen told afp . he insisted however that the danish government at the time had not wanted the red cross to help the children , and that local units of the organization that had wanted to help could n't due to " the animosity of the danish population towards the germans .

many german clubs are now providing a special commentary service at stadiums for spectators with visual impairments . can the blind watch soccer ?
the answer is obviously " no " if one talks about using the eyes , but thanks to a special service in operation in a number of soccer stadiums in germany and elsewhere , the partially-sighted can enjoy everything a live game has to offer by watching with their ears . wolfgang gommersbach is a commentator at fc cologne 's rheinenergie stadium .
his job is to present the play-by-play action of the second division bundesliga outfit 's home games to his avid listeners . but gommersbach 's commentary is not destined for the wider airwaves .
in fact , the 26-year-old can see his listeners from his place in the stands .
his audience is the group of partially-sighted soccer fans wearing headphones who are going crazy for their team just a few tiers ahead of him . one of these supporters , markus simmon , is a long-time fan of the cologne club .
visually-impaired , simmon 's experience of his team 's matches has drastically improved in the last year thanks to the service provided for the club and the descriptive words of wolfgang gommersbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this service with the earphones and reporters has been in place since the second half of the 2004 season .
" before that , we would have to sit with a companion in the stadium , feeling the atmosphere but relying on comments from a friend , " says simmon . a feast of soccer for the ears thankfully , things are a lot different now , and with the world cup on its way to germany in 2006 , blind and partially-sighted fans will be able to enjoy the action in detail in stadiums around the country as more clubs roll out the service . " here , from the first minute to the last , you can see the whole game , " simmon enthuses , referring to the ' seeing with the ears ' principle the service promotes .
" you can hear some of the players , shouts from the field and crowd , the ball being kicked , the spectators and the reporter .
you get angry , you get happy , you jump around and you cheer . " whether it 's keeping up to date with all the action on the field or any announcements or changes that appear on the scoreboard , the visually-impaired fans get the full effect and atmosphere of match day tailored to their disability .
the specific nature of the service means that commentators are specially trained in their approach and delivery to make the commentary as informative as possible without taking anything for granted . all the action as it happens via headphones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in previous radio reports , only a few minutes of the action were reported , " says gommersbach .
also , a lot of the commentary available mixed facts and figures with match action , an approach which partially-sighted spectators found disorientating and led to missed incidents on the field .
" in this service , we really present what is happening on the pitch . " the commentary is only one of the services afforded to the blind and visually-impaired .
tickets range from just 5 to 6 euros -lrb- $ 6.40 - $ 7.60 -rrb- a game , hot and cold drinks are provided and wet and cold weather gear is also available if needed .
clubs offer around 15 places in their visually-impaired areas , but at the moment it 's rare for them to be sold out , such is the lack of publicity for the service .
but things could well change as more clubs adopt the technology which has been in germany for around six years . leverkusen lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium , home to bayer 04 leverkusen .
bundesliga club bayer leverkusen was the first to offer the listening service to its blind fans after seeing it pioneered by manchester united .
" we first saw the system five or six years ago in england and former club president kurt vossen then brought the idea to bayer leverkusen , " stephan rem , head of sports relations at the club explained .
" we brought in specialists in the technology and security to work on the visually-impaired compound and the whole thing then moved relatively fast . " since then , clubs such as schalke 04 , hamburg sv and vfl wolfsburg have adopted the system , while bayer leverkusen has worked to improving the service .
in the future , it is expected that all newly constructed stadiums , like bayern munich 's new allianz arena , will include the system . a world cup for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future looks , and sounds , good for blind spectators .
it is entirely possible that the world cup in 2006 will provide the launch pad for an explosion in partially-sighted spectators attending games , especially if those who visit german stadiums for the tournament get a view of world class soccer - through the ears , of course . alexandra jarecka -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making the internet visible for the blind researchers at germany 's fraunhofer institute are providing companies and government agencies with fast and free tips to make their web pages more accessible to those who are blind or live with other disabilities .

many german clubs are now providing a special commentary service at stadiums for spectators with visual impairments . can the blind watch soccer ?
the answer is obviously " no " if one talks about using the eyes , but thanks to a special service in operation in a number of soccer stadiums in germany and elsewhere , the partially-sighted can enjoy everything a live game has to offer by watching with their ears . wolfgang gommersbach is a commentator at fc cologne 's rheinenergie stadium .
his job is to present the play-by-play action of the second division bundesliga outfit 's home games to his avid listeners . but gommersbach 's commentary is not destined for the wider airwaves .
in fact , the 26-year-old can see his listeners from his place in the stands .
his audience is the group of partially-sighted soccer fans wearing headphones who are going crazy for their team just a few tiers ahead of him . one of these supporters , markus simmon , is a long-time fan of the cologne club .
visually-impaired , simmon 's experience of his team 's matches has drastically improved in the last year thanks to the service provided for the club and the descriptive words of wolfgang gommersbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this service with the earphones and reporters has been in place since the second half of the 2004 season .
" before that , we would have to sit with a companion in the stadium , feeling the atmosphere but relying on comments from a friend , " says simmon . a feast of soccer for the ears thankfully , things are a lot different now , and with the world cup on its way to germany in 2006 , blind and partially-sighted fans will be able to enjoy the action in detail in stadiums around the country as more clubs roll out the service . " here , from the first minute to the last , you can see the whole game , " simmon enthuses , referring to the ' seeing with the ears ' principle the service promotes .
" you can hear some of the players , shouts from the field and crowd , the ball being kicked , the spectators and the reporter .
you get angry , you get happy , you jump around and you cheer . " whether it 's keeping up to date with all the action on the field or any announcements or changes that appear on the scoreboard , the visually-impaired fans get the full effect and atmosphere of match day tailored to their disability .
the specific nature of the service means that commentators are specially trained in their approach and delivery to make the commentary as informative as possible without taking anything for granted . all the action as it happens via headphones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in previous radio reports , only a few minutes of the action were reported , " says gommersbach .
also , a lot of the commentary available mixed facts and figures with match action , an approach which partially-sighted spectators found disorientating and led to missed incidents on the field .
" in this service , we really present what is happening on the pitch . " the commentary is only one of the services afforded to the blind and visually-impaired .
tickets range from just 5 to 6 euros -lrb- $ 6.40 - $ 7.60 -rrb- a game , hot and cold drinks are provided and wet and cold weather gear is also available if needed .
clubs offer around 15 places in their visually-impaired areas , but at the moment it 's rare for them to be sold out , such is the lack of publicity for the service .
but things could well change as more clubs adopt the technology which has been in germany for around six years . leverkusen lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium , home to bayer 04 leverkusen .
bundesliga club bayer leverkusen was the first to offer the listening service to its blind fans after seeing it pioneered by manchester united .
" we first saw the system five or six years ago in england and former club president kurt vossen then brought the idea to bayer leverkusen , " stephan rem , head of sports relations at the club explained .
" we brought in specialists in the technology and security to work on the visually-impaired compound and the whole thing then moved relatively fast . " since then , clubs such as schalke 04 , hamburg sv and vfl wolfsburg have adopted the system , while bayer leverkusen has worked to improving the service .
in the future , it is expected that all newly constructed stadiums , like bayern munich 's new allianz arena , will include the system . a world cup for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future looks , and sounds , good for blind spectators .
it is entirely possible that the world cup in 2006 will provide the launch pad for an explosion in partially-sighted spectators attending games , especially if those who visit german stadiums for the tournament get a view of world class soccer - through the ears , of course . alexandra jarecka -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making the internet visible for the blind researchers at germany 's fraunhofer institute are providing companies and government agencies with fast and free tips to make their web pages more accessible to those who are blind or live with other disabilities .

many german clubs are now providing a special commentary service at stadiums for spectators with visual impairments . can the blind watch soccer ?
the answer is obviously " no " if one talks about using the eyes , but thanks to a special service in operation in a number of soccer stadiums in germany and elsewhere , the partially-sighted can enjoy everything a live game has to offer by watching with their ears . wolfgang gommersbach is a commentator at fc cologne 's rheinenergie stadium .
his job is to present the play-by-play action of the second division bundesliga outfit 's home games to his avid listeners . but gommersbach 's commentary is not destined for the wider airwaves .
in fact , the 26-year-old can see his listeners from his place in the stands .
his audience is the group of partially-sighted soccer fans wearing headphones who are going crazy for their team just a few tiers ahead of him . one of these supporters , markus simmon , is a long-time fan of the cologne club .
visually-impaired , simmon 's experience of his team 's matches has drastically improved in the last year thanks to the service provided for the club and the descriptive words of wolfgang gommersbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this service with the earphones and reporters has been in place since the second half of the 2004 season .
" before that , we would have to sit with a companion in the stadium , feeling the atmosphere but relying on comments from a friend , " says simmon . a feast of soccer for the ears thankfully , things are a lot different now , and with the world cup on its way to germany in 2006 , blind and partially-sighted fans will be able to enjoy the action in detail in stadiums around the country as more clubs roll out the service . " here , from the first minute to the last , you can see the whole game , " simmon enthuses , referring to the ' seeing with the ears ' principle the service promotes .
" you can hear some of the players , shouts from the field and crowd , the ball being kicked , the spectators and the reporter .
you get angry , you get happy , you jump around and you cheer . " whether it 's keeping up to date with all the action on the field or any announcements or changes that appear on the scoreboard , the visually-impaired fans get the full effect and atmosphere of match day tailored to their disability .
the specific nature of the service means that commentators are specially trained in their approach and delivery to make the commentary as informative as possible without taking anything for granted . all the action as it happens via headphones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in previous radio reports , only a few minutes of the action were reported , " says gommersbach .
also , a lot of the commentary available mixed facts and figures with match action , an approach which partially-sighted spectators found disorientating and led to missed incidents on the field .
" in this service , we really present what is happening on the pitch . " the commentary is only one of the services afforded to the blind and visually-impaired .
tickets range from just 5 to 6 euros -lrb- $ 6.40 - $ 7.60 -rrb- a game , hot and cold drinks are provided and wet and cold weather gear is also available if needed .
clubs offer around 15 places in their visually-impaired areas , but at the moment it 's rare for them to be sold out , such is the lack of publicity for the service .

human rights groups have however warned the chancellor not to play down putin 's policies in chechnya . amid tight security , russian premier vladimir putin and german chancellor gerhard schröder jointly opened the hanover industrial trade fair , the largest of its kind in the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.04.2005 the sound of soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special commentary can make the game come alive for blind fans being blind or partially-sighted is no longer a barrier to enjoying the visual spectacle of soccer .
many german clubs are now providing a special commentary service at stadiums for spectators with visual impairments . can the blind watch soccer ?
the answer is obviously " no " if one talks about using the eyes , but thanks to a special service in operation in a number of soccer stadiums in germany and elsewhere , the partially-sighted can enjoy everything a live game has to offer by watching with their ears . wolfgang gommersbach is a commentator at fc cologne 's rheinenergie stadium .
his job is to present the play-by-play action of the second division bundesliga outfit 's home games to his avid listeners . but gommersbach 's commentary is not destined for the wider airwaves .
in fact , the 26-year-old can see his listeners from his place in the stands .
his audience is the group of partially-sighted soccer fans wearing headphones who are going crazy for their team just a few tiers ahead of him . one of these supporters , markus simmon , is a long-time fan of the cologne club .
visually-impaired , simmon 's experience of his team 's matches has drastically improved in the last year thanks to the service provided for the club and the descriptive words of wolfgang gommersbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this service with the earphones and reporters has been in place since the second half of the 2004 season .
" before that , we would have to sit with a companion in the stadium , feeling the atmosphere but relying on comments from a friend , " says simmon . a feast of soccer for the ears thankfully , things are a lot different now , and with the world cup on its way to germany in 2006 , blind and partially-sighted fans will be able to enjoy the action in detail in stadiums around the country as more clubs roll out the service . " here , from the first minute to the last , you can see the whole game , " simmon enthuses , referring to the ' seeing with the ears ' principle the service promotes .
" you can hear some of the players , shouts from the field and crowd , the ball being kicked , the spectators and the reporter .
you get angry , you get happy , you jump around and you cheer . " whether it 's keeping up to date with all the action on the field or any announcements or changes that appear on the scoreboard , the visually-impaired fans get the full effect and atmosphere of match day tailored to their disability .
the specific nature of the service means that commentators are specially trained in their approach and delivery to make the commentary as informative as possible without taking anything for granted . all the action as it happens via headphones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in previous radio reports , only a few minutes of the action were reported , " says gommersbach .
also , a lot of the commentary available mixed facts and figures with match action , an approach which partially-sighted spectators found disorientating and led to missed incidents on the field .
" in this service , we really present what is happening on the pitch . " the commentary is only one of the services afforded to the blind and visually-impaired .
tickets range from just 5 to 6 euros -lrb- $ 6.40 - $ 7.60 -rrb- a game , hot and cold drinks are provided and wet and cold weather gear is also available if needed .
clubs offer around 15 places in their visually-impaired areas , but at the moment it 's rare for them to be sold out , such is the lack of publicity for the service .
but things could well change as more clubs adopt the technology which has been in germany for around six years . leverkusen lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium , home to bayer 04 leverkusen .
bundesliga club bayer leverkusen was the first to offer the listening service to its blind fans after seeing it pioneered by manchester united .
" we first saw the system five or six years ago in england and former club president kurt vossen then brought the idea to bayer leverkusen , " stephan rem , head of sports relations at the club explained .
" we brought in specialists in the technology and security to work on the visually-impaired compound and the whole thing then moved relatively fast . " since then , clubs such as schalke 04 , hamburg sv and vfl wolfsburg have adopted the system , while bayer leverkusen has worked to improving the service .
in the future , it is expected that all newly constructed stadiums , like bayern munich 's new allianz arena , will include the system . a world cup for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future looks , and sounds , good for blind spectators .
it is entirely possible that the world cup in 2006 will provide the launch pad for an explosion in partially-sighted spectators attending games , especially if those who visit german stadiums for the tournament get a view of world class soccer - through the ears , of course . alexandra jarecka -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making the internet visible for the blind researchers at germany 's fraunhofer institute are providing companies and government agencies with fast and free tips to make their web pages more accessible to those who are blind or live with other disabilities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.04.2005 the sound of soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special commentary can make the game come alive for blind fans being blind or partially-sighted is no longer a barrier to enjoying the visual spectacle of soccer .
many german clubs are now providing a special commentary service at stadiums for spectators with visual impairments . can the blind watch soccer ?
the answer is obviously " no " if one talks about using the eyes , but thanks to a special service in operation in a number of soccer stadiums in germany and elsewhere , the partially-sighted can enjoy everything a live game has to offer by watching with their ears . wolfgang gommersbach is a commentator at fc cologne 's rheinenergie stadium .
his job is to present the play-by-play action of the second division bundesliga outfit 's home games to his avid listeners . but gommersbach 's commentary is not destined for the wider airwaves .
in fact , the 26-year-old can see his listeners from his place in the stands .
his audience is the group of partially-sighted soccer fans wearing headphones who are going crazy for their team just a few tiers ahead of him . one of these supporters , markus simmon , is a long-time fan of the cologne club .
visually-impaired , simmon 's experience of his team 's matches has drastically improved in the last year thanks to the service provided for the club and the descriptive words of wolfgang gommersbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this service with the earphones and reporters has been in place since the second half of the 2004 season .
" before that , we would have to sit with a companion in the stadium , feeling the atmosphere but relying on comments from a friend , " says simmon . a feast of soccer for the ears thankfully , things are a lot different now , and with the world cup on its way to germany in 2006 , blind and partially-sighted fans will be able to enjoy the action in detail in stadiums around the country as more clubs roll out the service . " here , from the first minute to the last , you can see the whole game , " simmon enthuses , referring to the ' seeing with the ears ' principle the service promotes .
" you can hear some of the players , shouts from the field and crowd , the ball being kicked , the spectators and the reporter .
you get angry , you get happy , you jump around and you cheer . " whether it 's keeping up to date with all the action on the field or any announcements or changes that appear on the scoreboard , the visually-impaired fans get the full effect and atmosphere of match day tailored to their disability .
the specific nature of the service means that commentators are specially trained in their approach and delivery to make the commentary as informative as possible without taking anything for granted . all the action as it happens via headphones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in previous radio reports , only a few minutes of the action were reported , " says gommersbach .
also , a lot of the commentary available mixed facts and figures with match action , an approach which partially-sighted spectators found disorientating and led to missed incidents on the field .
" in this service , we really present what is happening on the pitch . " the commentary is only one of the services afforded to the blind and visually-impaired .
tickets range from just 5 to 6 euros -lrb- $ 6.40 - $ 7.60 -rrb- a game , hot and cold drinks are provided and wet and cold weather gear is also available if needed .
clubs offer around 15 places in their visually-impaired areas , but at the moment it 's rare for them to be sold out , such is the lack of publicity for the service .
but things could well change as more clubs adopt the technology which has been in germany for around six years . leverkusen lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium , home to bayer 04 leverkusen .
bundesliga club bayer leverkusen was the first to offer the listening service to its blind fans after seeing it pioneered by manchester united .
" we first saw the system five or six years ago in england and former club president kurt vossen then brought the idea to bayer leverkusen , " stephan rem , head of sports relations at the club explained .
" we brought in specialists in the technology and security to work on the visually-impaired compound and the whole thing then moved relatively fast . " since then , clubs such as schalke 04 , hamburg sv and vfl wolfsburg have adopted the system , while bayer leverkusen has worked to improving the service .
in the future , it is expected that all newly constructed stadiums , like bayern munich 's new allianz arena , will include the system . a world cup for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future looks , and sounds , good for blind spectators .
it is entirely possible that the world cup in 2006 will provide the launch pad for an explosion in partially-sighted spectators attending games , especially if those who visit german stadiums for the tournament get a view of world class soccer - through the ears , of course . alexandra jarecka -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making the internet visible for the blind researchers at germany 's fraunhofer institute are providing companies and government agencies with fast and free tips to make their web pages more accessible to those who are blind or live with other disabilities .

though there were no gas chambers at the camp , prisoners were subjected to extreme cold and starvation .
" the camp was packed , there was hunger , and the living conditions and hygiene were unbelievable , " kohn told associated press . prisoners at the camp were forced to build roads and railways to assist the nazi war machine . scientists plundered some of the dead prisoners ' bodies for research purposes .
more than 56,000 people were murdered there between 1937 and 1945 .
on april 11 , 1945 , us troops reached the camp and freed around 21,000 prisoners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.04.2005 the sound of soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special commentary can make the game come alive for blind fans being blind or partially-sighted is no longer a barrier to enjoying the visual spectacle of soccer .
many german clubs are now providing a special commentary service at stadiums for spectators with visual impairments . can the blind watch soccer ?
the answer is obviously " no " if one talks about using the eyes , but thanks to a special service in operation in a number of soccer stadiums in germany and elsewhere , the partially-sighted can enjoy everything a live game has to offer by watching with their ears . wolfgang gommersbach is a commentator at fc cologne 's rheinenergie stadium .
his job is to present the play-by-play action of the second division bundesliga outfit 's home games to his avid listeners . but gommersbach 's commentary is not destined for the wider airwaves .
in fact , the 26-year-old can see his listeners from his place in the stands .
his audience is the group of partially-sighted soccer fans wearing headphones who are going crazy for their team just a few tiers ahead of him . one of these supporters , markus simmon , is a long-time fan of the cologne club .
visually-impaired , simmon 's experience of his team 's matches has drastically improved in the last year thanks to the service provided for the club and the descriptive words of wolfgang gommersbach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this service with the earphones and reporters has been in place since the second half of the 2004 season .
" before that , we would have to sit with a companion in the stadium , feeling the atmosphere but relying on comments from a friend , " says simmon . a feast of soccer for the ears thankfully , things are a lot different now , and with the world cup on its way to germany in 2006 , blind and partially-sighted fans will be able to enjoy the action in detail in stadiums around the country as more clubs roll out the service . " here , from the first minute to the last , you can see the whole game , " simmon enthuses , referring to the ' seeing with the ears ' principle the service promotes .
" you can hear some of the players , shouts from the field and crowd , the ball being kicked , the spectators and the reporter .
you get angry , you get happy , you jump around and you cheer . " whether it 's keeping up to date with all the action on the field or any announcements or changes that appear on the scoreboard , the visually-impaired fans get the full effect and atmosphere of match day tailored to their disability .
the specific nature of the service means that commentators are specially trained in their approach and delivery to make the commentary as informative as possible without taking anything for granted . all the action as it happens via headphones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in previous radio reports , only a few minutes of the action were reported , " says gommersbach .
also , a lot of the commentary available mixed facts and figures with match action , an approach which partially-sighted spectators found disorientating and led to missed incidents on the field .
" in this service , we really present what is happening on the pitch . " the commentary is only one of the services afforded to the blind and visually-impaired .
tickets range from just 5 to 6 euros -lrb- $ 6.40 - $ 7.60 -rrb- a game , hot and cold drinks are provided and wet and cold weather gear is also available if needed .
clubs offer around 15 places in their visually-impaired areas , but at the moment it 's rare for them to be sold out , such is the lack of publicity for the service .
but things could well change as more clubs adopt the technology which has been in germany for around six years . leverkusen lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium , home to bayer 04 leverkusen .
bundesliga club bayer leverkusen was the first to offer the listening service to its blind fans after seeing it pioneered by manchester united .
" we first saw the system five or six years ago in england and former club president kurt vossen then brought the idea to bayer leverkusen , " stephan rem , head of sports relations at the club explained .
" we brought in specialists in the technology and security to work on the visually-impaired compound and the whole thing then moved relatively fast . " since then , clubs such as schalke 04 , hamburg sv and vfl wolfsburg have adopted the system , while bayer leverkusen has worked to improving the service .
in the future , it is expected that all newly constructed stadiums , like bayern munich 's new allianz arena , will include the system . a world cup for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future looks , and sounds , good for blind spectators .
it is entirely possible that the world cup in 2006 will provide the launch pad for an explosion in partially-sighted spectators attending games , especially if those who visit german stadiums for the tournament get a view of world class soccer - through the ears , of course . alexandra jarecka -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making the internet visible for the blind researchers at germany 's fraunhofer institute are providing companies and government agencies with fast and free tips to make their web pages more accessible to those who are blind or live with other disabilities .

the show is also hoped to boost germany 's floundering economy and provide a fresh impetus to the key industry of machine manufacturing .
" i am looking forward to our meeting in hanover which will undoubtedly lead to the further development of the russian-german partnership , " putin told schröder by telephone this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president wladimir putin , left with german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder maintains a close friendship with putin , and recently underlined the importance of ensuring russia is involved in europe 's planning .

" these values must always be defended anew , " the chancellor said . " the death of millions , the suffering of the survivors , the torment of the victims - this is the basis of our task to create a better future , " he said .
" we can not change history , but this country can learn a lot from the deepest shame of our history .

though there were no gas chambers at the camp , prisoners were subjected to extreme cold and starvation .
" the camp was packed , there was hunger , and the living conditions and hygiene were unbelievable , " kohn told associated press . prisoners at the camp were forced to build roads and railways to assist the nazi war machine . scientists plundered some of the dead prisoners ' bodies for research purposes .
more than 56,000 people were murdered there between 1937 and 1945 .
on april 11 , 1945 , us troops reached the camp and freed around 21,000 prisoners .

astronomers have been hailing the plans , as a european project to build an extremely large telescope -lrb- elt -rrb- enters a design testing phase .
an elt is vital if the pace of astronomical breakthroughs is to continue , say experts .
the plans were outlined at the uk national astronomy meeting in birmingham .
concepts for elts include the thirty meter telescope -lrb- tmt -rrb- being considered by the us and canada ; and the euro50 and overwhelmingly large telescope -lrb- owl -rrb- proposals put forward by europe .
the size of any european telescope has not yet been set .
but the european southern observatory 's owl concept could be by far the largest telescope ever built , with a spherical primary mirror that could stretch up to 100m across .
the diameter of a telescope is its key performance characteristic , because larger mirrors collect more light to concentrate in images .
elts would incorporate adaptive optics , a computer controlled system that deforms the mirror to adjust for the atmospheric turbulence that distorts light waves coming into the telescope .
detecting life one of the most exciting areas in which elts are certain to have a major impact is the search for earth-like planets and by extension extra-terrestrial life .
astronomers have already detected about 150 planets orbiting other stars using indirect methods , such as the so called " wobble effect " in which the presence of the target world is inferred from the gravitational influence it has on its parent star .
more recently , groups have released images which they claim show distant worlds in other solar systems directly .
many astronomers are unconvinced - but , even so , all of these exoplanets so far detected are unlikely to be much like our own .
what all these projects have in common is that you ca n't build a mirror bigger than about 8m across in one piece dr isobel hook , elt " the candidate exoplanets which we have images for are probably going to be young , giant planets which are nothing like what we have in the solar system , " said dr isobel hook , an elt project scientist from the university of oxford , uk .
" if you want to be able to study a mature planet which is not emitting its own light anymore , you need to cope with a much larger contrast between the bright star and the faint planet .
" for that , you need a much bigger telescope , " she told the bbc news website .
multi-part mirrors elts could study the chemical composition of earth-like planets , detecting the presence of liquid water , oxygen or methane .
telescopes this powerful might even be able to detect vegetation on a distant planet , by looking at a characteristic spectral signature from chlorophyll , the key pigment involved in photosynthesis .
the " quantum leap " in performance possible with elts will also help astronomers gain a better understanding of galaxies and when their stars formed , and answer the many outstanding questions about the nature of mysterious dark matter and dark energy - which forms 95 % of the known universe .
the scale of the projects means they have to be collaborative but building these gargantuan observatories poses significant technical challenges .
" what all these projects have in common is that you ca n't build a mirror bigger than about 8m across in one piece , " said dr hook .
" if you want to make something bigger than that , you have to make it from smaller pieces . "
some elt designs involve combining several circular 8m-wide mirrors .
but others , like the owl and the euro-50 , will have mirrors constructed from many small hexagonal segments .
the owl design uses a spherical , rather than the usual parabolic , mirror shape to cut down on cost .
this means its segments can be the same shape and size and can be mass-produced .
but this also means the telescope 's field does not have a focus , so the owl requires several corrective mirrors .
the owl concept works for a telescope of around 100m , but below the 60m mark , the euro-50 design - with its smaller parabolic mirror - may strike a better deal between cost and performance .
the design study which is currently underway will determine which of these concepts europe should go with .
