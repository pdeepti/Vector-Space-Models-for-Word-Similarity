" there has n't been a coherent wall concept so far , just remains of the wall scattered over the city - a double row of cobblestones in some places to mark the former border and a few disparate signs and plaques on the wall victims , ” dominique krüssen of the berlin senate for culture told dw-world last year .
" it probably was a mistake to tear it down to such a large extent in the early 1990s . " expanding official memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin visitors look through the wall at bernauer strasse on aug .
13 . , 2002 , the 41st anniversary of the building of the berlin wall .
flierl 's plan foresees building upon the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , the scene of several escape attempts during the cold war .
at present , about 70 meters of the former border strip have been bracketed off into two seven-meter high steel walls .
visitors can peer through slits in the hinterland wall into the empty death strip . however , the bernauer strasse memorial remains largely ignored by the hordes of daily tourists who prefer to flock to the more commercially-successful checkpoint charlie - the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin 's most famous cold war symbol . flierl hopes to change that by injecting some authenticity into the rather bleak landscape by transporting some further real pieces of the wall to the area . " no hollywood-like rebuilding " in addition , his plan envisions using the remains of the front and secondary wall scattered around on the scruffy parks in the area between the bernauer strasse , the nordbahnhof railway station and the mauerpark and combining it with some multimedia features such as video bus tours and electronic audio guides to give visitors a real feel of the horrors of the death strip . however flierl made clear that a " a hollywood-like rebuilding of the wall as a trivialized theme park " was definitely not on the cards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men read the letters , names of victims of the berlin-wall , of wooden crosses , standing next to a re-erected strip of the former berlin wall near checkpoint charlie in berlin on oct .
31 , 2004 .
the comment was directed at the controversial rebuilding of the wall at checkpoint charlie and a memorial with wooden crosses in memory of the wall victims erected by alexandra hildebrandt , head of the checkpoint charlie museum . the berlin senate for culture has been wrangling with hildebrandt for months over the controversial exhibit .
a local court has now ordered its removal .
flierl 's latest plans include erecting an " information pavilion " on the area . historians slam plan however , flierl 's plans , in particular his refusal to reconstruct old watch towers and security barriers near the bernauer strasse , also triggered criticism on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the august 17 , 1962 photo shows dying peter fechter carried away by east german border guards who shot him down when he tried to flee to the west .
klaus-dieter henke , historian at the university of dresden said the blueprint hardly mentioned the political actors who " deprived the people of freedom through cement and guns . " manfred wilke , head of the research group on the communist regime at berlin 's free university said the plan utterly lacked shedding light on the perpetrators and the historical context . " the words ' fleeing from the gdr ' does n't make an appearance in the paper at all , " wilke said .
" but , that 's what the people associate with the wall . " question mark over finances others have more immediate concerns .
alice ströver , the education expert of the local green party warned that the undertaking could end in naught if it 's too ambitious to start with and involves too many memorials at disparate sites . most importantly , there 's no mention as yet of what the whole project would cost and where the money will come - not an unimportant matter in a broke city . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trivializing the wall as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.04.2005 crisis deepens over french eu stance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' non ' camp is gaining strength even as french voters look set to torpedo the eu constitution in a referendum , luxembourg premier juncker added a new twist to the dilemma this week , saying the us hopes the french will reject the treaty . " i do n't think that people in the us and the anglo-saxon countries would be unsatisfied with a french rejection , " juncker , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said in an interview on french radio . " that would in fact correspond with their idea of europe as one that 's weakened , because it would mean giving up the most noble of its ambitions for the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker is worried about the french referendum .
juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the us and other anglo-saxon countries had no sympathy for " the idea of a constitution , for this strengthening of europe , " and they did n't want europe as " a completely responsible and competent player " on the world stage . juncker 's comments come at a time of growing concern in france and elsewhere in on the continent that a french " non " to the treaty would effectively throw the entire european integration process into disarray . drawn up by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , the constitution is meant to simplify decision-making in the european union but it must first be adopted by all 25 member states . six weeks before the planned french referendum on may 29 , opinion polls show 55 percent support for ' no ' with 45 percent backing the document . vote sparks infighting in government inside france , rejecting the constitution would gravely undermine the standing of president jacques chirac 's government .
but it would also set off a bitter internal war among the socialists , whose leadership is campaigning in favor of the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac during his television appearance in an attempt to lobby support for the eu constitution hopes that chirac could revitalize the fortunes of the ' yes ' camp in a two-hour appearance before a group of 80 young people have come to nothing .
chirac said during the television debate on thursday that he will not personally resign if the constitution is rejected by the electorate , but the dismissal of a prime minister is the standard way for a french president to extricate himself from political difficulties . on tuesday there were clear signals that prime minister jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- will lose his job if opponents of the text win the referendum .
tensions over the continuing failure of the government 's " yes " campaign spilled over at a weekly ministerial breakfast meeting with what officials described as a " very violent argument " between raffarin and interior minister dominique de villepin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- was reportedly furious about remarks made by villepin in a radio interview sunday that were openly critical of the way the government has handled the run-up to the may 29 vote and hinted at the prime minister 's approaching replacement . concerns in germany meanwhile , politicians in germany seemed alarmed at the consequences for europe of a french rejection . german interior minister otto schily warned that a french ' no ' would also be a serious setback for european home affairs and justice policies .
" i really hope that the french people can be successfully convinced that they would be making a serious mistake if this referendum fails , " schily said tuesday in berlin . germany will not hold a referendum on the constitution but will put it to a vote before parliament .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , is set to ratify the treaty on may 12 - ahead of the french referendum - to give its neighbor a boost .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is expected to rubber-stamp it a few weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer , however , put a brave face on the french crisis on monday . " i firmly believe that france , despite the current opinion polls , will vote ' yes ' , " he told handelsblatt business daily .
fischer said that france 's approval of the first eu constitution was crucial as " the founding nation of the european union . " the green party politician said the only alternative to allowing the treaty to come into force would be to revert to the 2000 treaty of nice , which eu leaders have described as a recipe for deadlock in an expanding bloc . " it is an illusion to think one could reopen the constitutional package and renegotiate it .
there will not be a better eu constitution in the foreseeable future , " fischer said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french ' yes ' referendum camp fights back french president jacques chirac is leading an offensive to convince reluctant french voters of the merits of the eu constitution .

their basic technology is said to have been invented in germany , but it was companies elsewhere in the world that profited the most from selling them . focusing on opportunities in a bid to jumpstart german competitiveness , the german chancellor called on business and political leaders to show more courage when reaching out for tomorrow 's opportunities . " nobody says we should ignore risks , " he said .
" but it would be equally misplaced to become engrossed in constant analysis of what could go wrong and how could we minimize the effects .

" if politics becomes involved in science , innovation is bound to suffer .
politicians tend to support only those projects which have already garnered much publicity and some public prominence . " merkel 's criticism concerns a research project into gene-spliced plants for which funding was stopped recently by the government .

a recent genetic engineering law passed by the red-green government coalition , she said , was clearly meant to prevent innovation in agriculture rather than foster this technology . heinrich oberreuther , a political scientist , said party strategies towards an innovative economy could become a vote winner in germany .

their basic technology is said to have been invented in germany , but it was companies elsewhere in the world that profited the most from selling them . focusing on opportunities in a bid to jumpstart german competitiveness , the german chancellor called on business and political leaders to show more courage when reaching out for tomorrow 's opportunities . " nobody says we should ignore risks , " he said .
" but it would be equally misplaced to become engrossed in constant analysis of what could go wrong and how could we minimize the effects .
we need a culture that focuses first and foremost on the opportunities , without , of course , letting the risks totally slip from view . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking at the opening of a nationwide campaign to promote up and coming young scientists , the chancellor highlighted a new government package of measures worth 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- , that was aimed at supporting universities and elite research centers in their bid to create innovative technologies and products . he also promised 140 million euros in state support for innovative start-up businesses , and demanded more funding from germany ’ s federal states for improvements in general education . opposition concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservative opposition on monday also devoted a symposium to innovation in germany .
cdu leader angela merkel criticized the schröder government for what she called its heavy-handed interference in the freedom of science and research . " we must make sure that research projects are only evaluated by researchers , " merkel said .
" if politics becomes involved in science , innovation is bound to suffer .
politicians tend to support only those projects which have already garnered much publicity and some public prominence . " merkel 's criticism concerns a research project into gene-spliced plants for which funding was stopped recently by the government .

the system is intended to replace patriot missiles in the united states and germany , and nike hercules missiles in italy . but for green party chief reinhard bütikofer , there are still some reservations with regard to the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer " it was n't easy at all for us , " bütikofer said in berlin on monday , adding that his party , with its deeply pacifist roots , had decided to reluctantly throw their weight behind it after considering the project in its entirety .
at the same time he said his party continued to have misgivings about the concrete military need for the project as well as the costs involved . reservations remain the us , germany and italy are funding meads in shares of 58 percent , 25 percent and 17 percent respectively .
for germany alone , this amounts to 886 million euros -lrb- $ 1,154 million -rrb- over a period of eight years .
more costs could follow . germany ’ s greens are worried that the costs involved in the missile defense project could balloon out of control .
but despite their concerns , green party leaders have decided that they do not want to risk a dispute within the coalition government .
that 's why they 've recommended that the green parliamentary group vote in favor of germany 's involvement in the project . chancellor schröder 's ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are happy with this development .
spd party chair franz münterfering is now reassured ahead of parliament 's budgetary committee meeting later this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering münterfering said he expects wednesday 's vote to be in favor of the meads project . " it is also a question of germany 's reliability , " he said .
" we never had any doubt that this should be possible , and we are pleased that we can now come to this decision . " reliability at stake the need for germany to be seen as reliable by its ally , the united states , was one of the social democrats ’ primary arguments for supporting the meads project – which is the largest transatlantic missile defense system .
the greens seem to have accepted this argument , but by way of compromise they are insisting that other defense costs be reduced . on tuesday , the greens are expected to signal their support for the meads project within the bundestag lower house of parliament .

you might when you hear that at least he 's unlikely to stray .
a new study has revealed that overweight men are more likely to remain faithful to their partners . when german health institute epicure questioned some 1,000 men between 31 and 69 about their sexuality , it discovered that one in five men fantasizes about having an affair .
but the heavier he gets , the less likely he is to fancy a fling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so despite his obvious advantages , a man with six-pack abs does have his flaws . the impotence issue " the more you weigh , the less you 'll feel like sexual dalliances , " said sascha rusch from epicure . but do fat men just have fewer opportunities for hanky panky , or is their sex drive really lower ?
apparently so .
seven percent of men enjoy sex with prostitutes , in comparison to just four percent of overweight men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low self-confidence is partly to blame , but rusch pointed out that the main reason is more likely to be lack of exercise and bad diet . " only 44 percent of men believe in eating healthily , " he said .
" but there 's an immediate connection between obesity and impotence . " social standing if even getting up off the couch seems like an effort , bedroom frolics are probably the last thing on a man 's mind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the study also showed that 75 percent of men are willing to tackle lack of energy with regular sport - even if they do n't necessarily do so for the benefit of their better halves .
four of five men said they lead a healthy lifestyle in order to live longer and feel better , 55 per cent of them say they hope personal fitness will improve their self-confidence , while only 27 percent of the respondents said they worked out in order to appear more attractive . " ego tends to be the main motivation , " rusch said . even so , the older a man is , the more he earns and the better his education , the more effort he 'll put in to pleasing his partner . whatever the reasons , we now know that fat men are faithful .
but the inevitable question is : are their partners faithful to them ? dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans do n't do low-carb while the latest diet craze makes its way through the us , germans continue chomping down on bread and potatoes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.04.2005 giving globalization a coy voice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " have you ever fallen in love with a voice on the telephone ? "
what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?
a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . " " have you ever lied on the phone or used a false name ? " - the unexpected question asked huskily in an indian accent over my headphones stops me in my tracks .
i 'm on a walking tour called " call cutta , " through an unfamiliar and desolate stretch of berlin 's usually vibrant kreuzberg neighborhood .
after renting a hands-free mobile set from the local hebbel theater and waiting for a call , i 'm now following instructions provided via the phone by a flirtatious guide calling himself ' bruce . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin .
for the past hour , he 's navigated me through buildings , parks , playgrounds , cellars and courtyards , fed me intriguing scraps of information on the history of the area and teased out some rather personal details . but , as i consider his latest question , i suspect bruce does it all the time .
after all , he 's never set eyes on the landscape he 's been meticulously steering me through .
what 's more , ' bruce ' is n't even his real name .
in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .
the artists were inspired by salt lake city , a booming district of glass buildings housing call centers on the outskirts of the city .
" it was a total contrast to everything else in calcutta , " said daniel wetzel , one of the artists in the group .
" it was also surreal .
suddenly the west with its money and capitalism was here and the people sitting in these buildings were pretending to be a part of it - it provided the perfect stage setting . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " call cutta " performers in calcutta much like siemens and other german companies who have rushed to india to take advantage of low labor costs , the artists ' outsourced ' the " call cutta " project : they hired ten people in calcutta , some of them fluent in german , set them up in a glitzy call center and trained them in a basic script detailing routes and landmarks in a neighborhood in calcutta and in berlin .
naturally indian the rest of the performance was pretty much left up to them .
" there are clear limits in a call center .
we wanted to get away from that and allow the operators to improvise and bring in their own voices , " said wetzel .
" theater is all about the senses .
in this case the feeling that you 're talking to a real person is important even though it 's from a great distance . "
thus , unlike the operators in india 's booming call centers who dub themselves " john " and " sara " and adopt british and american accents to disguise their origin and put their customers in the west at ease , the calcutta call center performers sound unabashedly indian and human as they guide , flirt , play-act and even sing their way around on the tour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin david xavier -lrb- his real name -rrb- , who steers people through the northern calcutta neighborhood of hatibagan in the afternoon and through kreuzberg in the evening , said it 's all a matter of being imaginative .
" the reaction from walkers , whether in berlin or calcutta , is overwhelmingly positive , " the 39-year-old said .
" they 're surprised at the different perspectives the tour can open up about their own cities . "
more than a telephone connection there 's another twist to the surprise and weirdness of the tour - the artists have woven in the history of colonial india 's struggle for independence from the british into the kreuzberg district where the " call cutta " tour is set .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose thus , obediently following bruce 's instructions and feeling like i 'm on a treasure hunt , i get down on my hands and knees next to a dustbin in a park and peer underneath it to find a faded picture of subhas chandra bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a famous freedom fighter from bengal .
bose spent time between 1941 and 1943 in berlin trying to recruit hitler 's help in fighting the british .
apparently his office and the radio station " free india " he set up were once in this area . further along , to the amusement of a gaggle of neighborhood children trailing me by now , i 'm led to another hidden photograph of a striking young indian soldier , one of the many thousands who belonged to bose 's " free india " army and which was incorporated into hitler 's until the end of the second world war .
connecting across the miles slightly overwhelmed by the intensity and busyness of the encounter but looking at my surroundings with new eyes , i come to the end of the tour in a shiny mall at potsdamer platz to finally see ' bruce ' waving at me from a small screen in the window of a consumer electronics store .

"
what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?
a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . " " have you ever lied on the phone or used a false name ? " - the unexpected question asked huskily in an indian accent over my headphones stops me in my tracks .
i 'm on a walking tour called " call cutta , " through an unfamiliar and desolate stretch of berlin 's usually vibrant kreuzberg neighborhood .
after renting a hands-free mobile set from the local hebbel theater and waiting for a call , i 'm now following instructions provided via the phone by a flirtatious guide calling himself ' bruce . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin .
for the past hour , he 's navigated me through buildings , parks , playgrounds , cellars and courtyards , fed me intriguing scraps of information on the history of the area and teased out some rather personal details . but , as i consider his latest question , i suspect bruce does it all the time .
after all , he 's never set eyes on the landscape he 's been meticulously steering me through .
what 's more , ' bruce ' is n't even his real name .
in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .
the artists were inspired by salt lake city , a booming district of glass buildings housing call centers on the outskirts of the city .
" it was a total contrast to everything else in calcutta , " said daniel wetzel , one of the artists in the group .
" it was also surreal .
suddenly the west with its money and capitalism was here and the people sitting in these buildings were pretending to be a part of it - it provided the perfect stage setting . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " call cutta " performers in calcutta much like siemens and other german companies who have rushed to india to take advantage of low labor costs , the artists ' outsourced ' the " call cutta " project : they hired ten people in calcutta , some of them fluent in german , set them up in a glitzy call center and trained them in a basic script detailing routes and landmarks in a neighborhood in calcutta and in berlin .
naturally indian the rest of the performance was pretty much left up to them .
" there are clear limits in a call center .
we wanted to get away from that and allow the operators to improvise and bring in their own voices , " said wetzel .
" theater is all about the senses .
in this case the feeling that you 're talking to a real person is important even though it 's from a great distance . "
thus , unlike the operators in india 's booming call centers who dub themselves " john " and " sara " and adopt british and american accents to disguise their origin and put their customers in the west at ease , the calcutta call center performers sound unabashedly indian and human as they guide , flirt , play-act and even sing their way around on the tour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin david xavier -lrb- his real name -rrb- , who steers people through the northern calcutta neighborhood of hatibagan in the afternoon and through kreuzberg in the evening , said it 's all a matter of being imaginative .
" the reaction from walkers , whether in berlin or calcutta , is overwhelmingly positive , " the 39-year-old said .
" they 're surprised at the different perspectives the tour can open up about their own cities . "
more than a telephone connection there 's another twist to the surprise and weirdness of the tour - the artists have woven in the history of colonial india 's struggle for independence from the british into the kreuzberg district where the " call cutta " tour is set .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose thus , obediently following bruce 's instructions and feeling like i 'm on a treasure hunt , i get down on my hands and knees next to a dustbin in a park and peer underneath it to find a faded picture of subhas chandra bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a famous freedom fighter from bengal .
bose spent time between 1941 and 1943 in berlin trying to recruit hitler 's help in fighting the british .
apparently his office and the radio station " free india " he set up were once in this area . further along , to the amusement of a gaggle of neighborhood children trailing me by now , i 'm led to another hidden photograph of a striking young indian soldier , one of the many thousands who belonged to bose 's " free india " army and which was incorporated into hitler 's until the end of the second world war .
connecting across the miles slightly overwhelmed by the intensity and busyness of the encounter but looking at my surroundings with new eyes , i come to the end of the tour in a shiny mall at potsdamer platz to finally see ' bruce ' waving at me from a small screen in the window of a consumer electronics store .
according to the artists , the prime goal of the project , despite occasional hitches like the phone connection being lost , is communication .
" people here might know a lot about india and the call center boom , " said wetzel .
" but all that knowledge does n't help in countering unfair clichés if you 've never really spoken to or had a real exchange with an indian . "

"
what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?
a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . " " have you ever lied on the phone or used a false name ? " - the unexpected question asked huskily in an indian accent over my headphones stops me in my tracks .
i 'm on a walking tour called " call cutta , " through an unfamiliar and desolate stretch of berlin 's usually vibrant kreuzberg neighborhood .
after renting a hands-free mobile set from the local hebbel theater and waiting for a call , i 'm now following instructions provided via the phone by a flirtatious guide calling himself ' bruce . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin .
for the past hour , he 's navigated me through buildings , parks , playgrounds , cellars and courtyards , fed me intriguing scraps of information on the history of the area and teased out some rather personal details . but , as i consider his latest question , i suspect bruce does it all the time .
after all , he 's never set eyes on the landscape he 's been meticulously steering me through .
what 's more , ' bruce ' is n't even his real name .
in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .
the artists were inspired by salt lake city , a booming district of glass buildings housing call centers on the outskirts of the city .
" it was a total contrast to everything else in calcutta , " said daniel wetzel , one of the artists in the group .
" it was also surreal .
suddenly the west with its money and capitalism was here and the people sitting in these buildings were pretending to be a part of it - it provided the perfect stage setting . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " call cutta " performers in calcutta much like siemens and other german companies who have rushed to india to take advantage of low labor costs , the artists ' outsourced ' the " call cutta " project : they hired ten people in calcutta , some of them fluent in german , set them up in a glitzy call center and trained them in a basic script detailing routes and landmarks in a neighborhood in calcutta and in berlin .
naturally indian the rest of the performance was pretty much left up to them .
" there are clear limits in a call center .
we wanted to get away from that and allow the operators to improvise and bring in their own voices , " said wetzel .
" theater is all about the senses .
in this case the feeling that you 're talking to a real person is important even though it 's from a great distance . "
thus , unlike the operators in india 's booming call centers who dub themselves " john " and " sara " and adopt british and american accents to disguise their origin and put their customers in the west at ease , the calcutta call center performers sound unabashedly indian and human as they guide , flirt , play-act and even sing their way around on the tour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin david xavier -lrb- his real name -rrb- , who steers people through the northern calcutta neighborhood of hatibagan in the afternoon and through kreuzberg in the evening , said it 's all a matter of being imaginative .
" the reaction from walkers , whether in berlin or calcutta , is overwhelmingly positive , " the 39-year-old said .
" they 're surprised at the different perspectives the tour can open up about their own cities . "
more than a telephone connection there 's another twist to the surprise and weirdness of the tour - the artists have woven in the history of colonial india 's struggle for independence from the british into the kreuzberg district where the " call cutta " tour is set .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose thus , obediently following bruce 's instructions and feeling like i 'm on a treasure hunt , i get down on my hands and knees next to a dustbin in a park and peer underneath it to find a faded picture of subhas chandra bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a famous freedom fighter from bengal .
bose spent time between 1941 and 1943 in berlin trying to recruit hitler 's help in fighting the british .
apparently his office and the radio station " free india " he set up were once in this area . further along , to the amusement of a gaggle of neighborhood children trailing me by now , i 'm led to another hidden photograph of a striking young indian soldier , one of the many thousands who belonged to bose 's " free india " army and which was incorporated into hitler 's until the end of the second world war .
connecting across the miles slightly overwhelmed by the intensity and busyness of the encounter but looking at my surroundings with new eyes , i come to the end of the tour in a shiny mall at potsdamer platz to finally see ' bruce ' waving at me from a small screen in the window of a consumer electronics store .
according to the artists , the prime goal of the project , despite occasional hitches like the phone connection being lost , is communication .
" people here might know a lot about india and the call center boom , " said wetzel .
" but all that knowledge does n't help in countering unfair clichés if you 've never really spoken to or had a real exchange with an indian . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists need n't worry about that .
mark stuver , 30 , from san francisco , who was in berlin for the first time and did the tour with ' dawn , ' admitted he 'd exchanged phone numbers with her . " it was a bit crazy being guided in berlin all the way from india , " said stuver .

the system is intended to replace patriot missiles in the united states and germany , and nike hercules missiles in italy . but for green party chief reinhard bütikofer , there are still some reservations with regard to the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer " it was n't easy at all for us , " bütikofer said in berlin on monday , adding that his party , with its deeply pacifist roots , had decided to reluctantly throw their weight behind it after considering the project in its entirety .
at the same time he said his party continued to have misgivings about the concrete military need for the project as well as the costs involved . reservations remain the us , germany and italy are funding meads in shares of 58 percent , 25 percent and 17 percent respectively .
for germany alone , this amounts to 886 million euros -lrb- $ 1,154 million -rrb- over a period of eight years .
more costs could follow . germany ’ s greens are worried that the costs involved in the missile defense project could balloon out of control .
but despite their concerns , green party leaders have decided that they do not want to risk a dispute within the coalition government .
that 's why they 've recommended that the green parliamentary group vote in favor of germany 's involvement in the project . chancellor schröder 's ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are happy with this development .
spd party chair franz münterfering is now reassured ahead of parliament 's budgetary committee meeting later this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering münterfering said he expects wednesday 's vote to be in favor of the meads project . " it is also a question of germany 's reliability , " he said .
" we never had any doubt that this should be possible , and we are pleased that we can now come to this decision . " reliability at stake the need for germany to be seen as reliable by its ally , the united states , was one of the social democrats ’ primary arguments for supporting the meads project – which is the largest transatlantic missile defense system .
the greens seem to have accepted this argument , but by way of compromise they are insisting that other defense costs be reduced . on tuesday , the greens are expected to signal their support for the meads project within the bundestag lower house of parliament .
when the budgetary committee gives its approval as expected on wednesday , the german government can finally confirm its long-awaited participation in the transatlantic defense system . nina werkhäuser -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meads defense system in the firing line ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 germany 's media struggle with migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's missing in germany is an awareness of every-day migrant life even though some 7.3 million foreigners currently live in germany , migrant life still gets a bad rap in the media .
public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches . if german television is anything to go by , muslim life is still shackled by tradition and overshadowed by crime .
its image took an even steeper downward plunge after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , said fritz pleitgen , director of german public broadcaster wdr . but migrant life is n't all bad news , he insisted - and it 's high time television delivered the broader picture . melting pot germany " honor killings and arranged marriages make more of a splash in the media that differentiated depictions of normal life among migrants , " pleitgen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asli bayram was crowned miss germany 2005 he 'd rather see more coverage of upbeat news about the country 's minorities - like german-turkish director fatih akin winning the golden bear at the berlin film festival and asli bayram -lrb- photo -rrb- scooping this year 's miss germany title . after all , contemporary germany is increasing becoming a proverbial melting pot .
cultural borders have never been more blurred - one in six marriages is inter-cultural and one in four children born in germany has at least one non-german parent . remaining objective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the other hand , gang violence , honor killings and the sort of muslim fundamentalism practiced , for example , by the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who is now standing trial in istanbul after germany extradited him last year , are also a fact of modern life . but it needs to be stressed that these cases are exceptions , said marie-luise beck , a government expert on migration .
at a time when economic problems are creating wide-scale insecurity and resentment , society tends to look for scape-goats , she observed . " it 's important to report on what 's happening , " she said .
" the media has a duty to cover an inflammatory speech given by an imam .
but it 's equally important to report of the rise of right-wing extremism and show that it does n't only take the form of jackboots , it can also come packaged in a pin-stripe suit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an approach that can easily depoliticize extremism .
beck said that instead of exploring the roots of right-wing fanaticism , the media tends to promote a stereotypical image of shaven-headed nazis in bomber jackets which fails to convey the full extent of the problem - and the rise of middle-class reactionaries . beate winkler from the european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia also had reservations about the way the media portrays right-wing extremism . " right-wing extremists are turned into victims to such an extent that viewers can identify with them , " she said .
" at the same time no one really looks at their broader social role . " " why ca n't we take them as they are ? " so what can be done to encourage more objective reporting ?
while many feel that germany 's public broadcasters should assume an educational responsibility by depicting positive examples of integration , others caution against taking an over-optimistic approach . " people are always saying television should show more good news , " said ulrich deppendorf from wdr .
" but if we only ever showed positive images , we 'd lost some of our credibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to media expert rainer braun , the problem is that migrants still have n't hit the mainstream . " why is it so hard to have people from other backgrounds fronting any thing other than specifically multi-cultural shows ? " he asked .

you might when you hear that at least he 's unlikely to stray .
a new study has revealed that overweight men are more likely to remain faithful to their partners . when german health institute epicure questioned some 1,000 men between 31 and 69 about their sexuality , it discovered that one in five men fantasizes about having an affair .
but the heavier he gets , the less likely he is to fancy a fling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so despite his obvious advantages , a man with six-pack abs does have his flaws . the impotence issue " the more you weigh , the less you 'll feel like sexual dalliances , " said sascha rusch from epicure . but do fat men just have fewer opportunities for hanky panky , or is their sex drive really lower ?
apparently so .
seven percent of men enjoy sex with prostitutes , in comparison to just four percent of overweight men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low self-confidence is partly to blame , but rusch pointed out that the main reason is more likely to be lack of exercise and bad diet . " only 44 percent of men believe in eating healthily , " he said .
" but there 's an immediate connection between obesity and impotence . " social standing if even getting up off the couch seems like an effort , bedroom frolics are probably the last thing on a man 's mind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the study also showed that 75 percent of men are willing to tackle lack of energy with regular sport - even if they do n't necessarily do so for the benefit of their better halves .
four of five men said they lead a healthy lifestyle in order to live longer and feel better , 55 per cent of them say they hope personal fitness will improve their self-confidence , while only 27 percent of the respondents said they worked out in order to appear more attractive . " ego tends to be the main motivation , " rusch said . even so , the older a man is , the more he earns and the better his education , the more effort he 'll put in to pleasing his partner . whatever the reasons , we now know that fat men are faithful .

" i do n't think that people in the us and the anglo-saxon countries would be unsatisfied with a french rejection , " juncker , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said in an interview on french radio . " that would in fact correspond with their idea of europe as one that 's weakened , because it would mean giving up the most noble of its ambitions for the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker is worried about the french referendum .
juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the us and other anglo-saxon countries had no sympathy for " the idea of a constitution , for this strengthening of europe , " and they did n't want europe as " a completely responsible and competent player " on the world stage . juncker 's comments come at a time of growing concern in france and elsewhere in on the continent that a french " non " to the treaty would effectively throw the entire european integration process into disarray . drawn up by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , the constitution is meant to simplify decision-making in the european union but it must first be adopted by all 25 member states . six weeks before the planned french referendum on may 29 , opinion polls show 55 percent support for ' no ' with 45 percent backing the document . vote sparks infighting in government inside france , rejecting the constitution would gravely undermine the standing of president jacques chirac 's government .
but it would also set off a bitter internal war among the socialists , whose leadership is campaigning in favor of the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac during his television appearance in an attempt to lobby support for the eu constitution hopes that chirac could revitalize the fortunes of the ' yes ' camp in a two-hour appearance before a group of 80 young people have come to nothing .
chirac said during the television debate on thursday that he will not personally resign if the constitution is rejected by the electorate , but the dismissal of a prime minister is the standard way for a french president to extricate himself from political difficulties . on tuesday there were clear signals that prime minister jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- will lose his job if opponents of the text win the referendum .
tensions over the continuing failure of the government 's " yes " campaign spilled over at a weekly ministerial breakfast meeting with what officials described as a " very violent argument " between raffarin and interior minister dominique de villepin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- was reportedly furious about remarks made by villepin in a radio interview sunday that were openly critical of the way the government has handled the run-up to the may 29 vote and hinted at the prime minister 's approaching replacement . concerns in germany meanwhile , politicians in germany seemed alarmed at the consequences for europe of a french rejection . german interior minister otto schily warned that a french ' no ' would also be a serious setback for european home affairs and justice policies .
" i really hope that the french people can be successfully convinced that they would be making a serious mistake if this referendum fails , " schily said tuesday in berlin . germany will not hold a referendum on the constitution but will put it to a vote before parliament .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , is set to ratify the treaty on may 12 - ahead of the french referendum - to give its neighbor a boost .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is expected to rubber-stamp it a few weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer , however , put a brave face on the french crisis on monday . " i firmly believe that france , despite the current opinion polls , will vote ' yes ' , " he told handelsblatt business daily .
fischer said that france 's approval of the first eu constitution was crucial as " the founding nation of the european union . " the green party politician said the only alternative to allowing the treaty to come into force would be to revert to the 2000 treaty of nice , which eu leaders have described as a recipe for deadlock in an expanding bloc . " it is an illusion to think one could reopen the constitutional package and renegotiate it .

" there has n't been a coherent wall concept so far , just remains of the wall scattered over the city - a double row of cobblestones in some places to mark the former border and a few disparate signs and plaques on the wall victims , ” dominique krüssen of the berlin senate for culture told dw-world last year .
" it probably was a mistake to tear it down to such a large extent in the early 1990s . " expanding official memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin visitors look through the wall at bernauer strasse on aug .
13 . , 2002 , the 41st anniversary of the building of the berlin wall .
flierl 's plan foresees building upon the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , the scene of several escape attempts during the cold war .
at present , about 70 meters of the former border strip have been bracketed off into two seven-meter high steel walls .
visitors can peer through slits in the hinterland wall into the empty death strip . however , the bernauer strasse memorial remains largely ignored by the hordes of daily tourists who prefer to flock to the more commercially-successful checkpoint charlie - the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin 's most famous cold war symbol . flierl hopes to change that by injecting some authenticity into the rather bleak landscape by transporting some further real pieces of the wall to the area . " no hollywood-like rebuilding " in addition , his plan envisions using the remains of the front and secondary wall scattered around on the scruffy parks in the area between the bernauer strasse , the nordbahnhof railway station and the mauerpark and combining it with some multimedia features such as video bus tours and electronic audio guides to give visitors a real feel of the horrors of the death strip . however flierl made clear that a " a hollywood-like rebuilding of the wall as a trivialized theme park " was definitely not on the cards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men read the letters , names of victims of the berlin-wall , of wooden crosses , standing next to a re-erected strip of the former berlin wall near checkpoint charlie in berlin on oct .
31 , 2004 .
the comment was directed at the controversial rebuilding of the wall at checkpoint charlie and a memorial with wooden crosses in memory of the wall victims erected by alexandra hildebrandt , head of the checkpoint charlie museum . the berlin senate for culture has been wrangling with hildebrandt for months over the controversial exhibit .
a local court has now ordered its removal .
flierl 's latest plans include erecting an " information pavilion " on the area . historians slam plan however , flierl 's plans , in particular his refusal to reconstruct old watch towers and security barriers near the bernauer strasse , also triggered criticism on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the august 17 , 1962 photo shows dying peter fechter carried away by east german border guards who shot him down when he tried to flee to the west .
klaus-dieter henke , historian at the university of dresden said the blueprint hardly mentioned the political actors who " deprived the people of freedom through cement and guns . " manfred wilke , head of the research group on the communist regime at berlin 's free university said the plan utterly lacked shedding light on the perpetrators and the historical context . " the words ' fleeing from the gdr ' does n't make an appearance in the paper at all , " wilke said .
" but , that 's what the people associate with the wall . " question mark over finances others have more immediate concerns .
alice ströver , the education expert of the local green party warned that the undertaking could end in naught if it 's too ambitious to start with and involves too many memorials at disparate sites . most importantly , there 's no mention as yet of what the whole project would cost and where the money will come - not an unimportant matter in a broke city . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trivializing the wall as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie .

you might when you hear that at least he 's unlikely to stray .
a new study has revealed that overweight men are more likely to remain faithful to their partners . when german health institute epicure questioned some 1,000 men between 31 and 69 about their sexuality , it discovered that one in five men fantasizes about having an affair .
but the heavier he gets , the less likely he is to fancy a fling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so despite his obvious advantages , a man with six-pack abs does have his flaws . the impotence issue " the more you weigh , the less you 'll feel like sexual dalliances , " said sascha rusch from epicure . but do fat men just have fewer opportunities for hanky panky , or is their sex drive really lower ?
apparently so .
seven percent of men enjoy sex with prostitutes , in comparison to just four percent of overweight men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low self-confidence is partly to blame , but rusch pointed out that the main reason is more likely to be lack of exercise and bad diet . " only 44 percent of men believe in eating healthily , " he said .
" but there 's an immediate connection between obesity and impotence . " social standing if even getting up off the couch seems like an effort , bedroom frolics are probably the last thing on a man 's mind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the study also showed that 75 percent of men are willing to tackle lack of energy with regular sport - even if they do n't necessarily do so for the benefit of their better halves .
four of five men said they lead a healthy lifestyle in order to live longer and feel better , 55 per cent of them say they hope personal fitness will improve their self-confidence , while only 27 percent of the respondents said they worked out in order to appear more attractive . " ego tends to be the main motivation , " rusch said . even so , the older a man is , the more he earns and the better his education , the more effort he 'll put in to pleasing his partner . whatever the reasons , we now know that fat men are faithful .
but the inevitable question is : are their partners faithful to them ? dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans do n't do low-carb while the latest diet craze makes its way through the us , germans continue chomping down on bread and potatoes .

" right-wing extremists are turned into victims to such an extent that viewers can identify with them , " she said .

" that a compatriot has become pope fills us in germany with special pleasure and also a little pride , " he said in berlin .

" the cardinal was always john paul ii 's right hand and surely contributed much to the opening gaining this priority , " chairman nadeem elyas said in aachen , according to dpa .
as germans , muslims were doubly happy about ratzinger 's election , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor hubert gschwendtner of marktl am inn residents of marktl am inn , where ratzinger was born 78 years ago , were ebullient .

" we consider ratzinger 's election a catastrophe .
i think that the current church 's course is only confirmed by this college of cardinals , " he said , adding that he did n't expect any reforms under pope benedict xvi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 germany 's media struggle with migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's missing in germany is an awareness of every-day migrant life even though some 7.3 million foreigners currently live in germany , migrant life still gets a bad rap in the media .
public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches . if german television is anything to go by , muslim life is still shackled by tradition and overshadowed by crime .
its image took an even steeper downward plunge after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , said fritz pleitgen , director of german public broadcaster wdr . but migrant life is n't all bad news , he insisted - and it 's high time television delivered the broader picture . melting pot germany " honor killings and arranged marriages make more of a splash in the media that differentiated depictions of normal life among migrants , " pleitgen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asli bayram was crowned miss germany 2005 he 'd rather see more coverage of upbeat news about the country 's minorities - like german-turkish director fatih akin winning the golden bear at the berlin film festival and asli bayram -lrb- photo -rrb- scooping this year 's miss germany title . after all , contemporary germany is increasing becoming a proverbial melting pot .
cultural borders have never been more blurred - one in six marriages is inter-cultural and one in four children born in germany has at least one non-german parent . remaining objective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the other hand , gang violence , honor killings and the sort of muslim fundamentalism practiced , for example , by the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who is now standing trial in istanbul after germany extradited him last year , are also a fact of modern life . but it needs to be stressed that these cases are exceptions , said marie-luise beck , a government expert on migration .
at a time when economic problems are creating wide-scale insecurity and resentment , society tends to look for scape-goats , she observed . " it 's important to report on what 's happening , " she said .
" the media has a duty to cover an inflammatory speech given by an imam .
but it 's equally important to report of the rise of right-wing extremism and show that it does n't only take the form of jackboots , it can also come packaged in a pin-stripe suit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an approach that can easily depoliticize extremism .
beck said that instead of exploring the roots of right-wing fanaticism , the media tends to promote a stereotypical image of shaven-headed nazis in bomber jackets which fails to convey the full extent of the problem - and the rise of middle-class reactionaries . beate winkler from the european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia also had reservations about the way the media portrays right-wing extremism . " right-wing extremists are turned into victims to such an extent that viewers can identify with them , " she said .
" at the same time no one really looks at their broader social role . " " why ca n't we take them as they are ? " so what can be done to encourage more objective reporting ?
while many feel that germany 's public broadcasters should assume an educational responsibility by depicting positive examples of integration , others caution against taking an over-optimistic approach . " people are always saying television should show more good news , " said ulrich deppendorf from wdr .
" but if we only ever showed positive images , we 'd lost some of our credibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to media expert rainer braun , the problem is that migrants still have n't hit the mainstream . " why is it so hard to have people from other backgrounds fronting any thing other than specifically multi-cultural shows ? " he asked .
" why could n't they read the prime-time news or host political shows - why ca n't we just take them as they are ?

public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches . if german television is anything to go by , muslim life is still shackled by tradition and overshadowed by crime .
its image took an even steeper downward plunge after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , said fritz pleitgen , director of german public broadcaster wdr . but migrant life is n't all bad news , he insisted - and it 's high time television delivered the broader picture . melting pot germany " honor killings and arranged marriages make more of a splash in the media that differentiated depictions of normal life among migrants , " pleitgen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asli bayram was crowned miss germany 2005 he 'd rather see more coverage of upbeat news about the country 's minorities - like german-turkish director fatih akin winning the golden bear at the berlin film festival and asli bayram -lrb- photo -rrb- scooping this year 's miss germany title . after all , contemporary germany is increasing becoming a proverbial melting pot .

at a time when economic problems are creating wide-scale insecurity and resentment , society tends to look for scape-goats , she observed . " it 's important to report on what 's happening , " she said .
" the media has a duty to cover an inflammatory speech given by an imam .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an approach that can easily depoliticize extremism .
beck said that instead of exploring the roots of right-wing fanaticism , the media tends to promote a stereotypical image of shaven-headed nazis in bomber jackets which fails to convey the full extent of the problem - and the rise of middle-class reactionaries . beate winkler from the european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia also had reservations about the way the media portrays right-wing extremism . " right-wing extremists are turned into victims to such an extent that viewers can identify with them , " she said .
" at the same time no one really looks at their broader social role . " " why ca n't we take them as they are ? " so what can be done to encourage more objective reporting ?
while many feel that germany 's public broadcasters should assume an educational responsibility by depicting positive examples of integration , others caution against taking an over-optimistic approach .

bavarian cardinal joseph ratzinger became the 265th pope . germany 's joseph ratzinger was elected pope for the world 's one billion catholics on tuesday evening .
he chose the name benedict xvi .
the new pontiff briefly addressed the hundreds of thousands of catholics gathered at st. peter 's square from a balcony on st. peter 's basilica .
" dear brothers and sisters , after the great pope john paul ii the cardinals have elected me a simple and humble laborer in the vineyard of the lord , " he said , paying tribute to his predecessor .

the two shared similar conservative views against women in the church , abortion and pregnancy counseling centers .
he once called abortion a " culture of death . "
ratzinger also squabbled with three german cardinals in 1994 about divorcees being allowed to marry again in the church .
bildunterschrift : tourists wave the vatican and german flags as they celebrate in st. peter 's square at the vatican following the election of the new pope german politicians lined up to praise the new pope , the first from germany in over 480 years .
" i congratulate him heartily in the name of the german government and all the citizens of his home country germany , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said . at 78 , experts consider him a " transition pope " who wo n't hold the title as long as his predecessor john paul ii , who was pope for 26 years .

" i congratulate him in the name of the government and all the citizens of his home country , " german chancellor schröder said in berlin on tuesday . german president horst köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed similar sentiments .
" that a compatriot has become pope fills us in germany with special pleasure and also a little pride , " he said in berlin .
" i 'm convinced that pope benedict xvi will continue the late pope john paul ii 's great engagement for people 's dignity and peace in the world , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler german opposition leader angela merkel , head of the christian democrats , called the election " historical . "
" that a german was elected pope is a moment of pride .
it 's an honor . "
bavarian state premier edmund stoiber of the christian socialist union said it was a " historic and singular day for bavaria and all of germany .
religious understanding bishop wolfgang huber of germany 's protestant church said he hoped that pope benedict xvi would continue cooperation between the christian churches .
the churchs ' futures lay only in ecumenical efforts , he said , as the german bishops ' conference congratulated ratzinger .

" the cardinal was always john paul ii 's right hand and surely contributed much to the opening gaining this priority , " chairman nadeem elyas said in aachen , according to dpa .
as germans , muslims were doubly happy about ratzinger 's election , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor hubert gschwendtner of marktl am inn residents of marktl am inn , where ratzinger was born 78 years ago , were ebullient .

he would be the first pope to visit marktl .
no reform expected but others in germany were n't enthusiastic .

" we consider ratzinger 's election a catastrophe .
i think that the current church 's course is only confirmed by this college of cardinals , " he said , adding that he did n't expect any reforms under pope benedict xvi .

" and theologian hans küng , another catholic critic forbidden by the vatican from teaching and a former school colleague of ratzinger called the choice a " huge disappointment " for all those focused on reform , though he said the new pope , ' like a us president " should be accorded 100 days to learn his new job . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's joseph ratzinger elected pope after initial uncertainty , white smoke rose from the chimney of the sistine chapel indicating the election of a new pope , the church 's 265th .

"
what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?
a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . " " have you ever lied on the phone or used a false name ? " - the unexpected question asked huskily in an indian accent over my headphones stops me in my tracks .
i 'm on a walking tour called " call cutta , " through an unfamiliar and desolate stretch of berlin 's usually vibrant kreuzberg neighborhood .
after renting a hands-free mobile set from the local hebbel theater and waiting for a call , i 'm now following instructions provided via the phone by a flirtatious guide calling himself ' bruce . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin .
for the past hour , he 's navigated me through buildings , parks , playgrounds , cellars and courtyards , fed me intriguing scraps of information on the history of the area and teased out some rather personal details . but , as i consider his latest question , i suspect bruce does it all the time .
after all , he 's never set eyes on the landscape he 's been meticulously steering me through .
what 's more , ' bruce ' is n't even his real name .
in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .
the artists were inspired by salt lake city , a booming district of glass buildings housing call centers on the outskirts of the city .
" it was a total contrast to everything else in calcutta , " said daniel wetzel , one of the artists in the group .
" it was also surreal .
suddenly the west with its money and capitalism was here and the people sitting in these buildings were pretending to be a part of it - it provided the perfect stage setting . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " call cutta " performers in calcutta much like siemens and other german companies who have rushed to india to take advantage of low labor costs , the artists ' outsourced ' the " call cutta " project : they hired ten people in calcutta , some of them fluent in german , set them up in a glitzy call center and trained them in a basic script detailing routes and landmarks in a neighborhood in calcutta and in berlin .
naturally indian the rest of the performance was pretty much left up to them .
" there are clear limits in a call center .
we wanted to get away from that and allow the operators to improvise and bring in their own voices , " said wetzel .
" theater is all about the senses .
in this case the feeling that you 're talking to a real person is important even though it 's from a great distance . "
thus , unlike the operators in india 's booming call centers who dub themselves " john " and " sara " and adopt british and american accents to disguise their origin and put their customers in the west at ease , the calcutta call center performers sound unabashedly indian and human as they guide , flirt , play-act and even sing their way around on the tour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin david xavier -lrb- his real name -rrb- , who steers people through the northern calcutta neighborhood of hatibagan in the afternoon and through kreuzberg in the evening , said it 's all a matter of being imaginative .
" the reaction from walkers , whether in berlin or calcutta , is overwhelmingly positive , " the 39-year-old said .
" they 're surprised at the different perspectives the tour can open up about their own cities . "
more than a telephone connection there 's another twist to the surprise and weirdness of the tour - the artists have woven in the history of colonial india 's struggle for independence from the british into the kreuzberg district where the " call cutta " tour is set .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose thus , obediently following bruce 's instructions and feeling like i 'm on a treasure hunt , i get down on my hands and knees next to a dustbin in a park and peer underneath it to find a faded picture of subhas chandra bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a famous freedom fighter from bengal .
bose spent time between 1941 and 1943 in berlin trying to recruit hitler 's help in fighting the british .
apparently his office and the radio station " free india " he set up were once in this area . further along , to the amusement of a gaggle of neighborhood children trailing me by now , i 'm led to another hidden photograph of a striking young indian soldier , one of the many thousands who belonged to bose 's " free india " army and which was incorporated into hitler 's until the end of the second world war .
connecting across the miles slightly overwhelmed by the intensity and busyness of the encounter but looking at my surroundings with new eyes , i come to the end of the tour in a shiny mall at potsdamer platz to finally see ' bruce ' waving at me from a small screen in the window of a consumer electronics store .
according to the artists , the prime goal of the project , despite occasional hitches like the phone connection being lost , is communication .
" people here might know a lot about india and the call center boom , " said wetzel .
" but all that knowledge does n't help in countering unfair clichés if you 've never really spoken to or had a real exchange with an indian . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists need n't worry about that .
mark stuver , 30 , from san francisco , who was in berlin for the first time and did the tour with ' dawn , ' admitted he 'd exchanged phone numbers with her . " it was a bit crazy being guided in berlin all the way from india , " said stuver .
" but , though we were thousands of miles apart , we still connected . "

"
what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?
a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . " " have you ever lied on the phone or used a false name ? " - the unexpected question asked huskily in an indian accent over my headphones stops me in my tracks .
i 'm on a walking tour called " call cutta , " through an unfamiliar and desolate stretch of berlin 's usually vibrant kreuzberg neighborhood .
after renting a hands-free mobile set from the local hebbel theater and waiting for a call , i 'm now following instructions provided via the phone by a flirtatious guide calling himself ' bruce . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin .
for the past hour , he 's navigated me through buildings , parks , playgrounds , cellars and courtyards , fed me intriguing scraps of information on the history of the area and teased out some rather personal details . but , as i consider his latest question , i suspect bruce does it all the time .
after all , he 's never set eyes on the landscape he 's been meticulously steering me through .
what 's more , ' bruce ' is n't even his real name .
in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .
the artists were inspired by salt lake city , a booming district of glass buildings housing call centers on the outskirts of the city .
" it was a total contrast to everything else in calcutta , " said daniel wetzel , one of the artists in the group .
" it was also surreal .
suddenly the west with its money and capitalism was here and the people sitting in these buildings were pretending to be a part of it - it provided the perfect stage setting . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " call cutta " performers in calcutta much like siemens and other german companies who have rushed to india to take advantage of low labor costs , the artists ' outsourced ' the " call cutta " project : they hired ten people in calcutta , some of them fluent in german , set them up in a glitzy call center and trained them in a basic script detailing routes and landmarks in a neighborhood in calcutta and in berlin .
naturally indian the rest of the performance was pretty much left up to them .
" there are clear limits in a call center .
we wanted to get away from that and allow the operators to improvise and bring in their own voices , " said wetzel .
" theater is all about the senses .
in this case the feeling that you 're talking to a real person is important even though it 's from a great distance . "
thus , unlike the operators in india 's booming call centers who dub themselves " john " and " sara " and adopt british and american accents to disguise their origin and put their customers in the west at ease , the calcutta call center performers sound unabashedly indian and human as they guide , flirt , play-act and even sing their way around on the tour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin david xavier -lrb- his real name -rrb- , who steers people through the northern calcutta neighborhood of hatibagan in the afternoon and through kreuzberg in the evening , said it 's all a matter of being imaginative .
" the reaction from walkers , whether in berlin or calcutta , is overwhelmingly positive , " the 39-year-old said .
" they 're surprised at the different perspectives the tour can open up about their own cities . "
more than a telephone connection there 's another twist to the surprise and weirdness of the tour - the artists have woven in the history of colonial india 's struggle for independence from the british into the kreuzberg district where the " call cutta " tour is set .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose thus , obediently following bruce 's instructions and feeling like i 'm on a treasure hunt , i get down on my hands and knees next to a dustbin in a park and peer underneath it to find a faded picture of subhas chandra bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a famous freedom fighter from bengal .
bose spent time between 1941 and 1943 in berlin trying to recruit hitler 's help in fighting the british .
apparently his office and the radio station " free india " he set up were once in this area . further along , to the amusement of a gaggle of neighborhood children trailing me by now , i 'm led to another hidden photograph of a striking young indian soldier , one of the many thousands who belonged to bose 's " free india " army and which was incorporated into hitler 's until the end of the second world war .
connecting across the miles slightly overwhelmed by the intensity and busyness of the encounter but looking at my surroundings with new eyes , i come to the end of the tour in a shiny mall at potsdamer platz to finally see ' bruce ' waving at me from a small screen in the window of a consumer electronics store .
according to the artists , the prime goal of the project , despite occasional hitches like the phone connection being lost , is communication .
" people here might know a lot about india and the call center boom , " said wetzel .
" but all that knowledge does n't help in countering unfair clichés if you 've never really spoken to or had a real exchange with an indian . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists need n't worry about that .
mark stuver , 30 , from san francisco , who was in berlin for the first time and did the tour with ' dawn , ' admitted he 'd exchanged phone numbers with her . " it was a bit crazy being guided in berlin all the way from india , " said stuver .

" it was a total contrast to everything else in calcutta , " said daniel wetzel , one of the artists in the group .
" it was also surreal .
suddenly the west with its money and capitalism was here and the people sitting in these buildings were pretending to be a part of it - it provided the perfect stage setting . "

naturally indian the rest of the performance was pretty much left up to them .
" there are clear limits in a call center .
we wanted to get away from that and allow the operators to improvise and bring in their own voices , " said wetzel .
" theater is all about the senses .
in this case the feeling that you 're talking to a real person is important even though it 's from a great distance . "
thus , unlike the operators in india 's booming call centers who dub themselves " john " and " sara " and adopt british and american accents to disguise their origin and put their customers in the west at ease , the calcutta call center performers sound unabashedly indian and human as they guide , flirt , play-act and even sing their way around on the tour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin david xavier -lrb- his real name -rrb- , who steers people through the northern calcutta neighborhood of hatibagan in the afternoon and through kreuzberg in the evening , said it 's all a matter of being imaginative .
" the reaction from walkers , whether in berlin or calcutta , is overwhelmingly positive , " the 39-year-old said .
" they 're surprised at the different perspectives the tour can open up about their own cities . "
more than a telephone connection there 's another twist to the surprise and weirdness of the tour - the artists have woven in the history of colonial india 's struggle for independence from the british into the kreuzberg district where the " call cutta " tour is set .

bose spent time between 1941 and 1943 in berlin trying to recruit hitler 's help in fighting the british .
apparently his office and the radio station " free india " he set up were once in this area . further along , to the amusement of a gaggle of neighborhood children trailing me by now , i 'm led to another hidden photograph of a striking young indian soldier , one of the many thousands who belonged to bose 's " free india " army and which was incorporated into hitler 's until the end of the second world war .

according to the artists , the prime goal of the project , despite occasional hitches like the phone connection being lost , is communication .
" people here might know a lot about india and the call center boom , " said wetzel .
" but all that knowledge does n't help in countering unfair clichés if you 've never really spoken to or had a real exchange with an indian . "

"
what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?
a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . " " have you ever lied on the phone or used a false name ? " - the unexpected question asked huskily in an indian accent over my headphones stops me in my tracks .
i 'm on a walking tour called " call cutta , " through an unfamiliar and desolate stretch of berlin 's usually vibrant kreuzberg neighborhood .
after renting a hands-free mobile set from the local hebbel theater and waiting for a call , i 'm now following instructions provided via the phone by a flirtatious guide calling himself ' bruce . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin .
for the past hour , he 's navigated me through buildings , parks , playgrounds , cellars and courtyards , fed me intriguing scraps of information on the history of the area and teased out some rather personal details . but , as i consider his latest question , i suspect bruce does it all the time .
after all , he 's never set eyes on the landscape he 's been meticulously steering me through .
what 's more , ' bruce ' is n't even his real name .
in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .

the system is intended to replace patriot missiles in the united states and germany , and nike hercules missiles in italy . but for green party chief reinhard bütikofer , there are still some reservations with regard to the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer " it was n't easy at all for us , " bütikofer said in berlin on monday , adding that his party , with its deeply pacifist roots , had decided to reluctantly throw their weight behind it after considering the project in its entirety .
at the same time he said his party continued to have misgivings about the concrete military need for the project as well as the costs involved . reservations remain the us , germany and italy are funding meads in shares of 58 percent , 25 percent and 17 percent respectively .
for germany alone , this amounts to 886 million euros -lrb- $ 1,154 million -rrb- over a period of eight years .
more costs could follow . germany ’ s greens are worried that the costs involved in the missile defense project could balloon out of control .
but despite their concerns , green party leaders have decided that they do not want to risk a dispute within the coalition government .
that 's why they 've recommended that the green parliamentary group vote in favor of germany 's involvement in the project . chancellor schröder 's ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are happy with this development .
spd party chair franz münterfering is now reassured ahead of parliament 's budgetary committee meeting later this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering münterfering said he expects wednesday 's vote to be in favor of the meads project . " it is also a question of germany 's reliability , " he said .
" we never had any doubt that this should be possible , and we are pleased that we can now come to this decision . " reliability at stake the need for germany to be seen as reliable by its ally , the united states , was one of the social democrats ’ primary arguments for supporting the meads project – which is the largest transatlantic missile defense system .
the greens seem to have accepted this argument , but by way of compromise they are insisting that other defense costs be reduced . on tuesday , the greens are expected to signal their support for the meads project within the bundestag lower house of parliament .
when the budgetary committee gives its approval as expected on wednesday , the german government can finally confirm its long-awaited participation in the transatlantic defense system . nina werkhäuser -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meads defense system in the firing line ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 german politicians push innovation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young scientists should n't hide their light under a bushel the need to promote innovation , research and development has become a key issue in german politics , with both government and opposition outlining plans to improve what has apparently become a weak point in the economy . on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder called on german businesses to be more courageous when turning inventions into marketable products . the fax machine , the mobile phone and modern flat-panel screens have become symbols of german research ingenuity - but also of the country 's inability to turn them into money-making products .
their basic technology is said to have been invented in germany , but it was companies elsewhere in the world that profited the most from selling them . focusing on opportunities in a bid to jumpstart german competitiveness , the german chancellor called on business and political leaders to show more courage when reaching out for tomorrow 's opportunities . " nobody says we should ignore risks , " he said .
" but it would be equally misplaced to become engrossed in constant analysis of what could go wrong and how could we minimize the effects .
we need a culture that focuses first and foremost on the opportunities , without , of course , letting the risks totally slip from view . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking at the opening of a nationwide campaign to promote up and coming young scientists , the chancellor highlighted a new government package of measures worth 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- , that was aimed at supporting universities and elite research centers in their bid to create innovative technologies and products . he also promised 140 million euros in state support for innovative start-up businesses , and demanded more funding from germany ’ s federal states for improvements in general education . opposition concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservative opposition on monday also devoted a symposium to innovation in germany .
cdu leader angela merkel criticized the schröder government for what she called its heavy-handed interference in the freedom of science and research . " we must make sure that research projects are only evaluated by researchers , " merkel said .
" if politics becomes involved in science , innovation is bound to suffer .
politicians tend to support only those projects which have already garnered much publicity and some public prominence . " merkel 's criticism concerns a research project into gene-spliced plants for which funding was stopped recently by the government .
merkel also accused germany 's green party of ideological bias with regard genetic engineering .
a recent genetic engineering law passed by the red-green government coalition , she said , was clearly meant to prevent innovation in agriculture rather than foster this technology . heinrich oberreuther , a political scientist , said party strategies towards an innovative economy could become a vote winner in germany . " a party that neglects this issue will cause major problems for germany as a whole , " he said .
" promoting innovation has become a matter of do or die for all political organizations . " low self-esteem and indeed , only about 11 percent of all germans believe that this country is still spearheading the drive for innovative products in the world . german pollster forsa published a survey on monday saying that 62 percent of people here think germany is now mediocre in the field of engineering and 25 percent believe standards have fallen below mediocre . but the forsa findings are thrown into a different light by a recent emnid report on " the image of germany abroad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sharp contrast to germany 's image of itself , the " made in germany " brand was given a high rating by the us , spain , england , france , sweden and poland . german companies do indeed enjoy greater profit growth than their us counterparts , and the country is an international market leader when it comes to innovative fields such as bio- and nanotechnology . if it wants to make lasting progress , germany will first have to overcome its inferiority complex . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reinventing german innovation a recent study into the " to be or not to be " of self-employment revealed a national reluctance among germans to go it alone .
but inventors are crying out for a chance to give the country a cutting-edge status . -lrb- feb .
1 , 2005 -rrb- german innovation stalled at home internet calling , the biggest innovation in communications since the invention of the telephone , was " made in germany . "

their basic technology is said to have been invented in germany , but it was companies elsewhere in the world that profited the most from selling them . focusing on opportunities in a bid to jumpstart german competitiveness , the german chancellor called on business and political leaders to show more courage when reaching out for tomorrow 's opportunities . " nobody says we should ignore risks , " he said .
" but it would be equally misplaced to become engrossed in constant analysis of what could go wrong and how could we minimize the effects .
we need a culture that focuses first and foremost on the opportunities , without , of course , letting the risks totally slip from view . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking at the opening of a nationwide campaign to promote up and coming young scientists , the chancellor highlighted a new government package of measures worth 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- , that was aimed at supporting universities and elite research centers in their bid to create innovative technologies and products . he also promised 140 million euros in state support for innovative start-up businesses , and demanded more funding from germany ’ s federal states for improvements in general education . opposition concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservative opposition on monday also devoted a symposium to innovation in germany .
cdu leader angela merkel criticized the schröder government for what she called its heavy-handed interference in the freedom of science and research . " we must make sure that research projects are only evaluated by researchers , " merkel said .
" if politics becomes involved in science , innovation is bound to suffer .
politicians tend to support only those projects which have already garnered much publicity and some public prominence . " merkel 's criticism concerns a research project into gene-spliced plants for which funding was stopped recently by the government .
merkel also accused germany 's green party of ideological bias with regard genetic engineering .
a recent genetic engineering law passed by the red-green government coalition , she said , was clearly meant to prevent innovation in agriculture rather than foster this technology . heinrich oberreuther , a political scientist , said party strategies towards an innovative economy could become a vote winner in germany .

you might when you hear that at least he 's unlikely to stray .
a new study has revealed that overweight men are more likely to remain faithful to their partners . when german health institute epicure questioned some 1,000 men between 31 and 69 about their sexuality , it discovered that one in five men fantasizes about having an affair .
but the heavier he gets , the less likely he is to fancy a fling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so despite his obvious advantages , a man with six-pack abs does have his flaws . the impotence issue " the more you weigh , the less you 'll feel like sexual dalliances , " said sascha rusch from epicure . but do fat men just have fewer opportunities for hanky panky , or is their sex drive really lower ?
apparently so .
seven percent of men enjoy sex with prostitutes , in comparison to just four percent of overweight men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low self-confidence is partly to blame , but rusch pointed out that the main reason is more likely to be lack of exercise and bad diet . " only 44 percent of men believe in eating healthily , " he said .
" but there 's an immediate connection between obesity and impotence . " social standing if even getting up off the couch seems like an effort , bedroom frolics are probably the last thing on a man 's mind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the study also showed that 75 percent of men are willing to tackle lack of energy with regular sport - even if they do n't necessarily do so for the benefit of their better halves .
four of five men said they lead a healthy lifestyle in order to live longer and feel better , 55 per cent of them say they hope personal fitness will improve their self-confidence , while only 27 percent of the respondents said they worked out in order to appear more attractive . " ego tends to be the main motivation , " rusch said . even so , the older a man is , the more he earns and the better his education , the more effort he 'll put in to pleasing his partner . whatever the reasons , we now know that fat men are faithful .
but the inevitable question is : are their partners faithful to them ? dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans do n't do low-carb while the latest diet craze makes its way through the us , germans continue chomping down on bread and potatoes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.04.2005 crisis deepens over french eu stance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' non ' camp is gaining strength even as french voters look set to torpedo the eu constitution in a referendum , luxembourg premier juncker added a new twist to the dilemma this week , saying the us hopes the french will reject the treaty . " i do n't think that people in the us and the anglo-saxon countries would be unsatisfied with a french rejection , " juncker , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said in an interview on french radio . " that would in fact correspond with their idea of europe as one that 's weakened , because it would mean giving up the most noble of its ambitions for the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker is worried about the french referendum .
juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the us and other anglo-saxon countries had no sympathy for " the idea of a constitution , for this strengthening of europe , " and they did n't want europe as " a completely responsible and competent player " on the world stage . juncker 's comments come at a time of growing concern in france and elsewhere in on the continent that a french " non " to the treaty would effectively throw the entire european integration process into disarray . drawn up by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , the constitution is meant to simplify decision-making in the european union but it must first be adopted by all 25 member states . six weeks before the planned french referendum on may 29 , opinion polls show 55 percent support for ' no ' with 45 percent backing the document . vote sparks infighting in government inside france , rejecting the constitution would gravely undermine the standing of president jacques chirac 's government .
but it would also set off a bitter internal war among the socialists , whose leadership is campaigning in favor of the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac during his television appearance in an attempt to lobby support for the eu constitution hopes that chirac could revitalize the fortunes of the ' yes ' camp in a two-hour appearance before a group of 80 young people have come to nothing .
chirac said during the television debate on thursday that he will not personally resign if the constitution is rejected by the electorate , but the dismissal of a prime minister is the standard way for a french president to extricate himself from political difficulties . on tuesday there were clear signals that prime minister jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- will lose his job if opponents of the text win the referendum .
tensions over the continuing failure of the government 's " yes " campaign spilled over at a weekly ministerial breakfast meeting with what officials described as a " very violent argument " between raffarin and interior minister dominique de villepin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- was reportedly furious about remarks made by villepin in a radio interview sunday that were openly critical of the way the government has handled the run-up to the may 29 vote and hinted at the prime minister 's approaching replacement . concerns in germany meanwhile , politicians in germany seemed alarmed at the consequences for europe of a french rejection . german interior minister otto schily warned that a french ' no ' would also be a serious setback for european home affairs and justice policies .
" i really hope that the french people can be successfully convinced that they would be making a serious mistake if this referendum fails , " schily said tuesday in berlin . germany will not hold a referendum on the constitution but will put it to a vote before parliament .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , is set to ratify the treaty on may 12 - ahead of the french referendum - to give its neighbor a boost .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is expected to rubber-stamp it a few weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer , however , put a brave face on the french crisis on monday . " i firmly believe that france , despite the current opinion polls , will vote ' yes ' , " he told handelsblatt business daily .
fischer said that france 's approval of the first eu constitution was crucial as " the founding nation of the european union . " the green party politician said the only alternative to allowing the treaty to come into force would be to revert to the 2000 treaty of nice , which eu leaders have described as a recipe for deadlock in an expanding bloc . " it is an illusion to think one could reopen the constitutional package and renegotiate it .
there will not be a better eu constitution in the foreseeable future , " fischer said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french ' yes ' referendum camp fights back french president jacques chirac is leading an offensive to convince reluctant french voters of the merits of the eu constitution .

" i do n't think that people in the us and the anglo-saxon countries would be unsatisfied with a french rejection , " juncker , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said in an interview on french radio .

juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the us and other anglo-saxon countries had no sympathy for " the idea of a constitution , for this strengthening of europe , " and they did n't want europe as " a completely responsible and competent player " on the world stage . juncker 's comments come at a time of growing concern in france and elsewhere in on the continent that a french " non " to the treaty would effectively throw the entire european integration process into disarray . drawn up by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , the constitution is meant to simplify decision-making in the european union but it must first be adopted by all 25 member states . six weeks before the planned french referendum on may 29 , opinion polls show 55 percent support for ' no ' with 45 percent backing the document . vote sparks infighting in government inside france , rejecting the constitution would gravely undermine the standing of president jacques chirac 's government .

chirac said during the television debate on thursday that he will not personally resign if the constitution is rejected by the electorate , but the dismissal of a prime minister is the standard way for a french president to extricate himself from political difficulties . on tuesday there were clear signals that prime minister jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- will lose his job if opponents of the text win the referendum .

their basic technology is said to have been invented in germany , but it was companies elsewhere in the world that profited the most from selling them . focusing on opportunities in a bid to jumpstart german competitiveness , the german chancellor called on business and political leaders to show more courage when reaching out for tomorrow 's opportunities . " nobody says we should ignore risks , " he said .
" but it would be equally misplaced to become engrossed in constant analysis of what could go wrong and how could we minimize the effects .
we need a culture that focuses first and foremost on the opportunities , without , of course , letting the risks totally slip from view . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking at the opening of a nationwide campaign to promote up and coming young scientists , the chancellor highlighted a new government package of measures worth 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- , that was aimed at supporting universities and elite research centers in their bid to create innovative technologies and products . he also promised 140 million euros in state support for innovative start-up businesses , and demanded more funding from germany ’ s federal states for improvements in general education . opposition concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservative opposition on monday also devoted a symposium to innovation in germany .
cdu leader angela merkel criticized the schröder government for what she called its heavy-handed interference in the freedom of science and research . " we must make sure that research projects are only evaluated by researchers , " merkel said .
" if politics becomes involved in science , innovation is bound to suffer .
politicians tend to support only those projects which have already garnered much publicity and some public prominence . " merkel 's criticism concerns a research project into gene-spliced plants for which funding was stopped recently by the government .
merkel also accused germany 's green party of ideological bias with regard genetic engineering .
a recent genetic engineering law passed by the red-green government coalition , she said , was clearly meant to prevent innovation in agriculture rather than foster this technology . heinrich oberreuther , a political scientist , said party strategies towards an innovative economy could become a vote winner in germany . " a party that neglects this issue will cause major problems for germany as a whole , " he said .
" promoting innovation has become a matter of do or die for all political organizations . " low self-esteem and indeed , only about 11 percent of all germans believe that this country is still spearheading the drive for innovative products in the world . german pollster forsa published a survey on monday saying that 62 percent of people here think germany is now mediocre in the field of engineering and 25 percent believe standards have fallen below mediocre . but the forsa findings are thrown into a different light by a recent emnid report on " the image of germany abroad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sharp contrast to germany 's image of itself , the " made in germany " brand was given a high rating by the us , spain , england , france , sweden and poland . german companies do indeed enjoy greater profit growth than their us counterparts , and the country is an international market leader when it comes to innovative fields such as bio- and nanotechnology . if it wants to make lasting progress , germany will first have to overcome its inferiority complex . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reinventing german innovation a recent study into the " to be or not to be " of self-employment revealed a national reluctance among germans to go it alone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 germany 's media struggle with migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's missing in germany is an awareness of every-day migrant life even though some 7.3 million foreigners currently live in germany , migrant life still gets a bad rap in the media .
public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches . if german television is anything to go by , muslim life is still shackled by tradition and overshadowed by crime .
its image took an even steeper downward plunge after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , said fritz pleitgen , director of german public broadcaster wdr . but migrant life is n't all bad news , he insisted - and it 's high time television delivered the broader picture . melting pot germany " honor killings and arranged marriages make more of a splash in the media that differentiated depictions of normal life among migrants , " pleitgen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asli bayram was crowned miss germany 2005 he 'd rather see more coverage of upbeat news about the country 's minorities - like german-turkish director fatih akin winning the golden bear at the berlin film festival and asli bayram -lrb- photo -rrb- scooping this year 's miss germany title . after all , contemporary germany is increasing becoming a proverbial melting pot .
cultural borders have never been more blurred - one in six marriages is inter-cultural and one in four children born in germany has at least one non-german parent . remaining objective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the other hand , gang violence , honor killings and the sort of muslim fundamentalism practiced , for example , by the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who is now standing trial in istanbul after germany extradited him last year , are also a fact of modern life . but it needs to be stressed that these cases are exceptions , said marie-luise beck , a government expert on migration .
at a time when economic problems are creating wide-scale insecurity and resentment , society tends to look for scape-goats , she observed . " it 's important to report on what 's happening , " she said .
" the media has a duty to cover an inflammatory speech given by an imam .
but it 's equally important to report of the rise of right-wing extremism and show that it does n't only take the form of jackboots , it can also come packaged in a pin-stripe suit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an approach that can easily depoliticize extremism .
beck said that instead of exploring the roots of right-wing fanaticism , the media tends to promote a stereotypical image of shaven-headed nazis in bomber jackets which fails to convey the full extent of the problem - and the rise of middle-class reactionaries . beate winkler from the european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia also had reservations about the way the media portrays right-wing extremism . " right-wing extremists are turned into victims to such an extent that viewers can identify with them , " she said .
" at the same time no one really looks at their broader social role . " " why ca n't we take them as they are ? " so what can be done to encourage more objective reporting ?
while many feel that germany 's public broadcasters should assume an educational responsibility by depicting positive examples of integration , others caution against taking an over-optimistic approach . " people are always saying television should show more good news , " said ulrich deppendorf from wdr .
" but if we only ever showed positive images , we 'd lost some of our credibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to media expert rainer braun , the problem is that migrants still have n't hit the mainstream . " why is it so hard to have people from other backgrounds fronting any thing other than specifically multi-cultural shows ? " he asked .
" why could n't they read the prime-time news or host political shows - why ca n't we just take them as they are ? " cem say -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de being turkish and gay in germany germany may be considered a tolerant place for homosexuals .
but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality .
-lrb- sept .
25 , 2004 -rrb- breaking the mold turkey 's bid for eu membership might still be a touch-and-go issue , but a look at germany ’ s cultural mainstream shows that the country ’ s turkish community has never been more visible .

i 'm on a walking tour called " call cutta , " through an unfamiliar and desolate stretch of berlin 's usually vibrant kreuzberg neighborhood .
after renting a hands-free mobile set from the local hebbel theater and waiting for a call , i 'm now following instructions provided via the phone by a flirtatious guide calling himself ' bruce . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin .
for the past hour , he 's navigated me through buildings , parks , playgrounds , cellars and courtyards , fed me intriguing scraps of information on the history of the area and teased out some rather personal details . but , as i consider his latest question , i suspect bruce does it all the time .
after all , he 's never set eyes on the landscape he 's been meticulously steering me through .
what 's more , ' bruce ' is n't even his real name .
in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .
the artists were inspired by salt lake city , a booming district of glass buildings housing call centers on the outskirts of the city .
" it was a total contrast to everything else in calcutta , " said daniel wetzel , one of the artists in the group .
" it was also surreal .
suddenly the west with its money and capitalism was here and the people sitting in these buildings were pretending to be a part of it - it provided the perfect stage setting . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " call cutta " performers in calcutta much like siemens and other german companies who have rushed to india to take advantage of low labor costs , the artists ' outsourced ' the " call cutta " project : they hired ten people in calcutta , some of them fluent in german , set them up in a glitzy call center and trained them in a basic script detailing routes and landmarks in a neighborhood in calcutta and in berlin .
naturally indian the rest of the performance was pretty much left up to them .
" there are clear limits in a call center .
we wanted to get away from that and allow the operators to improvise and bring in their own voices , " said wetzel .
" theater is all about the senses .
in this case the feeling that you 're talking to a real person is important even though it 's from a great distance . "
thus , unlike the operators in india 's booming call centers who dub themselves " john " and " sara " and adopt british and american accents to disguise their origin and put their customers in the west at ease , the calcutta call center performers sound unabashedly indian and human as they guide , flirt , play-act and even sing their way around on the tour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin david xavier -lrb- his real name -rrb- , who steers people through the northern calcutta neighborhood of hatibagan in the afternoon and through kreuzberg in the evening , said it 's all a matter of being imaginative .
" the reaction from walkers , whether in berlin or calcutta , is overwhelmingly positive , " the 39-year-old said .
" they 're surprised at the different perspectives the tour can open up about their own cities . "
more than a telephone connection there 's another twist to the surprise and weirdness of the tour - the artists have woven in the history of colonial india 's struggle for independence from the british into the kreuzberg district where the " call cutta " tour is set .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose thus , obediently following bruce 's instructions and feeling like i 'm on a treasure hunt , i get down on my hands and knees next to a dustbin in a park and peer underneath it to find a faded picture of subhas chandra bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a famous freedom fighter from bengal .
bose spent time between 1941 and 1943 in berlin trying to recruit hitler 's help in fighting the british .
apparently his office and the radio station " free india " he set up were once in this area . further along , to the amusement of a gaggle of neighborhood children trailing me by now , i 'm led to another hidden photograph of a striking young indian soldier , one of the many thousands who belonged to bose 's " free india " army and which was incorporated into hitler 's until the end of the second world war .
connecting across the miles slightly overwhelmed by the intensity and busyness of the encounter but looking at my surroundings with new eyes , i come to the end of the tour in a shiny mall at potsdamer platz to finally see ' bruce ' waving at me from a small screen in the window of a consumer electronics store .
according to the artists , the prime goal of the project , despite occasional hitches like the phone connection being lost , is communication .
" people here might know a lot about india and the call center boom , " said wetzel .
" but all that knowledge does n't help in countering unfair clichés if you 've never really spoken to or had a real exchange with an indian . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists need n't worry about that .

"
what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?
a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . " " have you ever lied on the phone or used a false name ? " - the unexpected question asked huskily in an indian accent over my headphones stops me in my tracks .
i 'm on a walking tour called " call cutta , " through an unfamiliar and desolate stretch of berlin 's usually vibrant kreuzberg neighborhood .
after renting a hands-free mobile set from the local hebbel theater and waiting for a call , i 'm now following instructions provided via the phone by a flirtatious guide calling himself ' bruce . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin .
for the past hour , he 's navigated me through buildings , parks , playgrounds , cellars and courtyards , fed me intriguing scraps of information on the history of the area and teased out some rather personal details . but , as i consider his latest question , i suspect bruce does it all the time .
after all , he 's never set eyes on the landscape he 's been meticulously steering me through .
what 's more , ' bruce ' is n't even his real name .
in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .
the artists were inspired by salt lake city , a booming district of glass buildings housing call centers on the outskirts of the city .
" it was a total contrast to everything else in calcutta , " said daniel wetzel , one of the artists in the group .
" it was also surreal .
suddenly the west with its money and capitalism was here and the people sitting in these buildings were pretending to be a part of it - it provided the perfect stage setting . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " call cutta " performers in calcutta much like siemens and other german companies who have rushed to india to take advantage of low labor costs , the artists ' outsourced ' the " call cutta " project : they hired ten people in calcutta , some of them fluent in german , set them up in a glitzy call center and trained them in a basic script detailing routes and landmarks in a neighborhood in calcutta and in berlin .
naturally indian the rest of the performance was pretty much left up to them .
" there are clear limits in a call center .
we wanted to get away from that and allow the operators to improvise and bring in their own voices , " said wetzel .
" theater is all about the senses .
in this case the feeling that you 're talking to a real person is important even though it 's from a great distance . "
thus , unlike the operators in india 's booming call centers who dub themselves " john " and " sara " and adopt british and american accents to disguise their origin and put their customers in the west at ease , the calcutta call center performers sound unabashedly indian and human as they guide , flirt , play-act and even sing their way around on the tour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin david xavier -lrb- his real name -rrb- , who steers people through the northern calcutta neighborhood of hatibagan in the afternoon and through kreuzberg in the evening , said it 's all a matter of being imaginative .
" the reaction from walkers , whether in berlin or calcutta , is overwhelmingly positive , " the 39-year-old said .
" they 're surprised at the different perspectives the tour can open up about their own cities . "

the system is intended to replace patriot missiles in the united states and germany , and nike hercules missiles in italy . but for green party chief reinhard bütikofer , there are still some reservations with regard to the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer " it was n't easy at all for us , " bütikofer said in berlin on monday , adding that his party , with its deeply pacifist roots , had decided to reluctantly throw their weight behind it after considering the project in its entirety .
at the same time he said his party continued to have misgivings about the concrete military need for the project as well as the costs involved . reservations remain the us , germany and italy are funding meads in shares of 58 percent , 25 percent and 17 percent respectively .
for germany alone , this amounts to 886 million euros -lrb- $ 1,154 million -rrb- over a period of eight years .
more costs could follow . germany ’ s greens are worried that the costs involved in the missile defense project could balloon out of control .
but despite their concerns , green party leaders have decided that they do not want to risk a dispute within the coalition government .
that 's why they 've recommended that the green parliamentary group vote in favor of germany 's involvement in the project . chancellor schröder 's ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are happy with this development .
spd party chair franz münterfering is now reassured ahead of parliament 's budgetary committee meeting later this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering münterfering said he expects wednesday 's vote to be in favor of the meads project . " it is also a question of germany 's reliability , " he said .
" we never had any doubt that this should be possible , and we are pleased that we can now come to this decision . " reliability at stake the need for germany to be seen as reliable by its ally , the united states , was one of the social democrats ’ primary arguments for supporting the meads project – which is the largest transatlantic missile defense system .
the greens seem to have accepted this argument , but by way of compromise they are insisting that other defense costs be reduced . on tuesday , the greens are expected to signal their support for the meads project within the bundestag lower house of parliament .
when the budgetary committee gives its approval as expected on wednesday , the german government can finally confirm its long-awaited participation in the transatlantic defense system . nina werkhäuser -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meads defense system in the firing line ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 germany 's media struggle with migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's missing in germany is an awareness of every-day migrant life even though some 7.3 million foreigners currently live in germany , migrant life still gets a bad rap in the media .
public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches . if german television is anything to go by , muslim life is still shackled by tradition and overshadowed by crime .
its image took an even steeper downward plunge after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , said fritz pleitgen , director of german public broadcaster wdr . but migrant life is n't all bad news , he insisted - and it 's high time television delivered the broader picture . melting pot germany " honor killings and arranged marriages make more of a splash in the media that differentiated depictions of normal life among migrants , " pleitgen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asli bayram was crowned miss germany 2005 he 'd rather see more coverage of upbeat news about the country 's minorities - like german-turkish director fatih akin winning the golden bear at the berlin film festival and asli bayram -lrb- photo -rrb- scooping this year 's miss germany title . after all , contemporary germany is increasing becoming a proverbial melting pot .
cultural borders have never been more blurred - one in six marriages is inter-cultural and one in four children born in germany has at least one non-german parent . remaining objective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the other hand , gang violence , honor killings and the sort of muslim fundamentalism practiced , for example , by the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who is now standing trial in istanbul after germany extradited him last year , are also a fact of modern life . but it needs to be stressed that these cases are exceptions , said marie-luise beck , a government expert on migration .
at a time when economic problems are creating wide-scale insecurity and resentment , society tends to look for scape-goats , she observed . " it 's important to report on what 's happening , " she said .
" the media has a duty to cover an inflammatory speech given by an imam .
but it 's equally important to report of the rise of right-wing extremism and show that it does n't only take the form of jackboots , it can also come packaged in a pin-stripe suit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an approach that can easily depoliticize extremism .
beck said that instead of exploring the roots of right-wing fanaticism , the media tends to promote a stereotypical image of shaven-headed nazis in bomber jackets which fails to convey the full extent of the problem - and the rise of middle-class reactionaries . beate winkler from the european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia also had reservations about the way the media portrays right-wing extremism . " right-wing extremists are turned into victims to such an extent that viewers can identify with them , " she said .
" at the same time no one really looks at their broader social role . " " why ca n't we take them as they are ? " so what can be done to encourage more objective reporting ?
while many feel that germany 's public broadcasters should assume an educational responsibility by depicting positive examples of integration , others caution against taking an over-optimistic approach . " people are always saying television should show more good news , " said ulrich deppendorf from wdr .
" but if we only ever showed positive images , we 'd lost some of our credibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to media expert rainer braun , the problem is that migrants still have n't hit the mainstream . " why is it so hard to have people from other backgrounds fronting any thing other than specifically multi-cultural shows ? " he asked .
" why could n't they read the prime-time news or host political shows - why ca n't we just take them as they are ? " cem say -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de being turkish and gay in germany germany may be considered a tolerant place for homosexuals .
but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality .
-lrb- sept .
25 , 2004 -rrb- breaking the mold turkey 's bid for eu membership might still be a touch-and-go issue , but a look at germany ’ s cultural mainstream shows that the country ’ s turkish community has never been more visible .
-lrb- aug .
12 , 2004 -rrb- when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .
but how deep does the concept of honor run among some immigrant communities ?

public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches . if german television is anything to go by , muslim life is still shackled by tradition and overshadowed by crime .
its image took an even steeper downward plunge after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , said fritz pleitgen , director of german public broadcaster wdr . but migrant life is n't all bad news , he insisted - and it 's high time television delivered the broader picture . melting pot germany " honor killings and arranged marriages make more of a splash in the media that differentiated depictions of normal life among migrants , " pleitgen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asli bayram was crowned miss germany 2005 he 'd rather see more coverage of upbeat news about the country 's minorities - like german-turkish director fatih akin winning the golden bear at the berlin film festival and asli bayram -lrb- photo -rrb- scooping this year 's miss germany title . after all , contemporary germany is increasing becoming a proverbial melting pot .
cultural borders have never been more blurred - one in six marriages is inter-cultural and one in four children born in germany has at least one non-german parent . remaining objective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the other hand , gang violence , honor killings and the sort of muslim fundamentalism practiced , for example , by the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who is now standing trial in istanbul after germany extradited him last year , are also a fact of modern life . but it needs to be stressed that these cases are exceptions , said marie-luise beck , a government expert on migration .
at a time when economic problems are creating wide-scale insecurity and resentment , society tends to look for scape-goats , she observed . " it 's important to report on what 's happening , " she said .
" the media has a duty to cover an inflammatory speech given by an imam .
but it 's equally important to report of the rise of right-wing extremism and show that it does n't only take the form of jackboots , it can also come packaged in a pin-stripe suit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an approach that can easily depoliticize extremism .
beck said that instead of exploring the roots of right-wing fanaticism , the media tends to promote a stereotypical image of shaven-headed nazis in bomber jackets which fails to convey the full extent of the problem - and the rise of middle-class reactionaries . beate winkler from the european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia also had reservations about the way the media portrays right-wing extremism . " right-wing extremists are turned into victims to such an extent that viewers can identify with them , " she said .
" at the same time no one really looks at their broader social role . " " why ca n't we take them as they are ? " so what can be done to encourage more objective reporting ?
while many feel that germany 's public broadcasters should assume an educational responsibility by depicting positive examples of integration , others caution against taking an over-optimistic approach . " people are always saying television should show more good news , " said ulrich deppendorf from wdr .
" but if we only ever showed positive images , we 'd lost some of our credibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to media expert rainer braun , the problem is that migrants still have n't hit the mainstream . " why is it so hard to have people from other backgrounds fronting any thing other than specifically multi-cultural shows ? " he asked .
" why could n't they read the prime-time news or host political shows - why ca n't we just take them as they are ? " cem say -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de being turkish and gay in germany germany may be considered a tolerant place for homosexuals .
but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.04.2005 crisis deepens over french eu stance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' non ' camp is gaining strength even as french voters look set to torpedo the eu constitution in a referendum , luxembourg premier juncker added a new twist to the dilemma this week , saying the us hopes the french will reject the treaty . " i do n't think that people in the us and the anglo-saxon countries would be unsatisfied with a french rejection , " juncker , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said in an interview on french radio . " that would in fact correspond with their idea of europe as one that 's weakened , because it would mean giving up the most noble of its ambitions for the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker is worried about the french referendum .
juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the us and other anglo-saxon countries had no sympathy for " the idea of a constitution , for this strengthening of europe , " and they did n't want europe as " a completely responsible and competent player " on the world stage . juncker 's comments come at a time of growing concern in france and elsewhere in on the continent that a french " non " to the treaty would effectively throw the entire european integration process into disarray . drawn up by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , the constitution is meant to simplify decision-making in the european union but it must first be adopted by all 25 member states . six weeks before the planned french referendum on may 29 , opinion polls show 55 percent support for ' no ' with 45 percent backing the document . vote sparks infighting in government inside france , rejecting the constitution would gravely undermine the standing of president jacques chirac 's government .
but it would also set off a bitter internal war among the socialists , whose leadership is campaigning in favor of the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac during his television appearance in an attempt to lobby support for the eu constitution hopes that chirac could revitalize the fortunes of the ' yes ' camp in a two-hour appearance before a group of 80 young people have come to nothing .
chirac said during the television debate on thursday that he will not personally resign if the constitution is rejected by the electorate , but the dismissal of a prime minister is the standard way for a french president to extricate himself from political difficulties . on tuesday there were clear signals that prime minister jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- will lose his job if opponents of the text win the referendum .
tensions over the continuing failure of the government 's " yes " campaign spilled over at a weekly ministerial breakfast meeting with what officials described as a " very violent argument " between raffarin and interior minister dominique de villepin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- was reportedly furious about remarks made by villepin in a radio interview sunday that were openly critical of the way the government has handled the run-up to the may 29 vote and hinted at the prime minister 's approaching replacement . concerns in germany meanwhile , politicians in germany seemed alarmed at the consequences for europe of a french rejection . german interior minister otto schily warned that a french ' no ' would also be a serious setback for european home affairs and justice policies .
" i really hope that the french people can be successfully convinced that they would be making a serious mistake if this referendum fails , " schily said tuesday in berlin . germany will not hold a referendum on the constitution but will put it to a vote before parliament .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , is set to ratify the treaty on may 12 - ahead of the french referendum - to give its neighbor a boost .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is expected to rubber-stamp it a few weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer , however , put a brave face on the french crisis on monday . " i firmly believe that france , despite the current opinion polls , will vote ' yes ' , " he told handelsblatt business daily .
fischer said that france 's approval of the first eu constitution was crucial as " the founding nation of the european union . " the green party politician said the only alternative to allowing the treaty to come into force would be to revert to the 2000 treaty of nice , which eu leaders have described as a recipe for deadlock in an expanding bloc . " it is an illusion to think one could reopen the constitutional package and renegotiate it .
there will not be a better eu constitution in the foreseeable future , " fischer said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french ' yes ' referendum camp fights back french president jacques chirac is leading an offensive to convince reluctant french voters of the merits of the eu constitution .

" i do n't think that people in the us and the anglo-saxon countries would be unsatisfied with a french rejection , " juncker , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said in an interview on french radio .

a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . " " have you ever lied on the phone or used a false name ? " - the unexpected question asked huskily in an indian accent over my headphones stops me in my tracks .
i 'm on a walking tour called " call cutta , " through an unfamiliar and desolate stretch of berlin 's usually vibrant kreuzberg neighborhood .
after renting a hands-free mobile set from the local hebbel theater and waiting for a call , i 'm now following instructions provided via the phone by a flirtatious guide calling himself ' bruce . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin .
for the past hour , he 's navigated me through buildings , parks , playgrounds , cellars and courtyards , fed me intriguing scraps of information on the history of the area and teased out some rather personal details . but , as i consider his latest question , i suspect bruce does it all the time .
after all , he 's never set eyes on the landscape he 's been meticulously steering me through .
what 's more , ' bruce ' is n't even his real name .
in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .
the artists were inspired by salt lake city , a booming district of glass buildings housing call centers on the outskirts of the city .
" it was a total contrast to everything else in calcutta , " said daniel wetzel , one of the artists in the group .
" it was also surreal .
suddenly the west with its money and capitalism was here and the people sitting in these buildings were pretending to be a part of it - it provided the perfect stage setting . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " call cutta " performers in calcutta much like siemens and other german companies who have rushed to india to take advantage of low labor costs , the artists ' outsourced ' the " call cutta " project : they hired ten people in calcutta , some of them fluent in german , set them up in a glitzy call center and trained them in a basic script detailing routes and landmarks in a neighborhood in calcutta and in berlin .
naturally indian the rest of the performance was pretty much left up to them .
" there are clear limits in a call center .
we wanted to get away from that and allow the operators to improvise and bring in their own voices , " said wetzel .
" theater is all about the senses .
in this case the feeling that you 're talking to a real person is important even though it 's from a great distance . "
thus , unlike the operators in india 's booming call centers who dub themselves " john " and " sara " and adopt british and american accents to disguise their origin and put their customers in the west at ease , the calcutta call center performers sound unabashedly indian and human as they guide , flirt , play-act and even sing their way around on the tour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin david xavier -lrb- his real name -rrb- , who steers people through the northern calcutta neighborhood of hatibagan in the afternoon and through kreuzberg in the evening , said it 's all a matter of being imaginative .
" the reaction from walkers , whether in berlin or calcutta , is overwhelmingly positive , " the 39-year-old said .
" they 're surprised at the different perspectives the tour can open up about their own cities . "
more than a telephone connection there 's another twist to the surprise and weirdness of the tour - the artists have woven in the history of colonial india 's struggle for independence from the british into the kreuzberg district where the " call cutta " tour is set .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose thus , obediently following bruce 's instructions and feeling like i 'm on a treasure hunt , i get down on my hands and knees next to a dustbin in a park and peer underneath it to find a faded picture of subhas chandra bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a famous freedom fighter from bengal .
bose spent time between 1941 and 1943 in berlin trying to recruit hitler 's help in fighting the british .
apparently his office and the radio station " free india " he set up were once in this area . further along , to the amusement of a gaggle of neighborhood children trailing me by now , i 'm led to another hidden photograph of a striking young indian soldier , one of the many thousands who belonged to bose 's " free india " army and which was incorporated into hitler 's until the end of the second world war .
connecting across the miles slightly overwhelmed by the intensity and busyness of the encounter but looking at my surroundings with new eyes , i come to the end of the tour in a shiny mall at potsdamer platz to finally see ' bruce ' waving at me from a small screen in the window of a consumer electronics store .
according to the artists , the prime goal of the project , despite occasional hitches like the phone connection being lost , is communication .
" people here might know a lot about india and the call center boom , " said wetzel .
" but all that knowledge does n't help in countering unfair clichés if you 've never really spoken to or had a real exchange with an indian . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists need n't worry about that .
mark stuver , 30 , from san francisco , who was in berlin for the first time and did the tour with ' dawn , ' admitted he 'd exchanged phone numbers with her . " it was a bit crazy being guided in berlin all the way from india , " said stuver .

their basic technology is said to have been invented in germany , but it was companies elsewhere in the world that profited the most from selling them . focusing on opportunities in a bid to jumpstart german competitiveness , the german chancellor called on business and political leaders to show more courage when reaching out for tomorrow 's opportunities . " nobody says we should ignore risks , " he said .
" but it would be equally misplaced to become engrossed in constant analysis of what could go wrong and how could we minimize the effects .
we need a culture that focuses first and foremost on the opportunities , without , of course , letting the risks totally slip from view . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking at the opening of a nationwide campaign to promote up and coming young scientists , the chancellor highlighted a new government package of measures worth 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- , that was aimed at supporting universities and elite research centers in their bid to create innovative technologies and products . he also promised 140 million euros in state support for innovative start-up businesses , and demanded more funding from germany ’ s federal states for improvements in general education . opposition concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservative opposition on monday also devoted a symposium to innovation in germany .
cdu leader angela merkel criticized the schröder government for what she called its heavy-handed interference in the freedom of science and research . " we must make sure that research projects are only evaluated by researchers , " merkel said .
" if politics becomes involved in science , innovation is bound to suffer .
politicians tend to support only those projects which have already garnered much publicity and some public prominence . " merkel 's criticism concerns a research project into gene-spliced plants for which funding was stopped recently by the government .
merkel also accused germany 's green party of ideological bias with regard genetic engineering .
a recent genetic engineering law passed by the red-green government coalition , she said , was clearly meant to prevent innovation in agriculture rather than foster this technology . heinrich oberreuther , a political scientist , said party strategies towards an innovative economy could become a vote winner in germany . " a party that neglects this issue will cause major problems for germany as a whole , " he said .
" promoting innovation has become a matter of do or die for all political organizations . " low self-esteem and indeed , only about 11 percent of all germans believe that this country is still spearheading the drive for innovative products in the world . german pollster forsa published a survey on monday saying that 62 percent of people here think germany is now mediocre in the field of engineering and 25 percent believe standards have fallen below mediocre . but the forsa findings are thrown into a different light by a recent emnid report on " the image of germany abroad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sharp contrast to germany 's image of itself , the " made in germany " brand was given a high rating by the us , spain , england , france , sweden and poland . german companies do indeed enjoy greater profit growth than their us counterparts , and the country is an international market leader when it comes to innovative fields such as bio- and nanotechnology . if it wants to make lasting progress , germany will first have to overcome its inferiority complex . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reinventing german innovation a recent study into the " to be or not to be " of self-employment revealed a national reluctance among germans to go it alone .

bavarian cardinal joseph ratzinger became the 265th pope . germany 's joseph ratzinger was elected pope for the world 's one billion catholics on tuesday evening .
he chose the name benedict xvi .
the new pontiff briefly addressed the hundreds of thousands of catholics gathered at st. peter 's square from a balcony on st. peter 's basilica .
" dear brothers and sisters , after the great pope john paul ii the cardinals have elected me a simple and humble laborer in the vineyard of the lord , " he said , paying tribute to his predecessor .
the throngs of catholics filling the square had greeted with cheers smoke - which first appeared black , but then turned white - spewed from the chimney of the sistine chapel around 6 p.m.
-lrb- 1600 utc -rrb- to signal the cardinals had reached a two-thirds majority .
after a few minutes , the bells of st. peter 's basilica began pealing , confirming the election of a new pope .
soon after , ratzinger appeared on the balcony to the gleeful cheers of the thousands that had gathered .
in germany , a crowd began to gather in the pouring rain in regensburg , where the new pope was a longtime university professor .
bildunterschrift : priests celebrated as white smoke billowed from the chimney of the sistine chapel at the vatican , on tuesday ratzinger is considered one of the catholic church 's most powerful and most orthodox clergymen .
but it was n't always that way .
as a young man in bavaria , caught up in the reform-fervor that accompanied the 1960s student revolts , ratzinger was known as someone to support reforms in the church .
but that changed when pope john paul ii was elected in 1978 , ratzinger - made a cardinal in 1977 - quickly developed into his right-hand man .
the two shared similar conservative views against women in the church , abortion and pregnancy counseling centers .
he once called abortion a " culture of death . "
ratzinger also squabbled with three german cardinals in 1994 about divorcees being allowed to marry again in the church .
bildunterschrift : tourists wave the vatican and german flags as they celebrate in st. peter 's square at the vatican following the election of the new pope german politicians lined up to praise the new pope , the first from germany in over 480 years .
" i congratulate him heartily in the name of the german government and all the citizens of his home country germany , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said . at 78 , experts consider him a " transition pope " who wo n't hold the title as long as his predecessor john paul ii , who was pope for 26 years .
after being tucked away in secret conclaves in the sistine chapel on monday , the 115 cardinals of the conclave voted three times before coming to agreement on the new pope .
the vote is considered to have been one of the fastest in history . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from a small bavarian town to the papacy if his past statements are any indication , pope benedict xvi will continue to tread the conservative line that was among the defining characteristics of his predecessors long reign .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's pope pope stresses interfaith dialogue german reception of new pope mixed new pope delights and disappoints everyone 's wild about " ratzy " europe -pipe- 19.04.2005 from a small bavarian town to the papacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi at his first mass if his past statements are any indication , pope benedict xvi will continue to tread the conservative line that was among the defining characteristics of his predecessor 's long reign . born on april 16 , 1927 in the small , deeply religious town of markt am inn in bavaria , ratzinger decided early on to follow a theological career .
but the changing political situation in germany kept him from his goal for a short time .
his father , a former police officer , quit the force in 1937 rather than join the national socialist party .
ratzinger , who was in school at that point , was forced to join hitler youth , like all other boys .
the revelation made headlines last weekend after the sunday times of london reported it .
but ratzinger had stated often that he fled the organization as soon as he was no longer forced to go .
earnest and intellectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger celebrating mass in the mountains of ruhpolding , southern germany , in 1952 he was a serious student and very rational , traits that would accompany him all through his life and into the clergy .
an intellectual , he became a university professor in 1958 .
ratzinger 's career in theological academia lasted until march 1977 , when he was named the archbishop of munich and friesing .
a few months later , on june 27 , he was elevated to cardinal .
after john paul ii began his reign in 1978 , it did n't take long for ratzinger to gain his favor .
the two shared conservative views on abortion , pregnancy counseling and women in the church .
the bavarian was appointed prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in november 1981 .
ratzinger , the most influential cardinal under john paul ii , spoke out against abortion many times , calling it a " culture of death . "
he also shared his pope 's rejection of the us decision to go to war in iraq .
dismayed moderates as leader of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , ratzinger delighted the more conservative wing of the church and dismayed moderates and church reformers , who have strong backing in his home country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi , in 1982 , when he was archbishop of munich throughout the 1980s he disciplined latin american " liberation " theologists , who posit that the church should draw its strength from political activism relating to the poor .
in 1992 , leonard boff , one of the leading thinkers in this movement resigned his priesthood writing in a letter that the papacy of john paul ii was " cruel and without mercy . "
hints at future during mass as pope john paul ii neared death , ratzinger remained his most trusted servant and carried out his duties in his stead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 germany 's media struggle with migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's missing in germany is an awareness of every-day migrant life even though some 7.3 million foreigners currently live in germany , migrant life still gets a bad rap in the media .
public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches . if german television is anything to go by , muslim life is still shackled by tradition and overshadowed by crime .
its image took an even steeper downward plunge after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , said fritz pleitgen , director of german public broadcaster wdr . but migrant life is n't all bad news , he insisted - and it 's high time television delivered the broader picture . melting pot germany " honor killings and arranged marriages make more of a splash in the media that differentiated depictions of normal life among migrants , " pleitgen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asli bayram was crowned miss germany 2005 he 'd rather see more coverage of upbeat news about the country 's minorities - like german-turkish director fatih akin winning the golden bear at the berlin film festival and asli bayram -lrb- photo -rrb- scooping this year 's miss germany title . after all , contemporary germany is increasing becoming a proverbial melting pot .
cultural borders have never been more blurred - one in six marriages is inter-cultural and one in four children born in germany has at least one non-german parent . remaining objective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the other hand , gang violence , honor killings and the sort of muslim fundamentalism practiced , for example , by the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who is now standing trial in istanbul after germany extradited him last year , are also a fact of modern life . but it needs to be stressed that these cases are exceptions , said marie-luise beck , a government expert on migration .
at a time when economic problems are creating wide-scale insecurity and resentment , society tends to look for scape-goats , she observed . " it 's important to report on what 's happening , " she said .
" the media has a duty to cover an inflammatory speech given by an imam .
but it 's equally important to report of the rise of right-wing extremism and show that it does n't only take the form of jackboots , it can also come packaged in a pin-stripe suit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an approach that can easily depoliticize extremism .
beck said that instead of exploring the roots of right-wing fanaticism , the media tends to promote a stereotypical image of shaven-headed nazis in bomber jackets which fails to convey the full extent of the problem - and the rise of middle-class reactionaries . beate winkler from the european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia also had reservations about the way the media portrays right-wing extremism . " right-wing extremists are turned into victims to such an extent that viewers can identify with them , " she said .
" at the same time no one really looks at their broader social role . " " why ca n't we take them as they are ? " so what can be done to encourage more objective reporting ?
while many feel that germany 's public broadcasters should assume an educational responsibility by depicting positive examples of integration , others caution against taking an over-optimistic approach . " people are always saying television should show more good news , " said ulrich deppendorf from wdr .
" but if we only ever showed positive images , we 'd lost some of our credibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to media expert rainer braun , the problem is that migrants still have n't hit the mainstream . " why is it so hard to have people from other backgrounds fronting any thing other than specifically multi-cultural shows ? " he asked .
" why could n't they read the prime-time news or host political shows - why ca n't we just take them as they are ? " cem say -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de being turkish and gay in germany germany may be considered a tolerant place for homosexuals .
but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality .
-lrb- sept .
25 , 2004 -rrb- breaking the mold turkey 's bid for eu membership might still be a touch-and-go issue , but a look at germany ’ s cultural mainstream shows that the country ’ s turkish community has never been more visible .

the system is intended to replace patriot missiles in the united states and germany , and nike hercules missiles in italy . but for green party chief reinhard bütikofer , there are still some reservations with regard to the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer " it was n't easy at all for us , " bütikofer said in berlin on monday , adding that his party , with its deeply pacifist roots , had decided to reluctantly throw their weight behind it after considering the project in its entirety .
at the same time he said his party continued to have misgivings about the concrete military need for the project as well as the costs involved . reservations remain the us , germany and italy are funding meads in shares of 58 percent , 25 percent and 17 percent respectively .
for germany alone , this amounts to 886 million euros -lrb- $ 1,154 million -rrb- over a period of eight years .
more costs could follow . germany ’ s greens are worried that the costs involved in the missile defense project could balloon out of control .
but despite their concerns , green party leaders have decided that they do not want to risk a dispute within the coalition government .
that 's why they 've recommended that the green parliamentary group vote in favor of germany 's involvement in the project . chancellor schröder 's ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are happy with this development .
spd party chair franz münterfering is now reassured ahead of parliament 's budgetary committee meeting later this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering münterfering said he expects wednesday 's vote to be in favor of the meads project . " it is also a question of germany 's reliability , " he said .

the system is intended to replace patriot missiles in the united states and germany , and nike hercules missiles in italy . but for green party chief reinhard bütikofer , there are still some reservations with regard to the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer " it was n't easy at all for us , " bütikofer said in berlin on monday , adding that his party , with its deeply pacifist roots , had decided to reluctantly throw their weight behind it after considering the project in its entirety .
at the same time he said his party continued to have misgivings about the concrete military need for the project as well as the costs involved . reservations remain the us , germany and italy are funding meads in shares of 58 percent , 25 percent and 17 percent respectively .
for germany alone , this amounts to 886 million euros -lrb- $ 1,154 million -rrb- over a period of eight years .
more costs could follow . germany ’ s greens are worried that the costs involved in the missile defense project could balloon out of control .
but despite their concerns , green party leaders have decided that they do not want to risk a dispute within the coalition government .
that 's why they 've recommended that the green parliamentary group vote in favor of germany 's involvement in the project . chancellor schröder 's ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are happy with this development .
spd party chair franz münterfering is now reassured ahead of parliament 's budgetary committee meeting later this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering münterfering said he expects wednesday 's vote to be in favor of the meads project . " it is also a question of germany 's reliability , " he said .
" we never had any doubt that this should be possible , and we are pleased that we can now come to this decision . " reliability at stake the need for germany to be seen as reliable by its ally , the united states , was one of the social democrats ’ primary arguments for supporting the meads project – which is the largest transatlantic missile defense system .
the greens seem to have accepted this argument , but by way of compromise they are insisting that other defense costs be reduced . on tuesday , the greens are expected to signal their support for the meads project within the bundestag lower house of parliament .
when the budgetary committee gives its approval as expected on wednesday , the german government can finally confirm its long-awaited participation in the transatlantic defense system . nina werkhäuser -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meads defense system in the firing line ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 german politicians push innovation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young scientists should n't hide their light under a bushel the need to promote innovation , research and development has become a key issue in german politics , with both government and opposition outlining plans to improve what has apparently become a weak point in the economy . on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder called on german businesses to be more courageous when turning inventions into marketable products . the fax machine , the mobile phone and modern flat-panel screens have become symbols of german research ingenuity - but also of the country 's inability to turn them into money-making products .
their basic technology is said to have been invented in germany , but it was companies elsewhere in the world that profited the most from selling them . focusing on opportunities in a bid to jumpstart german competitiveness , the german chancellor called on business and political leaders to show more courage when reaching out for tomorrow 's opportunities . " nobody says we should ignore risks , " he said .
" but it would be equally misplaced to become engrossed in constant analysis of what could go wrong and how could we minimize the effects .
we need a culture that focuses first and foremost on the opportunities , without , of course , letting the risks totally slip from view . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking at the opening of a nationwide campaign to promote up and coming young scientists , the chancellor highlighted a new government package of measures worth 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- , that was aimed at supporting universities and elite research centers in their bid to create innovative technologies and products . he also promised 140 million euros in state support for innovative start-up businesses , and demanded more funding from germany ’ s federal states for improvements in general education . opposition concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservative opposition on monday also devoted a symposium to innovation in germany .
cdu leader angela merkel criticized the schröder government for what she called its heavy-handed interference in the freedom of science and research . " we must make sure that research projects are only evaluated by researchers , " merkel said .
" if politics becomes involved in science , innovation is bound to suffer .
politicians tend to support only those projects which have already garnered much publicity and some public prominence . " merkel 's criticism concerns a research project into gene-spliced plants for which funding was stopped recently by the government .
merkel also accused germany 's green party of ideological bias with regard genetic engineering .
a recent genetic engineering law passed by the red-green government coalition , she said , was clearly meant to prevent innovation in agriculture rather than foster this technology . heinrich oberreuther , a political scientist , said party strategies towards an innovative economy could become a vote winner in germany . " a party that neglects this issue will cause major problems for germany as a whole , " he said .
" promoting innovation has become a matter of do or die for all political organizations . " low self-esteem and indeed , only about 11 percent of all germans believe that this country is still spearheading the drive for innovative products in the world . german pollster forsa published a survey on monday saying that 62 percent of people here think germany is now mediocre in the field of engineering and 25 percent believe standards have fallen below mediocre . but the forsa findings are thrown into a different light by a recent emnid report on " the image of germany abroad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sharp contrast to germany 's image of itself , the " made in germany " brand was given a high rating by the us , spain , england , france , sweden and poland . german companies do indeed enjoy greater profit growth than their us counterparts , and the country is an international market leader when it comes to innovative fields such as bio- and nanotechnology . if it wants to make lasting progress , germany will first have to overcome its inferiority complex . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reinventing german innovation a recent study into the " to be or not to be " of self-employment revealed a national reluctance among germans to go it alone .
but inventors are crying out for a chance to give the country a cutting-edge status . -lrb- feb .
1 , 2005 -rrb- german innovation stalled at home internet calling , the biggest innovation in communications since the invention of the telephone , was " made in germany . "
but while the international market is booming , regulation has stalled its domestic advance .

their basic technology is said to have been invented in germany , but it was companies elsewhere in the world that profited the most from selling them . focusing on opportunities in a bid to jumpstart german competitiveness , the german chancellor called on business and political leaders to show more courage when reaching out for tomorrow 's opportunities . " nobody says we should ignore risks , " he said .
" but it would be equally misplaced to become engrossed in constant analysis of what could go wrong and how could we minimize the effects .
we need a culture that focuses first and foremost on the opportunities , without , of course , letting the risks totally slip from view . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking at the opening of a nationwide campaign to promote up and coming young scientists , the chancellor highlighted a new government package of measures worth 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- , that was aimed at supporting universities and elite research centers in their bid to create innovative technologies and products . he also promised 140 million euros in state support for innovative start-up businesses , and demanded more funding from germany ’ s federal states for improvements in general education . opposition concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservative opposition on monday also devoted a symposium to innovation in germany .
cdu leader angela merkel criticized the schröder government for what she called its heavy-handed interference in the freedom of science and research . " we must make sure that research projects are only evaluated by researchers , " merkel said .
" if politics becomes involved in science , innovation is bound to suffer .
politicians tend to support only those projects which have already garnered much publicity and some public prominence . " merkel 's criticism concerns a research project into gene-spliced plants for which funding was stopped recently by the government .
merkel also accused germany 's green party of ideological bias with regard genetic engineering .
a recent genetic engineering law passed by the red-green government coalition , she said , was clearly meant to prevent innovation in agriculture rather than foster this technology . heinrich oberreuther , a political scientist , said party strategies towards an innovative economy could become a vote winner in germany .

"
what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?
a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . " " have you ever lied on the phone or used a false name ? " - the unexpected question asked huskily in an indian accent over my headphones stops me in my tracks .
i 'm on a walking tour called " call cutta , " through an unfamiliar and desolate stretch of berlin 's usually vibrant kreuzberg neighborhood .
after renting a hands-free mobile set from the local hebbel theater and waiting for a call , i 'm now following instructions provided via the phone by a flirtatious guide calling himself ' bruce . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin .
for the past hour , he 's navigated me through buildings , parks , playgrounds , cellars and courtyards , fed me intriguing scraps of information on the history of the area and teased out some rather personal details . but , as i consider his latest question , i suspect bruce does it all the time .
after all , he 's never set eyes on the landscape he 's been meticulously steering me through .
what 's more , ' bruce ' is n't even his real name .
in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .
the artists were inspired by salt lake city , a booming district of glass buildings housing call centers on the outskirts of the city .
" it was a total contrast to everything else in calcutta , " said daniel wetzel , one of the artists in the group .
" it was also surreal .
suddenly the west with its money and capitalism was here and the people sitting in these buildings were pretending to be a part of it - it provided the perfect stage setting . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " call cutta " performers in calcutta much like siemens and other german companies who have rushed to india to take advantage of low labor costs , the artists ' outsourced ' the " call cutta " project : they hired ten people in calcutta , some of them fluent in german , set them up in a glitzy call center and trained them in a basic script detailing routes and landmarks in a neighborhood in calcutta and in berlin .
naturally indian the rest of the performance was pretty much left up to them .
" there are clear limits in a call center .
we wanted to get away from that and allow the operators to improvise and bring in their own voices , " said wetzel .

what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?
a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . " " have you ever lied on the phone or used a false name ? " - the unexpected question asked huskily in an indian accent over my headphones stops me in my tracks .
i 'm on a walking tour called " call cutta , " through an unfamiliar and desolate stretch of berlin 's usually vibrant kreuzberg neighborhood .
after renting a hands-free mobile set from the local hebbel theater and waiting for a call , i 'm now following instructions provided via the phone by a flirtatious guide calling himself ' bruce . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin .
for the past hour , he 's navigated me through buildings , parks , playgrounds , cellars and courtyards , fed me intriguing scraps of information on the history of the area and teased out some rather personal details . but , as i consider his latest question , i suspect bruce does it all the time .
after all , he 's never set eyes on the landscape he 's been meticulously steering me through .
what 's more , ' bruce ' is n't even his real name .
in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .
the artists were inspired by salt lake city , a booming district of glass buildings housing call centers on the outskirts of the city .
" it was a total contrast to everything else in calcutta , " said daniel wetzel , one of the artists in the group .
" it was also surreal .
suddenly the west with its money and capitalism was here and the people sitting in these buildings were pretending to be a part of it - it provided the perfect stage setting . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " call cutta " performers in calcutta much like siemens and other german companies who have rushed to india to take advantage of low labor costs , the artists ' outsourced ' the " call cutta " project : they hired ten people in calcutta , some of them fluent in german , set them up in a glitzy call center and trained them in a basic script detailing routes and landmarks in a neighborhood in calcutta and in berlin .

" there are clear limits in a call center .

" theater is all about the senses .

a new study has revealed that overweight men are more likely to remain faithful to their partners . when german health institute epicure questioned some 1,000 men between 31 and 69 about their sexuality , it discovered that one in five men fantasizes about having an affair .

seven percent of men enjoy sex with prostitutes , in comparison to just four percent of overweight men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low self-confidence is partly to blame , but rusch pointed out that the main reason is more likely to be lack of exercise and bad diet .

four of five men said they lead a healthy lifestyle in order to live longer and feel better , 55 per cent of them say they hope personal fitness will improve their self-confidence , while only 27 percent of the respondents said they worked out in order to appear more attractive . " ego tends to be the main motivation , " rusch said . even so , the older a man is , the more he earns and the better his education , the more effort he 'll put in to pleasing his partner . whatever the reasons , we now know that fat men are faithful .

flierl 's plan foresees building upon the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , the scene of several escape attempts during the cold war .
at present , about 70 meters of the former border strip have been bracketed off into two seven-meter high steel walls .
visitors can peer through slits in the hinterland wall into the empty death strip . however , the bernauer strasse memorial remains largely ignored by the hordes of daily tourists who prefer to flock to the more commercially-successful checkpoint charlie - the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin 's most famous cold war symbol . flierl hopes to change that by injecting some authenticity into the rather bleak landscape by transporting some further real pieces of the wall to the area . " no hollywood-like rebuilding " in addition , his plan envisions using the remains of the front and secondary wall scattered around on the scruffy parks in the area between the bernauer strasse , the nordbahnhof railway station and the mauerpark and combining it with some multimedia features such as video bus tours and electronic audio guides to give visitors a real feel of the horrors of the death strip . however flierl made clear that a " a hollywood-like rebuilding of the wall as a trivialized theme park " was definitely not on the cards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men read the letters , names of victims of the berlin-wall , of wooden crosses , standing next to a re-erected strip of the former berlin wall near checkpoint charlie in berlin on oct .
31 , 2004 .
the comment was directed at the controversial rebuilding of the wall at checkpoint charlie and a memorial with wooden crosses in memory of the wall victims erected by alexandra hildebrandt , head of the checkpoint charlie museum . the berlin senate for culture has been wrangling with hildebrandt for months over the controversial exhibit .
a local court has now ordered its removal .
flierl 's latest plans include erecting an " information pavilion " on the area . historians slam plan however , flierl 's plans , in particular his refusal to reconstruct old watch towers and security barriers near the bernauer strasse , also triggered criticism on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the august 17 , 1962 photo shows dying peter fechter carried away by east german border guards who shot him down when he tried to flee to the west .
klaus-dieter henke , historian at the university of dresden said the blueprint hardly mentioned the political actors who " deprived the people of freedom through cement and guns . " manfred wilke , head of the research group on the communist regime at berlin 's free university said the plan utterly lacked shedding light on the perpetrators and the historical context . " the words ' fleeing from the gdr ' does n't make an appearance in the paper at all , " wilke said .
" but , that 's what the people associate with the wall . " question mark over finances others have more immediate concerns .
alice ströver , the education expert of the local green party warned that the undertaking could end in naught if it 's too ambitious to start with and involves too many memorials at disparate sites . most importantly , there 's no mention as yet of what the whole project would cost and where the money will come - not an unimportant matter in a broke city . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trivializing the wall as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie .

"
what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?
a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . " " have you ever lied on the phone or used a false name ? " - the unexpected question asked huskily in an indian accent over my headphones stops me in my tracks .
i 'm on a walking tour called " call cutta , " through an unfamiliar and desolate stretch of berlin 's usually vibrant kreuzberg neighborhood .
after renting a hands-free mobile set from the local hebbel theater and waiting for a call , i 'm now following instructions provided via the phone by a flirtatious guide calling himself ' bruce . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin .
for the past hour , he 's navigated me through buildings , parks , playgrounds , cellars and courtyards , fed me intriguing scraps of information on the history of the area and teased out some rather personal details . but , as i consider his latest question , i suspect bruce does it all the time .
after all , he 's never set eyes on the landscape he 's been meticulously steering me through .
what 's more , ' bruce ' is n't even his real name .
in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .
the artists were inspired by salt lake city , a booming district of glass buildings housing call centers on the outskirts of the city .
" it was a total contrast to everything else in calcutta , " said daniel wetzel , one of the artists in the group .
" it was also surreal .
suddenly the west with its money and capitalism was here and the people sitting in these buildings were pretending to be a part of it - it provided the perfect stage setting . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " call cutta " performers in calcutta much like siemens and other german companies who have rushed to india to take advantage of low labor costs , the artists ' outsourced ' the " call cutta " project : they hired ten people in calcutta , some of them fluent in german , set them up in a glitzy call center and trained them in a basic script detailing routes and landmarks in a neighborhood in calcutta and in berlin .
naturally indian the rest of the performance was pretty much left up to them .
" there are clear limits in a call center .
we wanted to get away from that and allow the operators to improvise and bring in their own voices , " said wetzel .
" theater is all about the senses .
in this case the feeling that you 're talking to a real person is important even though it 's from a great distance . "
thus , unlike the operators in india 's booming call centers who dub themselves " john " and " sara " and adopt british and american accents to disguise their origin and put their customers in the west at ease , the calcutta call center performers sound unabashedly indian and human as they guide , flirt , play-act and even sing their way around on the tour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin david xavier -lrb- his real name -rrb- , who steers people through the northern calcutta neighborhood of hatibagan in the afternoon and through kreuzberg in the evening , said it 's all a matter of being imaginative .
" the reaction from walkers , whether in berlin or calcutta , is overwhelmingly positive , " the 39-year-old said .
" they 're surprised at the different perspectives the tour can open up about their own cities . "
more than a telephone connection there 's another twist to the surprise and weirdness of the tour - the artists have woven in the history of colonial india 's struggle for independence from the british into the kreuzberg district where the " call cutta " tour is set .

bose spent time between 1941 and 1943 in berlin trying to recruit hitler 's help in fighting the british .
apparently his office and the radio station " free india " he set up were once in this area . further along , to the amusement of a gaggle of neighborhood children trailing me by now , i 'm led to another hidden photograph of a striking young indian soldier , one of the many thousands who belonged to bose 's " free india " army and which was incorporated into hitler 's until the end of the second world war .
connecting across the miles slightly overwhelmed by the intensity and busyness of the encounter but looking at my surroundings with new eyes , i come to the end of the tour in a shiny mall at potsdamer platz to finally see ' bruce ' waving at me from a small screen in the window of a consumer electronics store .
according to the artists , the prime goal of the project , despite occasional hitches like the phone connection being lost , is communication .
" people here might know a lot about india and the call center boom , " said wetzel .
" but all that knowledge does n't help in countering unfair clichés if you 've never really spoken to or had a real exchange with an indian . "

"
what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?
a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . " " have you ever lied on the phone or used a false name ? " - the unexpected question asked huskily in an indian accent over my headphones stops me in my tracks .
i 'm on a walking tour called " call cutta , " through an unfamiliar and desolate stretch of berlin 's usually vibrant kreuzberg neighborhood .
after renting a hands-free mobile set from the local hebbel theater and waiting for a call , i 'm now following instructions provided via the phone by a flirtatious guide calling himself ' bruce . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin .
for the past hour , he 's navigated me through buildings , parks , playgrounds , cellars and courtyards , fed me intriguing scraps of information on the history of the area and teased out some rather personal details . but , as i consider his latest question , i suspect bruce does it all the time .
after all , he 's never set eyes on the landscape he 's been meticulously steering me through .
what 's more , ' bruce ' is n't even his real name .
in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .
the artists were inspired by salt lake city , a booming district of glass buildings housing call centers on the outskirts of the city .
" it was a total contrast to everything else in calcutta , " said daniel wetzel , one of the artists in the group .
" it was also surreal .
suddenly the west with its money and capitalism was here and the people sitting in these buildings were pretending to be a part of it - it provided the perfect stage setting . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " call cutta " performers in calcutta much like siemens and other german companies who have rushed to india to take advantage of low labor costs , the artists ' outsourced ' the " call cutta " project : they hired ten people in calcutta , some of them fluent in german , set them up in a glitzy call center and trained them in a basic script detailing routes and landmarks in a neighborhood in calcutta and in berlin .
naturally indian the rest of the performance was pretty much left up to them .
" there are clear limits in a call center .
we wanted to get away from that and allow the operators to improvise and bring in their own voices , " said wetzel .
" theater is all about the senses .
in this case the feeling that you 're talking to a real person is important even though it 's from a great distance . "
thus , unlike the operators in india 's booming call centers who dub themselves " john " and " sara " and adopt british and american accents to disguise their origin and put their customers in the west at ease , the calcutta call center performers sound unabashedly indian and human as they guide , flirt , play-act and even sing their way around on the tour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin david xavier -lrb- his real name -rrb- , who steers people through the northern calcutta neighborhood of hatibagan in the afternoon and through kreuzberg in the evening , said it 's all a matter of being imaginative .
" the reaction from walkers , whether in berlin or calcutta , is overwhelmingly positive , " the 39-year-old said .
" they 're surprised at the different perspectives the tour can open up about their own cities . "
more than a telephone connection there 's another twist to the surprise and weirdness of the tour - the artists have woven in the history of colonial india 's struggle for independence from the british into the kreuzberg district where the " call cutta " tour is set .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose thus , obediently following bruce 's instructions and feeling like i 'm on a treasure hunt , i get down on my hands and knees next to a dustbin in a park and peer underneath it to find a faded picture of subhas chandra bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a famous freedom fighter from bengal .
bose spent time between 1941 and 1943 in berlin trying to recruit hitler 's help in fighting the british .
apparently his office and the radio station " free india " he set up were once in this area . further along , to the amusement of a gaggle of neighborhood children trailing me by now , i 'm led to another hidden photograph of a striking young indian soldier , one of the many thousands who belonged to bose 's " free india " army and which was incorporated into hitler 's until the end of the second world war .
connecting across the miles slightly overwhelmed by the intensity and busyness of the encounter but looking at my surroundings with new eyes , i come to the end of the tour in a shiny mall at potsdamer platz to finally see ' bruce ' waving at me from a small screen in the window of a consumer electronics store .
according to the artists , the prime goal of the project , despite occasional hitches like the phone connection being lost , is communication .
" people here might know a lot about india and the call center boom , " said wetzel .
" but all that knowledge does n't help in countering unfair clichés if you 've never really spoken to or had a real exchange with an indian . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists need n't worry about that .
mark stuver , 30 , from san francisco , who was in berlin for the first time and did the tour with ' dawn , ' admitted he 'd exchanged phone numbers with her . " it was a bit crazy being guided in berlin all the way from india , " said stuver .
" but , though we were thousands of miles apart , we still connected . "
the " call cutta " tour runs until june 26 , 2005 , daily , except monday and tuesday . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de outsourcing made in germany using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created .

the trial of lokman amin mohammed , 31 , is the first in germany of a suspect accused of terrorist activities in a foreign country .
mohammed faces charges of providing financial and logistical support to the extremist group ansar al-islam .
he is also accused of helping at least seven insurgents from iraq to come to europe , including a badly injured high-ranking ansar al-islam official for whom he managed to arrange treatment in britain .
prosecutors say mohammed also arranged medical supplies for insurgents fighting in iraq .
he was arrested in munich in december 2003 on a people smuggling charge before investigators began to look deeper into his alleged activities .
he had come to germany in 2000 , had valid residency papers and was employed on the production line of carmaker bmw .
the defense asked the judges in the munich court to adjourn to allow them more time to study documents which had recently come to light in a separate investigation .
the trial will not resume before may 31 . dw-world.de the trouble with nailing terror suspects another terror trial without a hard conviction this week has illustrated once more the difficulties the german judiciary has in putting terror suspects behind bars .
but some experts say prosecutors are learning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 germany 's media struggle with migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's missing in germany is an awareness of every-day migrant life even though some 7.3 million foreigners currently live in germany , migrant life still gets a bad rap in the media .
public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches . if german television is anything to go by , muslim life is still shackled by tradition and overshadowed by crime .
its image took an even steeper downward plunge after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , said fritz pleitgen , director of german public broadcaster wdr . but migrant life is n't all bad news , he insisted - and it 's high time television delivered the broader picture . melting pot germany " honor killings and arranged marriages make more of a splash in the media that differentiated depictions of normal life among migrants , " pleitgen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asli bayram was crowned miss germany 2005 he 'd rather see more coverage of upbeat news about the country 's minorities - like german-turkish director fatih akin winning the golden bear at the berlin film festival and asli bayram -lrb- photo -rrb- scooping this year 's miss germany title . after all , contemporary germany is increasing becoming a proverbial melting pot .
cultural borders have never been more blurred - one in six marriages is inter-cultural and one in four children born in germany has at least one non-german parent . remaining objective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the other hand , gang violence , honor killings and the sort of muslim fundamentalism practiced , for example , by the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who is now standing trial in istanbul after germany extradited him last year , are also a fact of modern life . but it needs to be stressed that these cases are exceptions , said marie-luise beck , a government expert on migration .
at a time when economic problems are creating wide-scale insecurity and resentment , society tends to look for scape-goats , she observed . " it 's important to report on what 's happening , " she said .
" the media has a duty to cover an inflammatory speech given by an imam .
but it 's equally important to report of the rise of right-wing extremism and show that it does n't only take the form of jackboots , it can also come packaged in a pin-stripe suit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an approach that can easily depoliticize extremism .
beck said that instead of exploring the roots of right-wing fanaticism , the media tends to promote a stereotypical image of shaven-headed nazis in bomber jackets which fails to convey the full extent of the problem - and the rise of middle-class reactionaries . beate winkler from the european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia also had reservations about the way the media portrays right-wing extremism . " right-wing extremists are turned into victims to such an extent that viewers can identify with them , " she said .
" at the same time no one really looks at their broader social role . " " why ca n't we take them as they are ? " so what can be done to encourage more objective reporting ?
while many feel that germany 's public broadcasters should assume an educational responsibility by depicting positive examples of integration , others caution against taking an over-optimistic approach . " people are always saying television should show more good news , " said ulrich deppendorf from wdr .
" but if we only ever showed positive images , we 'd lost some of our credibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to media expert rainer braun , the problem is that migrants still have n't hit the mainstream . " why is it so hard to have people from other backgrounds fronting any thing other than specifically multi-cultural shows ? " he asked .
" why could n't they read the prime-time news or host political shows - why ca n't we just take them as they are ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 german politicians push innovation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young scientists should n't hide their light under a bushel the need to promote innovation , research and development has become a key issue in german politics , with both government and opposition outlining plans to improve what has apparently become a weak point in the economy . on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder called on german businesses to be more courageous when turning inventions into marketable products . the fax machine , the mobile phone and modern flat-panel screens have become symbols of german research ingenuity - but also of the country 's inability to turn them into money-making products .
their basic technology is said to have been invented in germany , but it was companies elsewhere in the world that profited the most from selling them . focusing on opportunities in a bid to jumpstart german competitiveness , the german chancellor called on business and political leaders to show more courage when reaching out for tomorrow 's opportunities . " nobody says we should ignore risks , " he said .
" but it would be equally misplaced to become engrossed in constant analysis of what could go wrong and how could we minimize the effects .
we need a culture that focuses first and foremost on the opportunities , without , of course , letting the risks totally slip from view . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking at the opening of a nationwide campaign to promote up and coming young scientists , the chancellor highlighted a new government package of measures worth 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- , that was aimed at supporting universities and elite research centers in their bid to create innovative technologies and products . he also promised 140 million euros in state support for innovative start-up businesses , and demanded more funding from germany ’ s federal states for improvements in general education . opposition concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservative opposition on monday also devoted a symposium to innovation in germany .
cdu leader angela merkel criticized the schröder government for what she called its heavy-handed interference in the freedom of science and research . " we must make sure that research projects are only evaluated by researchers , " merkel said .
" if politics becomes involved in science , innovation is bound to suffer .
politicians tend to support only those projects which have already garnered much publicity and some public prominence . " merkel 's criticism concerns a research project into gene-spliced plants for which funding was stopped recently by the government .
merkel also accused germany 's green party of ideological bias with regard genetic engineering .
a recent genetic engineering law passed by the red-green government coalition , she said , was clearly meant to prevent innovation in agriculture rather than foster this technology . heinrich oberreuther , a political scientist , said party strategies towards an innovative economy could become a vote winner in germany . " a party that neglects this issue will cause major problems for germany as a whole , " he said .
" promoting innovation has become a matter of do or die for all political organizations . " low self-esteem and indeed , only about 11 percent of all germans believe that this country is still spearheading the drive for innovative products in the world . german pollster forsa published a survey on monday saying that 62 percent of people here think germany is now mediocre in the field of engineering and 25 percent believe standards have fallen below mediocre . but the forsa findings are thrown into a different light by a recent emnid report on " the image of germany abroad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sharp contrast to germany 's image of itself , the " made in germany " brand was given a high rating by the us , spain , england , france , sweden and poland . german companies do indeed enjoy greater profit growth than their us counterparts , and the country is an international market leader when it comes to innovative fields such as bio- and nanotechnology . if it wants to make lasting progress , germany will first have to overcome its inferiority complex . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reinventing german innovation a recent study into the " to be or not to be " of self-employment revealed a national reluctance among germans to go it alone .
but inventors are crying out for a chance to give the country a cutting-edge status . -lrb- feb .
1 , 2005 -rrb- german innovation stalled at home internet calling , the biggest innovation in communications since the invention of the telephone , was " made in germany . "
but while the international market is booming , regulation has stalled its domestic advance .
-lrb- dec .

but the 10 percent growth in exports did n't help the economy at home much . -lrb- jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 berlin presents concept for wall memorial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan wants to expand the official wall memorial at bernauer strasse 15 years after the fall of the wall , berlin 's culture commissioner has a blueprint to unite the city 's scattered cold war remnants into a coherent memorial concept and give tourists a real feel of the dark chapter . thomas flierl , berlin 's commissioner for culture , was showered with praise on monday by historians , politicians and victims of the former communist regime in east germany . but , the accolades were n't so much for his blueprint to highlight and better market the stray traces of the cold war as for the fact that his plan finally represents some concrete action on the subject 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall . " there has n't been a coherent wall concept so far , just remains of the wall scattered over the city - a double row of cobblestones in some places to mark the former border and a few disparate signs and plaques on the wall victims , ” dominique krüssen of the berlin senate for culture told dw-world last year .
" it probably was a mistake to tear it down to such a large extent in the early 1990s . " expanding official memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin visitors look through the wall at bernauer strasse on aug .
13 . , 2002 , the 41st anniversary of the building of the berlin wall .
flierl 's plan foresees building upon the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , the scene of several escape attempts during the cold war .
at present , about 70 meters of the former border strip have been bracketed off into two seven-meter high steel walls .
visitors can peer through slits in the hinterland wall into the empty death strip . however , the bernauer strasse memorial remains largely ignored by the hordes of daily tourists who prefer to flock to the more commercially-successful checkpoint charlie - the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin 's most famous cold war symbol . flierl hopes to change that by injecting some authenticity into the rather bleak landscape by transporting some further real pieces of the wall to the area . " no hollywood-like rebuilding " in addition , his plan envisions using the remains of the front and secondary wall scattered around on the scruffy parks in the area between the bernauer strasse , the nordbahnhof railway station and the mauerpark and combining it with some multimedia features such as video bus tours and electronic audio guides to give visitors a real feel of the horrors of the death strip . however flierl made clear that a " a hollywood-like rebuilding of the wall as a trivialized theme park " was definitely not on the cards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men read the letters , names of victims of the berlin-wall , of wooden crosses , standing next to a re-erected strip of the former berlin wall near checkpoint charlie in berlin on oct .
31 , 2004 .
the comment was directed at the controversial rebuilding of the wall at checkpoint charlie and a memorial with wooden crosses in memory of the wall victims erected by alexandra hildebrandt , head of the checkpoint charlie museum . the berlin senate for culture has been wrangling with hildebrandt for months over the controversial exhibit .
a local court has now ordered its removal .
flierl 's latest plans include erecting an " information pavilion " on the area . historians slam plan however , flierl 's plans , in particular his refusal to reconstruct old watch towers and security barriers near the bernauer strasse , also triggered criticism on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the august 17 , 1962 photo shows dying peter fechter carried away by east german border guards who shot him down when he tried to flee to the west .
klaus-dieter henke , historian at the university of dresden said the blueprint hardly mentioned the political actors who " deprived the people of freedom through cement and guns .

flierl 's plan foresees building upon the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , the scene of several escape attempts during the cold war .
at present , about 70 meters of the former border strip have been bracketed off into two seven-meter high steel walls .
visitors can peer through slits in the hinterland wall into the empty death strip . however , the bernauer strasse memorial remains largely ignored by the hordes of daily tourists who prefer to flock to the more commercially-successful checkpoint charlie - the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin 's most famous cold war symbol . flierl hopes to change that by injecting some authenticity into the rather bleak landscape by transporting some further real pieces of the wall to the area .

a local court has now ordered its removal .

their basic technology is said to have been invented in germany , but it was companies elsewhere in the world that profited the most from selling them . focusing on opportunities in a bid to jumpstart german competitiveness , the german chancellor called on business and political leaders to show more courage when reaching out for tomorrow 's opportunities . " nobody says we should ignore risks , " he said .
" but it would be equally misplaced to become engrossed in constant analysis of what could go wrong and how could we minimize the effects .
we need a culture that focuses first and foremost on the opportunities , without , of course , letting the risks totally slip from view . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking at the opening of a nationwide campaign to promote up and coming young scientists , the chancellor highlighted a new government package of measures worth 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- , that was aimed at supporting universities and elite research centers in their bid to create innovative technologies and products . he also promised 140 million euros in state support for innovative start-up businesses , and demanded more funding from germany ’ s federal states for improvements in general education . opposition concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservative opposition on monday also devoted a symposium to innovation in germany .
cdu leader angela merkel criticized the schröder government for what she called its heavy-handed interference in the freedom of science and research . " we must make sure that research projects are only evaluated by researchers , " merkel said .
" if politics becomes involved in science , innovation is bound to suffer .
politicians tend to support only those projects which have already garnered much publicity and some public prominence . " merkel 's criticism concerns a research project into gene-spliced plants for which funding was stopped recently by the government .
merkel also accused germany 's green party of ideological bias with regard genetic engineering .
a recent genetic engineering law passed by the red-green government coalition , she said , was clearly meant to prevent innovation in agriculture rather than foster this technology . heinrich oberreuther , a political scientist , said party strategies towards an innovative economy could become a vote winner in germany . " a party that neglects this issue will cause major problems for germany as a whole , " he said .
" promoting innovation has become a matter of do or die for all political organizations . " low self-esteem and indeed , only about 11 percent of all germans believe that this country is still spearheading the drive for innovative products in the world . german pollster forsa published a survey on monday saying that 62 percent of people here think germany is now mediocre in the field of engineering and 25 percent believe standards have fallen below mediocre . but the forsa findings are thrown into a different light by a recent emnid report on " the image of germany abroad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sharp contrast to germany 's image of itself , the " made in germany " brand was given a high rating by the us , spain , england , france , sweden and poland . german companies do indeed enjoy greater profit growth than their us counterparts , and the country is an international market leader when it comes to innovative fields such as bio- and nanotechnology . if it wants to make lasting progress , germany will first have to overcome its inferiority complex . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reinventing german innovation a recent study into the " to be or not to be " of self-employment revealed a national reluctance among germans to go it alone .

the system is intended to replace patriot missiles in the united states and germany , and nike hercules missiles in italy . but for green party chief reinhard bütikofer , there are still some reservations with regard to the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer " it was n't easy at all for us , " bütikofer said in berlin on monday , adding that his party , with its deeply pacifist roots , had decided to reluctantly throw their weight behind it after considering the project in its entirety .
at the same time he said his party continued to have misgivings about the concrete military need for the project as well as the costs involved . reservations remain the us , germany and italy are funding meads in shares of 58 percent , 25 percent and 17 percent respectively .
for germany alone , this amounts to 886 million euros -lrb- $ 1,154 million -rrb- over a period of eight years .
more costs could follow . germany ’ s greens are worried that the costs involved in the missile defense project could balloon out of control .
but despite their concerns , green party leaders have decided that they do not want to risk a dispute within the coalition government .
that 's why they 've recommended that the green parliamentary group vote in favor of germany 's involvement in the project . chancellor schröder 's ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are happy with this development .
spd party chair franz münterfering is now reassured ahead of parliament 's budgetary committee meeting later this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering münterfering said he expects wednesday 's vote to be in favor of the meads project . " it is also a question of germany 's reliability , " he said .
" we never had any doubt that this should be possible , and we are pleased that we can now come to this decision . " reliability at stake the need for germany to be seen as reliable by its ally , the united states , was one of the social democrats ’ primary arguments for supporting the meads project – which is the largest transatlantic missile defense system .
the greens seem to have accepted this argument , but by way of compromise they are insisting that other defense costs be reduced . on tuesday , the greens are expected to signal their support for the meads project within the bundestag lower house of parliament .
when the budgetary committee gives its approval as expected on wednesday , the german government can finally confirm its long-awaited participation in the transatlantic defense system . nina werkhäuser -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meads defense system in the firing line ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 germany 's media struggle with migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's missing in germany is an awareness of every-day migrant life even though some 7.3 million foreigners currently live in germany , migrant life still gets a bad rap in the media .
public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches . if german television is anything to go by , muslim life is still shackled by tradition and overshadowed by crime .
its image took an even steeper downward plunge after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , said fritz pleitgen , director of german public broadcaster wdr . but migrant life is n't all bad news , he insisted - and it 's high time television delivered the broader picture . melting pot germany " honor killings and arranged marriages make more of a splash in the media that differentiated depictions of normal life among migrants , " pleitgen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asli bayram was crowned miss germany 2005 he 'd rather see more coverage of upbeat news about the country 's minorities - like german-turkish director fatih akin winning the golden bear at the berlin film festival and asli bayram -lrb- photo -rrb- scooping this year 's miss germany title . after all , contemporary germany is increasing becoming a proverbial melting pot .
cultural borders have never been more blurred - one in six marriages is inter-cultural and one in four children born in germany has at least one non-german parent . remaining objective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the other hand , gang violence , honor killings and the sort of muslim fundamentalism practiced , for example , by the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who is now standing trial in istanbul after germany extradited him last year , are also a fact of modern life . but it needs to be stressed that these cases are exceptions , said marie-luise beck , a government expert on migration .
at a time when economic problems are creating wide-scale insecurity and resentment , society tends to look for scape-goats , she observed . " it 's important to report on what 's happening , " she said .
" the media has a duty to cover an inflammatory speech given by an imam .
but it 's equally important to report of the rise of right-wing extremism and show that it does n't only take the form of jackboots , it can also come packaged in a pin-stripe suit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an approach that can easily depoliticize extremism .
beck said that instead of exploring the roots of right-wing fanaticism , the media tends to promote a stereotypical image of shaven-headed nazis in bomber jackets which fails to convey the full extent of the problem - and the rise of middle-class reactionaries . beate winkler from the european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia also had reservations about the way the media portrays right-wing extremism . " right-wing extremists are turned into victims to such an extent that viewers can identify with them , " she said .
" at the same time no one really looks at their broader social role . " " why ca n't we take them as they are ? " so what can be done to encourage more objective reporting ?
while many feel that germany 's public broadcasters should assume an educational responsibility by depicting positive examples of integration , others caution against taking an over-optimistic approach . " people are always saying television should show more good news , " said ulrich deppendorf from wdr .
" but if we only ever showed positive images , we 'd lost some of our credibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to media expert rainer braun , the problem is that migrants still have n't hit the mainstream . " why is it so hard to have people from other backgrounds fronting any thing other than specifically multi-cultural shows ? " he asked .
" why could n't they read the prime-time news or host political shows - why ca n't we just take them as they are ? " cem say -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de being turkish and gay in germany germany may be considered a tolerant place for homosexuals .
but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality .
-lrb- sept .
25 , 2004 -rrb- breaking the mold turkey 's bid for eu membership might still be a touch-and-go issue , but a look at germany ’ s cultural mainstream shows that the country ’ s turkish community has never been more visible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.04.2005 crisis deepens over french eu stance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' non ' camp is gaining strength even as french voters look set to torpedo the eu constitution in a referendum , luxembourg premier juncker added a new twist to the dilemma this week , saying the us hopes the french will reject the treaty . " i do n't think that people in the us and the anglo-saxon countries would be unsatisfied with a french rejection , " juncker , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said in an interview on french radio . " that would in fact correspond with their idea of europe as one that 's weakened , because it would mean giving up the most noble of its ambitions for the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker is worried about the french referendum .
juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the us and other anglo-saxon countries had no sympathy for " the idea of a constitution , for this strengthening of europe , " and they did n't want europe as " a completely responsible and competent player " on the world stage . juncker 's comments come at a time of growing concern in france and elsewhere in on the continent that a french " non " to the treaty would effectively throw the entire european integration process into disarray . drawn up by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , the constitution is meant to simplify decision-making in the european union but it must first be adopted by all 25 member states . six weeks before the planned french referendum on may 29 , opinion polls show 55 percent support for ' no ' with 45 percent backing the document . vote sparks infighting in government inside france , rejecting the constitution would gravely undermine the standing of president jacques chirac 's government .
but it would also set off a bitter internal war among the socialists , whose leadership is campaigning in favor of the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac during his television appearance in an attempt to lobby support for the eu constitution hopes that chirac could revitalize the fortunes of the ' yes ' camp in a two-hour appearance before a group of 80 young people have come to nothing .
chirac said during the television debate on thursday that he will not personally resign if the constitution is rejected by the electorate , but the dismissal of a prime minister is the standard way for a french president to extricate himself from political difficulties . on tuesday there were clear signals that prime minister jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- will lose his job if opponents of the text win the referendum .
tensions over the continuing failure of the government 's " yes " campaign spilled over at a weekly ministerial breakfast meeting with what officials described as a " very violent argument " between raffarin and interior minister dominique de villepin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- was reportedly furious about remarks made by villepin in a radio interview sunday that were openly critical of the way the government has handled the run-up to the may 29 vote and hinted at the prime minister 's approaching replacement . concerns in germany meanwhile , politicians in germany seemed alarmed at the consequences for europe of a french rejection . german interior minister otto schily warned that a french ' no ' would also be a serious setback for european home affairs and justice policies .
" i really hope that the french people can be successfully convinced that they would be making a serious mistake if this referendum fails , " schily said tuesday in berlin . germany will not hold a referendum on the constitution but will put it to a vote before parliament .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , is set to ratify the treaty on may 12 - ahead of the french referendum - to give its neighbor a boost .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is expected to rubber-stamp it a few weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer , however , put a brave face on the french crisis on monday . " i firmly believe that france , despite the current opinion polls , will vote ' yes ' , " he told handelsblatt business daily .
fischer said that france 's approval of the first eu constitution was crucial as " the founding nation of the european union . " the green party politician said the only alternative to allowing the treaty to come into force would be to revert to the 2000 treaty of nice , which eu leaders have described as a recipe for deadlock in an expanding bloc . " it is an illusion to think one could reopen the constitutional package and renegotiate it .
there will not be a better eu constitution in the foreseeable future , " fischer said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french ' yes ' referendum camp fights back french president jacques chirac is leading an offensive to convince reluctant french voters of the merits of the eu constitution .

you might when you hear that at least he 's unlikely to stray .
a new study has revealed that overweight men are more likely to remain faithful to their partners . when german health institute epicure questioned some 1,000 men between 31 and 69 about their sexuality , it discovered that one in five men fantasizes about having an affair .
but the heavier he gets , the less likely he is to fancy a fling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so despite his obvious advantages , a man with six-pack abs does have his flaws . the impotence issue " the more you weigh , the less you 'll feel like sexual dalliances , " said sascha rusch from epicure . but do fat men just have fewer opportunities for hanky panky , or is their sex drive really lower ?
apparently so .
seven percent of men enjoy sex with prostitutes , in comparison to just four percent of overweight men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low self-confidence is partly to blame , but rusch pointed out that the main reason is more likely to be lack of exercise and bad diet . " only 44 percent of men believe in eating healthily , " he said .
" but there 's an immediate connection between obesity and impotence . " social standing if even getting up off the couch seems like an effort , bedroom frolics are probably the last thing on a man 's mind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the study also showed that 75 percent of men are willing to tackle lack of energy with regular sport - even if they do n't necessarily do so for the benefit of their better halves .
four of five men said they lead a healthy lifestyle in order to live longer and feel better , 55 per cent of them say they hope personal fitness will improve their self-confidence , while only 27 percent of the respondents said they worked out in order to appear more attractive . " ego tends to be the main motivation , " rusch said . even so , the older a man is , the more he earns and the better his education , the more effort he 'll put in to pleasing his partner . whatever the reasons , we now know that fat men are faithful .
but the inevitable question is : are their partners faithful to them ? dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans do n't do low-carb while the latest diet craze makes its way through the us , germans continue chomping down on bread and potatoes .

" i do n't think that people in the us and the anglo-saxon countries would be unsatisfied with a french rejection , " juncker , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said in an interview on french radio . " that would in fact correspond with their idea of europe as one that 's weakened , because it would mean giving up the most noble of its ambitions for the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker is worried about the french referendum .
juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the us and other anglo-saxon countries had no sympathy for " the idea of a constitution , for this strengthening of europe , " and they did n't want europe as " a completely responsible and competent player " on the world stage . juncker 's comments come at a time of growing concern in france and elsewhere in on the continent that a french " non " to the treaty would effectively throw the entire european integration process into disarray . drawn up by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , the constitution is meant to simplify decision-making in the european union but it must first be adopted by all 25 member states . six weeks before the planned french referendum on may 29 , opinion polls show 55 percent support for ' no ' with 45 percent backing the document . vote sparks infighting in government inside france , rejecting the constitution would gravely undermine the standing of president jacques chirac 's government .
but it would also set off a bitter internal war among the socialists , whose leadership is campaigning in favor of the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac during his television appearance in an attempt to lobby support for the eu constitution hopes that chirac could revitalize the fortunes of the ' yes ' camp in a two-hour appearance before a group of 80 young people have come to nothing .
chirac said during the television debate on thursday that he will not personally resign if the constitution is rejected by the electorate , but the dismissal of a prime minister is the standard way for a french president to extricate himself from political difficulties . on tuesday there were clear signals that prime minister jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- will lose his job if opponents of the text win the referendum .
tensions over the continuing failure of the government 's " yes " campaign spilled over at a weekly ministerial breakfast meeting with what officials described as a " very violent argument " between raffarin and interior minister dominique de villepin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- was reportedly furious about remarks made by villepin in a radio interview sunday that were openly critical of the way the government has handled the run-up to the may 29 vote and hinted at the prime minister 's approaching replacement . concerns in germany meanwhile , politicians in germany seemed alarmed at the consequences for europe of a french rejection . german interior minister otto schily warned that a french ' no ' would also be a serious setback for european home affairs and justice policies .
" i really hope that the french people can be successfully convinced that they would be making a serious mistake if this referendum fails , " schily said tuesday in berlin . germany will not hold a referendum on the constitution but will put it to a vote before parliament .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , is set to ratify the treaty on may 12 - ahead of the french referendum - to give its neighbor a boost .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is expected to rubber-stamp it a few weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer , however , put a brave face on the french crisis on monday . " i firmly believe that france , despite the current opinion polls , will vote ' yes ' , " he told handelsblatt business daily .
fischer said that france 's approval of the first eu constitution was crucial as " the founding nation of the european union . " the green party politician said the only alternative to allowing the treaty to come into force would be to revert to the 2000 treaty of nice , which eu leaders have described as a recipe for deadlock in an expanding bloc .

" i do n't think that people in the us and the anglo-saxon countries would be unsatisfied with a french rejection , " juncker , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said in an interview on french radio . " that would in fact correspond with their idea of europe as one that 's weakened , because it would mean giving up the most noble of its ambitions for the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker is worried about the french referendum .
juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the us and other anglo-saxon countries had no sympathy for " the idea of a constitution , for this strengthening of europe , " and they did n't want europe as " a completely responsible and competent player " on the world stage . juncker 's comments come at a time of growing concern in france and elsewhere in on the continent that a french " non " to the treaty would effectively throw the entire european integration process into disarray . drawn up by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , the constitution is meant to simplify decision-making in the european union but it must first be adopted by all 25 member states . six weeks before the planned french referendum on may 29 , opinion polls show 55 percent support for ' no ' with 45 percent backing the document . vote sparks infighting in government inside france , rejecting the constitution would gravely undermine the standing of president jacques chirac 's government .
but it would also set off a bitter internal war among the socialists , whose leadership is campaigning in favor of the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac during his television appearance in an attempt to lobby support for the eu constitution hopes that chirac could revitalize the fortunes of the ' yes ' camp in a two-hour appearance before a group of 80 young people have come to nothing .
chirac said during the television debate on thursday that he will not personally resign if the constitution is rejected by the electorate , but the dismissal of a prime minister is the standard way for a french president to extricate himself from political difficulties . on tuesday there were clear signals that prime minister jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- will lose his job if opponents of the text win the referendum .
tensions over the continuing failure of the government 's " yes " campaign spilled over at a weekly ministerial breakfast meeting with what officials described as a " very violent argument " between raffarin and interior minister dominique de villepin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- was reportedly furious about remarks made by villepin in a radio interview sunday that were openly critical of the way the government has handled the run-up to the may 29 vote and hinted at the prime minister 's approaching replacement . concerns in germany meanwhile , politicians in germany seemed alarmed at the consequences for europe of a french rejection . german interior minister otto schily warned that a french ' no ' would also be a serious setback for european home affairs and justice policies .
" i really hope that the french people can be successfully convinced that they would be making a serious mistake if this referendum fails , " schily said tuesday in berlin . germany will not hold a referendum on the constitution but will put it to a vote before parliament .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , is set to ratify the treaty on may 12 - ahead of the french referendum - to give its neighbor a boost .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is expected to rubber-stamp it a few weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer , however , put a brave face on the french crisis on monday . " i firmly believe that france , despite the current opinion polls , will vote ' yes ' , " he told handelsblatt business daily .
fischer said that france 's approval of the first eu constitution was crucial as " the founding nation of the european union . " the green party politician said the only alternative to allowing the treaty to come into force would be to revert to the 2000 treaty of nice , which eu leaders have described as a recipe for deadlock in an expanding bloc . " it is an illusion to think one could reopen the constitutional package and renegotiate it .
there will not be a better eu constitution in the foreseeable future , " fischer said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french ' yes ' referendum camp fights back french president jacques chirac is leading an offensive to convince reluctant french voters of the merits of the eu constitution .

a new study has revealed that overweight men are more likely to remain faithful to their partners . when german health institute epicure questioned some 1,000 men between 31 and 69 about their sexuality , it discovered that one in five men fantasizes about having an affair .

" social standing if even getting up off the couch seems like an effort , bedroom frolics are probably the last thing on a man 's mind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the study also showed that 75 percent of men are willing to tackle lack of energy with regular sport - even if they do n't necessarily do so for the benefit of their better halves .
four of five men said they lead a healthy lifestyle in order to live longer and feel better , 55 per cent of them say they hope personal fitness will improve their self-confidence , while only 27 percent of the respondents said they worked out in order to appear more attractive . " ego tends to be the main motivation , " rusch said . even so , the older a man is , the more he earns and the better his education , the more effort he 'll put in to pleasing his partner . whatever the reasons , we now know that fat men are faithful .

you might when you hear that at least he 's unlikely to stray .
a new study has revealed that overweight men are more likely to remain faithful to their partners . when german health institute epicure questioned some 1,000 men between 31 and 69 about their sexuality , it discovered that one in five men fantasizes about having an affair .

apparently so .
seven percent of men enjoy sex with prostitutes , in comparison to just four percent of overweight men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low self-confidence is partly to blame , but rusch pointed out that the main reason is more likely to be lack of exercise and bad diet . " only 44 percent of men believe in eating healthily , " he said .
" but there 's an immediate connection between obesity and impotence . " social standing if even getting up off the couch seems like an effort , bedroom frolics are probably the last thing on a man 's mind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the study also showed that 75 percent of men are willing to tackle lack of energy with regular sport - even if they do n't necessarily do so for the benefit of their better halves .
four of five men said they lead a healthy lifestyle in order to live longer and feel better , 55 per cent of them say they hope personal fitness will improve their self-confidence , while only 27 percent of the respondents said they worked out in order to appear more attractive . " ego tends to be the main motivation , " rusch said . even so , the older a man is , the more he earns and the better his education , the more effort he 'll put in to pleasing his partner . whatever the reasons , we now know that fat men are faithful .

"
what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?
a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . " " have you ever lied on the phone or used a false name ? " - the unexpected question asked huskily in an indian accent over my headphones stops me in my tracks .
i 'm on a walking tour called " call cutta , " through an unfamiliar and desolate stretch of berlin 's usually vibrant kreuzberg neighborhood .
after renting a hands-free mobile set from the local hebbel theater and waiting for a call , i 'm now following instructions provided via the phone by a flirtatious guide calling himself ' bruce . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin .
for the past hour , he 's navigated me through buildings , parks , playgrounds , cellars and courtyards , fed me intriguing scraps of information on the history of the area and teased out some rather personal details . but , as i consider his latest question , i suspect bruce does it all the time .
after all , he 's never set eyes on the landscape he 's been meticulously steering me through .
what 's more , ' bruce ' is n't even his real name .
in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .
the artists were inspired by salt lake city , a booming district of glass buildings housing call centers on the outskirts of the city .
" it was a total contrast to everything else in calcutta , " said daniel wetzel , one of the artists in the group .
" it was also surreal .
suddenly the west with its money and capitalism was here and the people sitting in these buildings were pretending to be a part of it - it provided the perfect stage setting . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " call cutta " performers in calcutta much like siemens and other german companies who have rushed to india to take advantage of low labor costs , the artists ' outsourced ' the " call cutta " project : they hired ten people in calcutta , some of them fluent in german , set them up in a glitzy call center and trained them in a basic script detailing routes and landmarks in a neighborhood in calcutta and in berlin .
naturally indian the rest of the performance was pretty much left up to them .
" there are clear limits in a call center .
we wanted to get away from that and allow the operators to improvise and bring in their own voices , " said wetzel .
" theater is all about the senses .
in this case the feeling that you 're talking to a real person is important even though it 's from a great distance . "
thus , unlike the operators in india 's booming call centers who dub themselves " john " and " sara " and adopt british and american accents to disguise their origin and put their customers in the west at ease , the calcutta call center performers sound unabashedly indian and human as they guide , flirt , play-act and even sing their way around on the tour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin david xavier -lrb- his real name -rrb- , who steers people through the northern calcutta neighborhood of hatibagan in the afternoon and through kreuzberg in the evening , said it 's all a matter of being imaginative .
" the reaction from walkers , whether in berlin or calcutta , is overwhelmingly positive , " the 39-year-old said .
" they 're surprised at the different perspectives the tour can open up about their own cities . "
more than a telephone connection there 's another twist to the surprise and weirdness of the tour - the artists have woven in the history of colonial india 's struggle for independence from the british into the kreuzberg district where the " call cutta " tour is set .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose thus , obediently following bruce 's instructions and feeling like i 'm on a treasure hunt , i get down on my hands and knees next to a dustbin in a park and peer underneath it to find a faded picture of subhas chandra bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a famous freedom fighter from bengal .
bose spent time between 1941 and 1943 in berlin trying to recruit hitler 's help in fighting the british .
apparently his office and the radio station " free india " he set up were once in this area . further along , to the amusement of a gaggle of neighborhood children trailing me by now , i 'm led to another hidden photograph of a striking young indian soldier , one of the many thousands who belonged to bose 's " free india " army and which was incorporated into hitler 's until the end of the second world war .
connecting across the miles slightly overwhelmed by the intensity and busyness of the encounter but looking at my surroundings with new eyes , i come to the end of the tour in a shiny mall at potsdamer platz to finally see ' bruce ' waving at me from a small screen in the window of a consumer electronics store .
according to the artists , the prime goal of the project , despite occasional hitches like the phone connection being lost , is communication .
" people here might know a lot about india and the call center boom , " said wetzel .
" but all that knowledge does n't help in countering unfair clichés if you 've never really spoken to or had a real exchange with an indian . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists need n't worry about that .
mark stuver , 30 , from san francisco , who was in berlin for the first time and did the tour with ' dawn , ' admitted he 'd exchanged phone numbers with her . " it was a bit crazy being guided in berlin all the way from india , " said stuver .

in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .
the artists were inspired by salt lake city , a booming district of glass buildings housing call centers on the outskirts of the city .
" it was a total contrast to everything else in calcutta , " said daniel wetzel , one of the artists in the group .
" it was also surreal .
suddenly the west with its money and capitalism was here and the people sitting in these buildings were pretending to be a part of it - it provided the perfect stage setting . "

naturally indian the rest of the performance was pretty much left up to them .
" there are clear limits in a call center .
we wanted to get away from that and allow the operators to improvise and bring in their own voices , " said wetzel .
" theater is all about the senses .
in this case the feeling that you 're talking to a real person is important even though it 's from a great distance . "
thus , unlike the operators in india 's booming call centers who dub themselves " john " and " sara " and adopt british and american accents to disguise their origin and put their customers in the west at ease , the calcutta call center performers sound unabashedly indian and human as they guide , flirt , play-act and even sing their way around on the tour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin david xavier -lrb- his real name -rrb- , who steers people through the northern calcutta neighborhood of hatibagan in the afternoon and through kreuzberg in the evening , said it 's all a matter of being imaginative .
" the reaction from walkers , whether in berlin or calcutta , is overwhelmingly positive , " the 39-year-old said .
" they 're surprised at the different perspectives the tour can open up about their own cities . "
more than a telephone connection there 's another twist to the surprise and weirdness of the tour - the artists have woven in the history of colonial india 's struggle for independence from the british into the kreuzberg district where the " call cutta " tour is set .

"
what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?
a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . " " have you ever lied on the phone or used a false name ? " - the unexpected question asked huskily in an indian accent over my headphones stops me in my tracks .
i 'm on a walking tour called " call cutta , " through an unfamiliar and desolate stretch of berlin 's usually vibrant kreuzberg neighborhood .
after renting a hands-free mobile set from the local hebbel theater and waiting for a call , i 'm now following instructions provided via the phone by a flirtatious guide calling himself ' bruce . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin .
for the past hour , he 's navigated me through buildings , parks , playgrounds , cellars and courtyards , fed me intriguing scraps of information on the history of the area and teased out some rather personal details . but , as i consider his latest question , i suspect bruce does it all the time .
after all , he 's never set eyes on the landscape he 's been meticulously steering me through .
what 's more , ' bruce ' is n't even his real name .
in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .

" i do n't think that people in the us and the anglo-saxon countries would be unsatisfied with a french rejection , " juncker , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said in an interview on french radio .

" i really hope that the french people can be successfully convinced that they would be making a serious mistake if this referendum fails , " schily said tuesday in berlin . germany will not hold a referendum on the constitution but will put it to a vote before parliament .

but some in germany viewed the choice as a mistake . german chancellor gerhard schröder called ratzinger 's election as roman catholic pontiff a " great honor to germany , " lauding him as a " dignified successor " of late pope john paul ii , who died 17 days ago .
" i congratulate him in the name of the government and all the citizens of his home country , " german chancellor schröder said in berlin on tuesday . german president horst köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed similar sentiments .
" that a compatriot has become pope fills us in germany with special pleasure and also a little pride , " he said in berlin .
" i 'm convinced that pope benedict xvi will continue the late pope john paul ii 's great engagement for people 's dignity and peace in the world , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler german opposition leader angela merkel , head of the christian democrats , called the election " historical . "
" that a german was elected pope is a moment of pride .
it 's an honor . "
bavarian state premier edmund stoiber of the christian socialist union said it was a " historic and singular day for bavaria and all of germany .
religious understanding bishop wolfgang huber of germany 's protestant church said he hoped that pope benedict xvi would continue cooperation between the christian churches .
the churchs ' futures lay only in ecumenical efforts , he said , as the german bishops ' conference congratulated ratzinger .
bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi waved to the crowd from the central balcony of st. peter 's basilica at the vatican on tuesday paul spiegel , the president of the jews in germany issued his congratulations as well .
" i am sure that he will intensify the successful route toward understanding between christians and jews to the benefit of both religions , " spiegel told mannheimer morgen daily . the central council of muslims in germany expressed the hope that the new pope would continue the dialogue between christians and muslims . " the cardinal was always john paul ii 's right hand and surely contributed much to the opening gaining this priority , " chairman nadeem elyas said in aachen , according to dpa .
as germans , muslims were doubly happy about ratzinger 's election , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor hubert gschwendtner of marktl am inn residents of marktl am inn , where ratzinger was born 78 years ago , were ebullient .
" i 'm implausibly happy , " hubert gschwendtner , mayor of the bavarian town , told dpa , saying he would invite the pope to visit his hometown .
he would be the first pope to visit marktl .
no reform expected but others in germany were n't enthusiastic .
" we can only hope that cardinal ratzinger does n't pursue the same course as john paul ii , " said christian weisner , a spokesman for germany 's church reform movement . the managing director head of germany 's national " kirche von unten " -lrb- church from below -rrb- group , bernd göhring , was less charitable .
" we consider ratzinger 's election a catastrophe .
i think that the current church 's course is only confirmed by this college of cardinals , " he said , adding that he did n't expect any reforms under pope benedict xvi .
" i think that even more people will turn their backs on the church .

" i congratulate him in the name of the government and all the citizens of his home country , " german chancellor schröder said in berlin on tuesday . german president horst köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- expressed similar sentiments .

it 's an honor . "

religious understanding bishop wolfgang huber of germany 's protestant church said he hoped that pope benedict xvi would continue cooperation between the christian churches .
the churchs ' futures lay only in ecumenical efforts , he said , as the german bishops ' conference congratulated ratzinger .

" i am sure that he will intensify the successful route toward understanding between christians and jews to the benefit of both religions , " spiegel told mannheimer morgen daily . the central council of muslims in germany expressed the hope that the new pope would continue the dialogue between christians and muslims . " the cardinal was always john paul ii 's right hand and surely contributed much to the opening gaining this priority , " chairman nadeem elyas said in aachen , according to dpa .
as germans , muslims were doubly happy about ratzinger 's election , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor hubert gschwendtner of marktl am inn residents of marktl am inn , where ratzinger was born 78 years ago , were ebullient .

he would be the first pope to visit marktl .
no reform expected but others in germany were n't enthusiastic .
" we can only hope that cardinal ratzinger does n't pursue the same course as john paul ii , " said christian weisner , a spokesman for germany 's church reform movement . the managing director head of germany 's national " kirche von unten " -lrb- church from below -rrb- group , bernd göhring , was less charitable .
" we consider ratzinger 's election a catastrophe .
i think that the current church 's course is only confirmed by this college of cardinals , " he said , adding that he did n't expect any reforms under pope benedict xvi .
" i think that even more people will turn their backs on the church . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eugen drewermann well-known critical paderborn theologian eugen drewermann -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was barred from teaching by the catholic chruch in 1991 , commented : " there is the fear that ratzinger will increase the divergences of the church in germany and in the world . " and theologian hans küng , another catholic critic forbidden by the vatican from teaching and a former school colleague of ratzinger called the choice a " huge disappointment " for all those focused on reform , though he said the new pope , ' like a us president " should be accorded 100 days to learn his new job . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's joseph ratzinger elected pope after initial uncertainty , white smoke rose from the chimney of the sistine chapel indicating the election of a new pope , the church 's 265th .

"
what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?
a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . " " have you ever lied on the phone or used a false name ? " - the unexpected question asked huskily in an indian accent over my headphones stops me in my tracks .
i 'm on a walking tour called " call cutta , " through an unfamiliar and desolate stretch of berlin 's usually vibrant kreuzberg neighborhood .
after renting a hands-free mobile set from the local hebbel theater and waiting for a call , i 'm now following instructions provided via the phone by a flirtatious guide calling himself ' bruce . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin .
for the past hour , he 's navigated me through buildings , parks , playgrounds , cellars and courtyards , fed me intriguing scraps of information on the history of the area and teased out some rather personal details . but , as i consider his latest question , i suspect bruce does it all the time .
after all , he 's never set eyes on the landscape he 's been meticulously steering me through .
what 's more , ' bruce ' is n't even his real name .
in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .
the artists were inspired by salt lake city , a booming district of glass buildings housing call centers on the outskirts of the city .
" it was a total contrast to everything else in calcutta , " said daniel wetzel , one of the artists in the group .
" it was also surreal .
suddenly the west with its money and capitalism was here and the people sitting in these buildings were pretending to be a part of it - it provided the perfect stage setting . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " call cutta " performers in calcutta much like siemens and other german companies who have rushed to india to take advantage of low labor costs , the artists ' outsourced ' the " call cutta " project : they hired ten people in calcutta , some of them fluent in german , set them up in a glitzy call center and trained them in a basic script detailing routes and landmarks in a neighborhood in calcutta and in berlin .

" there are clear limits in a call center .
we wanted to get away from that and allow the operators to improvise and bring in their own voices , " said wetzel .
" theater is all about the senses .
in this case the feeling that you 're talking to a real person is important even though it 's from a great distance . "
thus , unlike the operators in india 's booming call centers who dub themselves " john " and " sara " and adopt british and american accents to disguise their origin and put their customers in the west at ease , the calcutta call center performers sound unabashedly indian and human as they guide , flirt , play-act and even sing their way around on the tour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin david xavier -lrb- his real name -rrb- , who steers people through the northern calcutta neighborhood of hatibagan in the afternoon and through kreuzberg in the evening , said it 's all a matter of being imaginative .
" the reaction from walkers , whether in berlin or calcutta , is overwhelmingly positive , " the 39-year-old said .
" they 're surprised at the different perspectives the tour can open up about their own cities . "
more than a telephone connection there 's another twist to the surprise and weirdness of the tour - the artists have woven in the history of colonial india 's struggle for independence from the british into the kreuzberg district where the " call cutta " tour is set .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose thus , obediently following bruce 's instructions and feeling like i 'm on a treasure hunt , i get down on my hands and knees next to a dustbin in a park and peer underneath it to find a faded picture of subhas chandra bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a famous freedom fighter from bengal .
bose spent time between 1941 and 1943 in berlin trying to recruit hitler 's help in fighting the british .
apparently his office and the radio station " free india " he set up were once in this area . further along , to the amusement of a gaggle of neighborhood children trailing me by now , i 'm led to another hidden photograph of a striking young indian soldier , one of the many thousands who belonged to bose 's " free india " army and which was incorporated into hitler 's until the end of the second world war .
connecting across the miles slightly overwhelmed by the intensity and busyness of the encounter but looking at my surroundings with new eyes , i come to the end of the tour in a shiny mall at potsdamer platz to finally see ' bruce ' waving at me from a small screen in the window of a consumer electronics store .
according to the artists , the prime goal of the project , despite occasional hitches like the phone connection being lost , is communication .
" people here might know a lot about india and the call center boom , " said wetzel .

"
what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?
a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . " " have you ever lied on the phone or used a false name ? " - the unexpected question asked huskily in an indian accent over my headphones stops me in my tracks .
i 'm on a walking tour called " call cutta , " through an unfamiliar and desolate stretch of berlin 's usually vibrant kreuzberg neighborhood .
after renting a hands-free mobile set from the local hebbel theater and waiting for a call , i 'm now following instructions provided via the phone by a flirtatious guide calling himself ' bruce . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin .
for the past hour , he 's navigated me through buildings , parks , playgrounds , cellars and courtyards , fed me intriguing scraps of information on the history of the area and teased out some rather personal details . but , as i consider his latest question , i suspect bruce does it all the time .
after all , he 's never set eyes on the landscape he 's been meticulously steering me through .
what 's more , ' bruce ' is n't even his real name .
in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .
the artists were inspired by salt lake city , a booming district of glass buildings housing call centers on the outskirts of the city .
" it was a total contrast to everything else in calcutta , " said daniel wetzel , one of the artists in the group .
" it was also surreal .
suddenly the west with its money and capitalism was here and the people sitting in these buildings were pretending to be a part of it - it provided the perfect stage setting . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " call cutta " performers in calcutta much like siemens and other german companies who have rushed to india to take advantage of low labor costs , the artists ' outsourced ' the " call cutta " project : they hired ten people in calcutta , some of them fluent in german , set them up in a glitzy call center and trained them in a basic script detailing routes and landmarks in a neighborhood in calcutta and in berlin .
naturally indian the rest of the performance was pretty much left up to them .
" there are clear limits in a call center .
we wanted to get away from that and allow the operators to improvise and bring in their own voices , " said wetzel .
" theater is all about the senses .
in this case the feeling that you 're talking to a real person is important even though it 's from a great distance . "
thus , unlike the operators in india 's booming call centers who dub themselves " john " and " sara " and adopt british and american accents to disguise their origin and put their customers in the west at ease , the calcutta call center performers sound unabashedly indian and human as they guide , flirt , play-act and even sing their way around on the tour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin david xavier -lrb- his real name -rrb- , who steers people through the northern calcutta neighborhood of hatibagan in the afternoon and through kreuzberg in the evening , said it 's all a matter of being imaginative .
" the reaction from walkers , whether in berlin or calcutta , is overwhelmingly positive , " the 39-year-old said .
" they 're surprised at the different perspectives the tour can open up about their own cities . "
more than a telephone connection there 's another twist to the surprise and weirdness of the tour - the artists have woven in the history of colonial india 's struggle for independence from the british into the kreuzberg district where the " call cutta " tour is set .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose thus , obediently following bruce 's instructions and feeling like i 'm on a treasure hunt , i get down on my hands and knees next to a dustbin in a park and peer underneath it to find a faded picture of subhas chandra bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a famous freedom fighter from bengal .
bose spent time between 1941 and 1943 in berlin trying to recruit hitler 's help in fighting the british .
apparently his office and the radio station " free india " he set up were once in this area . further along , to the amusement of a gaggle of neighborhood children trailing me by now , i 'm led to another hidden photograph of a striking young indian soldier , one of the many thousands who belonged to bose 's " free india " army and which was incorporated into hitler 's until the end of the second world war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 germany 's media struggle with migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's missing in germany is an awareness of every-day migrant life even though some 7.3 million foreigners currently live in germany , migrant life still gets a bad rap in the media .
public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches . if german television is anything to go by , muslim life is still shackled by tradition and overshadowed by crime .
its image took an even steeper downward plunge after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , said fritz pleitgen , director of german public broadcaster wdr . but migrant life is n't all bad news , he insisted - and it 's high time television delivered the broader picture . melting pot germany " honor killings and arranged marriages make more of a splash in the media that differentiated depictions of normal life among migrants , " pleitgen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asli bayram was crowned miss germany 2005 he 'd rather see more coverage of upbeat news about the country 's minorities - like german-turkish director fatih akin winning the golden bear at the berlin film festival and asli bayram -lrb- photo -rrb- scooping this year 's miss germany title . after all , contemporary germany is increasing becoming a proverbial melting pot .
cultural borders have never been more blurred - one in six marriages is inter-cultural and one in four children born in germany has at least one non-german parent . remaining objective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the other hand , gang violence , honor killings and the sort of muslim fundamentalism practiced , for example , by the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who is now standing trial in istanbul after germany extradited him last year , are also a fact of modern life . but it needs to be stressed that these cases are exceptions , said marie-luise beck , a government expert on migration .
at a time when economic problems are creating wide-scale insecurity and resentment , society tends to look for scape-goats , she observed . " it 's important to report on what 's happening , " she said .
" the media has a duty to cover an inflammatory speech given by an imam .
but it 's equally important to report of the rise of right-wing extremism and show that it does n't only take the form of jackboots , it can also come packaged in a pin-stripe suit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an approach that can easily depoliticize extremism .
beck said that instead of exploring the roots of right-wing fanaticism , the media tends to promote a stereotypical image of shaven-headed nazis in bomber jackets which fails to convey the full extent of the problem - and the rise of middle-class reactionaries . beate winkler from the european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia also had reservations about the way the media portrays right-wing extremism . " right-wing extremists are turned into victims to such an extent that viewers can identify with them , " she said .
" at the same time no one really looks at their broader social role . " " why ca n't we take them as they are ? " so what can be done to encourage more objective reporting ?
while many feel that germany 's public broadcasters should assume an educational responsibility by depicting positive examples of integration , others caution against taking an over-optimistic approach . " people are always saying television should show more good news , " said ulrich deppendorf from wdr .
" but if we only ever showed positive images , we 'd lost some of our credibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to media expert rainer braun , the problem is that migrants still have n't hit the mainstream . " why is it so hard to have people from other backgrounds fronting any thing other than specifically multi-cultural shows ? " he asked .
" why could n't they read the prime-time news or host political shows - why ca n't we just take them as they are ? " cem say -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de being turkish and gay in germany germany may be considered a tolerant place for homosexuals .
but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality .
-lrb- sept .
25 , 2004 -rrb- breaking the mold turkey 's bid for eu membership might still be a touch-and-go issue , but a look at germany ’ s cultural mainstream shows that the country ’ s turkish community has never been more visible .
-lrb- aug .
12 , 2004 -rrb- when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .
but how deep does the concept of honor run among some immigrant communities ?

the system is intended to replace patriot missiles in the united states and germany , and nike hercules missiles in italy . but for green party chief reinhard bütikofer , there are still some reservations with regard to the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer " it was n't easy at all for us , " bütikofer said in berlin on monday , adding that his party , with its deeply pacifist roots , had decided to reluctantly throw their weight behind it after considering the project in its entirety .
at the same time he said his party continued to have misgivings about the concrete military need for the project as well as the costs involved . reservations remain the us , germany and italy are funding meads in shares of 58 percent , 25 percent and 17 percent respectively .
for germany alone , this amounts to 886 million euros -lrb- $ 1,154 million -rrb- over a period of eight years .
more costs could follow . germany ’ s greens are worried that the costs involved in the missile defense project could balloon out of control .
but despite their concerns , green party leaders have decided that they do not want to risk a dispute within the coalition government .
that 's why they 've recommended that the green parliamentary group vote in favor of germany 's involvement in the project . chancellor schröder 's ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are happy with this development .
spd party chair franz münterfering is now reassured ahead of parliament 's budgetary committee meeting later this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering münterfering said he expects wednesday 's vote to be in favor of the meads project . " it is also a question of germany 's reliability , " he said .
" we never had any doubt that this should be possible , and we are pleased that we can now come to this decision . " reliability at stake the need for germany to be seen as reliable by its ally , the united states , was one of the social democrats ’ primary arguments for supporting the meads project – which is the largest transatlantic missile defense system .
the greens seem to have accepted this argument , but by way of compromise they are insisting that other defense costs be reduced . on tuesday , the greens are expected to signal their support for the meads project within the bundestag lower house of parliament .
when the budgetary committee gives its approval as expected on wednesday , the german government can finally confirm its long-awaited participation in the transatlantic defense system . nina werkhäuser -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meads defense system in the firing line ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible .

bavarian cardinal joseph ratzinger became the 265th pope . germany 's joseph ratzinger was elected pope for the world 's one billion catholics on tuesday evening .
he chose the name benedict xvi .
the new pontiff briefly addressed the hundreds of thousands of catholics gathered at st. peter 's square from a balcony on st. peter 's basilica .
" dear brothers and sisters , after the great pope john paul ii the cardinals have elected me a simple and humble laborer in the vineyard of the lord , " he said , paying tribute to his predecessor .
the throngs of catholics filling the square had greeted with cheers smoke - which first appeared black , but then turned white - spewed from the chimney of the sistine chapel around 6 p.m.
-lrb- 1600 utc -rrb- to signal the cardinals had reached a two-thirds majority .
after a few minutes , the bells of st. peter 's basilica began pealing , confirming the election of a new pope .
soon after , ratzinger appeared on the balcony to the gleeful cheers of the thousands that had gathered .
in germany , a crowd began to gather in the pouring rain in regensburg , where the new pope was a longtime university professor .
bildunterschrift : priests celebrated as white smoke billowed from the chimney of the sistine chapel at the vatican , on tuesday ratzinger is considered one of the catholic church 's most powerful and most orthodox clergymen .
but it was n't always that way .

but that changed when pope john paul ii was elected in 1978 , ratzinger - made a cardinal in 1977 - quickly developed into his right-hand man .
the two shared similar conservative views against women in the church , abortion and pregnancy counseling centers .
he once called abortion a " culture of death . "
ratzinger also squabbled with three german cardinals in 1994 about divorcees being allowed to marry again in the church .
bildunterschrift : tourists wave the vatican and german flags as they celebrate in st. peter 's square at the vatican following the election of the new pope german politicians lined up to praise the new pope , the first from germany in over 480 years .
" i congratulate him heartily in the name of the german government and all the citizens of his home country germany , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said . at 78 , experts consider him a " transition pope " who wo n't hold the title as long as his predecessor john paul ii , who was pope for 26 years .
after being tucked away in secret conclaves in the sistine chapel on monday , the 115 cardinals of the conclave voted three times before coming to agreement on the new pope .

bavarian cardinal joseph ratzinger became the 265th pope . germany 's joseph ratzinger was elected pope for the world 's one billion catholics on tuesday evening .
he chose the name benedict xvi .
the new pontiff briefly addressed the hundreds of thousands of catholics gathered at st. peter 's square from a balcony on st. peter 's basilica .
" dear brothers and sisters , after the great pope john paul ii the cardinals have elected me a simple and humble laborer in the vineyard of the lord , " he said , paying tribute to his predecessor .
the throngs of catholics filling the square had greeted with cheers smoke - which first appeared black , but then turned white - spewed from the chimney of the sistine chapel around 6 p.m.
-lrb- 1600 utc -rrb- to signal the cardinals had reached a two-thirds majority .
after a few minutes , the bells of st. peter 's basilica began pealing , confirming the election of a new pope .
soon after , ratzinger appeared on the balcony to the gleeful cheers of the thousands that had gathered .
in germany , a crowd began to gather in the pouring rain in regensburg , where the new pope was a longtime university professor .
bildunterschrift : priests celebrated as white smoke billowed from the chimney of the sistine chapel at the vatican , on tuesday ratzinger is considered one of the catholic church 's most powerful and most orthodox clergymen .
but it was n't always that way .

the two shared similar conservative views against women in the church , abortion and pregnancy counseling centers .
he once called abortion a " culture of death . "
ratzinger also squabbled with three german cardinals in 1994 about divorcees being allowed to marry again in the church .
bildunterschrift : tourists wave the vatican and german flags as they celebrate in st. peter 's square at the vatican following the election of the new pope german politicians lined up to praise the new pope , the first from germany in over 480 years .
" i congratulate him heartily in the name of the german government and all the citizens of his home country germany , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said . at 78 , experts consider him a " transition pope " who wo n't hold the title as long as his predecessor john paul ii , who was pope for 26 years .
after being tucked away in secret conclaves in the sistine chapel on monday , the 115 cardinals of the conclave voted three times before coming to agreement on the new pope .
the vote is considered to have been one of the fastest in history . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from a small bavarian town to the papacy if his past statements are any indication , pope benedict xvi will continue to tread the conservative line that was among the defining characteristics of his predecessors long reign .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 germany 's media struggle with migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's missing in germany is an awareness of every-day migrant life even though some 7.3 million foreigners currently live in germany , migrant life still gets a bad rap in the media .
public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches . if german television is anything to go by , muslim life is still shackled by tradition and overshadowed by crime .
its image took an even steeper downward plunge after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , said fritz pleitgen , director of german public broadcaster wdr . but migrant life is n't all bad news , he insisted - and it 's high time television delivered the broader picture . melting pot germany " honor killings and arranged marriages make more of a splash in the media that differentiated depictions of normal life among migrants , " pleitgen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asli bayram was crowned miss germany 2005 he 'd rather see more coverage of upbeat news about the country 's minorities - like german-turkish director fatih akin winning the golden bear at the berlin film festival and asli bayram -lrb- photo -rrb- scooping this year 's miss germany title . after all , contemporary germany is increasing becoming a proverbial melting pot .
cultural borders have never been more blurred - one in six marriages is inter-cultural and one in four children born in germany has at least one non-german parent . remaining objective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the other hand , gang violence , honor killings and the sort of muslim fundamentalism practiced , for example , by the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who is now standing trial in istanbul after germany extradited him last year , are also a fact of modern life . but it needs to be stressed that these cases are exceptions , said marie-luise beck , a government expert on migration .
at a time when economic problems are creating wide-scale insecurity and resentment , society tends to look for scape-goats , she observed . " it 's important to report on what 's happening , " she said .
" the media has a duty to cover an inflammatory speech given by an imam .
but it 's equally important to report of the rise of right-wing extremism and show that it does n't only take the form of jackboots , it can also come packaged in a pin-stripe suit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an approach that can easily depoliticize extremism .
beck said that instead of exploring the roots of right-wing fanaticism , the media tends to promote a stereotypical image of shaven-headed nazis in bomber jackets which fails to convey the full extent of the problem - and the rise of middle-class reactionaries . beate winkler from the european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia also had reservations about the way the media portrays right-wing extremism . " right-wing extremists are turned into victims to such an extent that viewers can identify with them , " she said .
" at the same time no one really looks at their broader social role . " " why ca n't we take them as they are ? " so what can be done to encourage more objective reporting ?
while many feel that germany 's public broadcasters should assume an educational responsibility by depicting positive examples of integration , others caution against taking an over-optimistic approach . " people are always saying television should show more good news , " said ulrich deppendorf from wdr .
" but if we only ever showed positive images , we 'd lost some of our credibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to media expert rainer braun , the problem is that migrants still have n't hit the mainstream . " why is it so hard to have people from other backgrounds fronting any thing other than specifically multi-cultural shows ? " he asked .
" why could n't they read the prime-time news or host political shows - why ca n't we just take them as they are ? " cem say -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de being turkish and gay in germany germany may be considered a tolerant place for homosexuals .
but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality .
-lrb- sept .
25 , 2004 -rrb- breaking the mold turkey 's bid for eu membership might still be a touch-and-go issue , but a look at germany ’ s cultural mainstream shows that the country ’ s turkish community has never been more visible .

bavarian cardinal joseph ratzinger became the 265th pope . germany 's joseph ratzinger was elected pope for the world 's one billion catholics on tuesday evening .
he chose the name benedict xvi .
the new pontiff briefly addressed the hundreds of thousands of catholics gathered at st. peter 's square from a balcony on st. peter 's basilica .
" dear brothers and sisters , after the great pope john paul ii the cardinals have elected me a simple and humble laborer in the vineyard of the lord , " he said , paying tribute to his predecessor .
the throngs of catholics filling the square had greeted with cheers smoke - which first appeared black , but then turned white - spewed from the chimney of the sistine chapel around 6 p.m.
-lrb- 1600 utc -rrb- to signal the cardinals had reached a two-thirds majority .
after a few minutes , the bells of st. peter 's basilica began pealing , confirming the election of a new pope .
soon after , ratzinger appeared on the balcony to the gleeful cheers of the thousands that had gathered .
in germany , a crowd began to gather in the pouring rain in regensburg , where the new pope was a longtime university professor .
bildunterschrift : priests celebrated as white smoke billowed from the chimney of the sistine chapel at the vatican , on tuesday ratzinger is considered one of the catholic church 's most powerful and most orthodox clergymen .
but it was n't always that way .
as a young man in bavaria , caught up in the reform-fervor that accompanied the 1960s student revolts , ratzinger was known as someone to support reforms in the church .
but that changed when pope john paul ii was elected in 1978 , ratzinger - made a cardinal in 1977 - quickly developed into his right-hand man .
the two shared similar conservative views against women in the church , abortion and pregnancy counseling centers .
he once called abortion a " culture of death . "
ratzinger also squabbled with three german cardinals in 1994 about divorcees being allowed to marry again in the church .
bildunterschrift : tourists wave the vatican and german flags as they celebrate in st. peter 's square at the vatican following the election of the new pope german politicians lined up to praise the new pope , the first from germany in over 480 years .
" i congratulate him heartily in the name of the german government and all the citizens of his home country germany , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said . at 78 , experts consider him a " transition pope " who wo n't hold the title as long as his predecessor john paul ii , who was pope for 26 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 germany 's media struggle with migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's missing in germany is an awareness of every-day migrant life even though some 7.3 million foreigners currently live in germany , migrant life still gets a bad rap in the media .
public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches . if german television is anything to go by , muslim life is still shackled by tradition and overshadowed by crime .
its image took an even steeper downward plunge after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , said fritz pleitgen , director of german public broadcaster wdr . but migrant life is n't all bad news , he insisted - and it 's high time television delivered the broader picture . melting pot germany " honor killings and arranged marriages make more of a splash in the media that differentiated depictions of normal life among migrants , " pleitgen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asli bayram was crowned miss germany 2005 he 'd rather see more coverage of upbeat news about the country 's minorities - like german-turkish director fatih akin winning the golden bear at the berlin film festival and asli bayram -lrb- photo -rrb- scooping this year 's miss germany title . after all , contemporary germany is increasing becoming a proverbial melting pot .
cultural borders have never been more blurred - one in six marriages is inter-cultural and one in four children born in germany has at least one non-german parent . remaining objective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the other hand , gang violence , honor killings and the sort of muslim fundamentalism practiced , for example , by the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who is now standing trial in istanbul after germany extradited him last year , are also a fact of modern life . but it needs to be stressed that these cases are exceptions , said marie-luise beck , a government expert on migration .
at a time when economic problems are creating wide-scale insecurity and resentment , society tends to look for scape-goats , she observed . " it 's important to report on what 's happening , " she said .
" the media has a duty to cover an inflammatory speech given by an imam .
but it 's equally important to report of the rise of right-wing extremism and show that it does n't only take the form of jackboots , it can also come packaged in a pin-stripe suit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an approach that can easily depoliticize extremism .
beck said that instead of exploring the roots of right-wing fanaticism , the media tends to promote a stereotypical image of shaven-headed nazis in bomber jackets which fails to convey the full extent of the problem - and the rise of middle-class reactionaries . beate winkler from the european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia also had reservations about the way the media portrays right-wing extremism . " right-wing extremists are turned into victims to such an extent that viewers can identify with them , " she said .
" at the same time no one really looks at their broader social role . " " why ca n't we take them as they are ? " so what can be done to encourage more objective reporting ?
while many feel that germany 's public broadcasters should assume an educational responsibility by depicting positive examples of integration , others caution against taking an over-optimistic approach . " people are always saying television should show more good news , " said ulrich deppendorf from wdr .
" but if we only ever showed positive images , we 'd lost some of our credibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to media expert rainer braun , the problem is that migrants still have n't hit the mainstream . " why is it so hard to have people from other backgrounds fronting any thing other than specifically multi-cultural shows ? " he asked .
" why could n't they read the prime-time news or host political shows - why ca n't we just take them as they are ?

" there has n't been a coherent wall concept so far , just remains of the wall scattered over the city - a double row of cobblestones in some places to mark the former border and a few disparate signs and plaques on the wall victims , ” dominique krüssen of the berlin senate for culture told dw-world last year .

13 . , 2002 , the 41st anniversary of the building of the berlin wall .
flierl 's plan foresees building upon the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , the scene of several escape attempts during the cold war .
at present , about 70 meters of the former border strip have been bracketed off into two seven-meter high steel walls .
visitors can peer through slits in the hinterland wall into the empty death strip . however , the bernauer strasse memorial remains largely ignored by the hordes of daily tourists who prefer to flock to the more commercially-successful checkpoint charlie - the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin 's most famous cold war symbol . flierl hopes to change that by injecting some authenticity into the rather bleak landscape by transporting some further real pieces of the wall to the area . " no hollywood-like rebuilding " in addition , his plan envisions using the remains of the front and secondary wall scattered around on the scruffy parks in the area between the bernauer strasse , the nordbahnhof railway station and the mauerpark and combining it with some multimedia features such as video bus tours and electronic audio guides to give visitors a real feel of the horrors of the death strip . however flierl made clear that a " a hollywood-like rebuilding of the wall as a trivialized theme park " was definitely not on the cards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men read the letters , names of victims of the berlin-wall , of wooden crosses , standing next to a re-erected strip of the former berlin wall near checkpoint charlie in berlin on oct .
31 , 2004 .
the comment was directed at the controversial rebuilding of the wall at checkpoint charlie and a memorial with wooden crosses in memory of the wall victims erected by alexandra hildebrandt , head of the checkpoint charlie museum . the berlin senate for culture has been wrangling with hildebrandt for months over the controversial exhibit .
a local court has now ordered its removal .
flierl 's latest plans include erecting an " information pavilion " on the area . historians slam plan however , flierl 's plans , in particular his refusal to reconstruct old watch towers and security barriers near the bernauer strasse , also triggered criticism on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the august 17 , 1962 photo shows dying peter fechter carried away by east german border guards who shot him down when he tried to flee to the west .
klaus-dieter henke , historian at the university of dresden said the blueprint hardly mentioned the political actors who " deprived the people of freedom through cement and guns . " manfred wilke , head of the research group on the communist regime at berlin 's free university said the plan utterly lacked shedding light on the perpetrators and the historical context . " the words ' fleeing from the gdr ' does n't make an appearance in the paper at all , " wilke said .
" but , that 's what the people associate with the wall . " question mark over finances others have more immediate concerns .
alice ströver , the education expert of the local green party warned that the undertaking could end in naught if it 's too ambitious to start with and involves too many memorials at disparate sites . most importantly , there 's no mention as yet of what the whole project would cost and where the money will come - not an unimportant matter in a broke city . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trivializing the wall as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie .

you might when you hear that at least he 's unlikely to stray .
a new study has revealed that overweight men are more likely to remain faithful to their partners . when german health institute epicure questioned some 1,000 men between 31 and 69 about their sexuality , it discovered that one in five men fantasizes about having an affair .
but the heavier he gets , the less likely he is to fancy a fling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so despite his obvious advantages , a man with six-pack abs does have his flaws . the impotence issue " the more you weigh , the less you 'll feel like sexual dalliances , " said sascha rusch from epicure . but do fat men just have fewer opportunities for hanky panky , or is their sex drive really lower ?
apparently so .
seven percent of men enjoy sex with prostitutes , in comparison to just four percent of overweight men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low self-confidence is partly to blame , but rusch pointed out that the main reason is more likely to be lack of exercise and bad diet . " only 44 percent of men believe in eating healthily , " he said .
" but there 's an immediate connection between obesity and impotence . " social standing if even getting up off the couch seems like an effort , bedroom frolics are probably the last thing on a man 's mind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the study also showed that 75 percent of men are willing to tackle lack of energy with regular sport - even if they do n't necessarily do so for the benefit of their better halves .
four of five men said they lead a healthy lifestyle in order to live longer and feel better , 55 per cent of them say they hope personal fitness will improve their self-confidence , while only 27 percent of the respondents said they worked out in order to appear more attractive . " ego tends to be the main motivation , " rusch said . even so , the older a man is , the more he earns and the better his education , the more effort he 'll put in to pleasing his partner . whatever the reasons , we now know that fat men are faithful .

but the changing political situation in germany kept him from his goal for a short time .
his father , a former police officer , quit the force in 1937 rather than join the national socialist party .
ratzinger , who was in school at that point , was forced to join hitler youth , like all other boys .
the revelation made headlines last weekend after the sunday times of london reported it .
but ratzinger had stated often that he fled the organization as soon as he was no longer forced to go .
earnest and intellectual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger celebrating mass in the mountains of ruhpolding , southern germany , in 1952 he was a serious student and very rational , traits that would accompany him all through his life and into the clergy .
an intellectual , he became a university professor in 1958 .
ratzinger 's career in theological academia lasted until march 1977 , when he was named the archbishop of munich and friesing .
a few months later , on june 27 , he was elevated to cardinal .
after john paul ii began his reign in 1978 , it did n't take long for ratzinger to gain his favor .
the two shared conservative views on abortion , pregnancy counseling and women in the church .
the bavarian was appointed prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in november 1981 .
ratzinger , the most influential cardinal under john paul ii , spoke out against abortion many times , calling it a " culture of death . "
he also shared his pope 's rejection of the us decision to go to war in iraq .
dismayed moderates as leader of the congregation of the doctrine of the faith , ratzinger delighted the more conservative wing of the church and dismayed moderates and church reformers , who have strong backing in his home country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi , in 1982 , when he was archbishop of munich throughout the 1980s he disciplined latin american " liberation " theologists , who posit that the church should draw its strength from political activism relating to the poor .
in 1992 , leonard boff , one of the leading thinkers in this movement resigned his priesthood writing in a letter that the papacy of john paul ii was " cruel and without mercy . "
hints at future during mass as pope john paul ii neared death , ratzinger remained his most trusted servant and carried out his duties in his stead .
at the mass preceding the conclave to select a new pope , ratzinger gave a moving performance , surprising many vatican observers who knew him as a serious , quiet man .
he left no doubt as to where he stood .
" we are moving towards a dictatorship of relativism , which does not recognize anything definitive and has as its highest value one 's own ego and one 's own desires , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de everyone 's wild about " ratzy " britney 's got hundreds , cher 's got her share .

the system is intended to replace patriot missiles in the united states and germany , and nike hercules missiles in italy . but for green party chief reinhard bütikofer , there are still some reservations with regard to the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer " it was n't easy at all for us , " bütikofer said in berlin on monday , adding that his party , with its deeply pacifist roots , had decided to reluctantly throw their weight behind it after considering the project in its entirety .
at the same time he said his party continued to have misgivings about the concrete military need for the project as well as the costs involved . reservations remain the us , germany and italy are funding meads in shares of 58 percent , 25 percent and 17 percent respectively .
for germany alone , this amounts to 886 million euros -lrb- $ 1,154 million -rrb- over a period of eight years .
more costs could follow . germany ’ s greens are worried that the costs involved in the missile defense project could balloon out of control .
but despite their concerns , green party leaders have decided that they do not want to risk a dispute within the coalition government .
that 's why they 've recommended that the green parliamentary group vote in favor of germany 's involvement in the project . chancellor schröder 's ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are happy with this development .
spd party chair franz münterfering is now reassured ahead of parliament 's budgetary committee meeting later this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering münterfering said he expects wednesday 's vote to be in favor of the meads project . " it is also a question of germany 's reliability , " he said .
" we never had any doubt that this should be possible , and we are pleased that we can now come to this decision . " reliability at stake the need for germany to be seen as reliable by its ally , the united states , was one of the social democrats ’ primary arguments for supporting the meads project – which is the largest transatlantic missile defense system .
the greens seem to have accepted this argument , but by way of compromise they are insisting that other defense costs be reduced . on tuesday , the greens are expected to signal their support for the meads project within the bundestag lower house of parliament .
when the budgetary committee gives its approval as expected on wednesday , the german government can finally confirm its long-awaited participation in the transatlantic defense system . nina werkhäuser -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de meads defense system in the firing line ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 germany 's media struggle with migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's missing in germany is an awareness of every-day migrant life even though some 7.3 million foreigners currently live in germany , migrant life still gets a bad rap in the media .
public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches . if german television is anything to go by , muslim life is still shackled by tradition and overshadowed by crime .
its image took an even steeper downward plunge after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , said fritz pleitgen , director of german public broadcaster wdr . but migrant life is n't all bad news , he insisted - and it 's high time television delivered the broader picture . melting pot germany " honor killings and arranged marriages make more of a splash in the media that differentiated depictions of normal life among migrants , " pleitgen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asli bayram was crowned miss germany 2005 he 'd rather see more coverage of upbeat news about the country 's minorities - like german-turkish director fatih akin winning the golden bear at the berlin film festival and asli bayram -lrb- photo -rrb- scooping this year 's miss germany title . after all , contemporary germany is increasing becoming a proverbial melting pot .
cultural borders have never been more blurred - one in six marriages is inter-cultural and one in four children born in germany has at least one non-german parent . remaining objective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the other hand , gang violence , honor killings and the sort of muslim fundamentalism practiced , for example , by the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who is now standing trial in istanbul after germany extradited him last year , are also a fact of modern life . but it needs to be stressed that these cases are exceptions , said marie-luise beck , a government expert on migration .
at a time when economic problems are creating wide-scale insecurity and resentment , society tends to look for scape-goats , she observed . " it 's important to report on what 's happening , " she said .
" the media has a duty to cover an inflammatory speech given by an imam .
but it 's equally important to report of the rise of right-wing extremism and show that it does n't only take the form of jackboots , it can also come packaged in a pin-stripe suit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an approach that can easily depoliticize extremism .
beck said that instead of exploring the roots of right-wing fanaticism , the media tends to promote a stereotypical image of shaven-headed nazis in bomber jackets which fails to convey the full extent of the problem - and the rise of middle-class reactionaries . beate winkler from the european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia also had reservations about the way the media portrays right-wing extremism . " right-wing extremists are turned into victims to such an extent that viewers can identify with them , " she said .
" at the same time no one really looks at their broader social role . " " why ca n't we take them as they are ? " so what can be done to encourage more objective reporting ?
while many feel that germany 's public broadcasters should assume an educational responsibility by depicting positive examples of integration , others caution against taking an over-optimistic approach . " people are always saying television should show more good news , " said ulrich deppendorf from wdr .
" but if we only ever showed positive images , we 'd lost some of our credibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to media expert rainer braun , the problem is that migrants still have n't hit the mainstream . " why is it so hard to have people from other backgrounds fronting any thing other than specifically multi-cultural shows ? " he asked .
" why could n't they read the prime-time news or host political shows - why ca n't we just take them as they are ? " cem say -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de being turkish and gay in germany germany may be considered a tolerant place for homosexuals .
but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality .
-lrb- sept .
25 , 2004 -rrb- breaking the mold turkey 's bid for eu membership might still be a touch-and-go issue , but a look at germany ’ s cultural mainstream shows that the country ’ s turkish community has never been more visible .

at the same time he said his party continued to have misgivings about the concrete military need for the project as well as the costs involved . reservations remain the us , germany and italy are funding meads in shares of 58 percent , 25 percent and 17 percent respectively .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 germany 's media struggle with migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's missing in germany is an awareness of every-day migrant life even though some 7.3 million foreigners currently live in germany , migrant life still gets a bad rap in the media .
public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches . if german television is anything to go by , muslim life is still shackled by tradition and overshadowed by crime .
its image took an even steeper downward plunge after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , said fritz pleitgen , director of german public broadcaster wdr . but migrant life is n't all bad news , he insisted - and it 's high time television delivered the broader picture . melting pot germany " honor killings and arranged marriages make more of a splash in the media that differentiated depictions of normal life among migrants , " pleitgen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asli bayram was crowned miss germany 2005 he 'd rather see more coverage of upbeat news about the country 's minorities - like german-turkish director fatih akin winning the golden bear at the berlin film festival and asli bayram -lrb- photo -rrb- scooping this year 's miss germany title . after all , contemporary germany is increasing becoming a proverbial melting pot .
cultural borders have never been more blurred - one in six marriages is inter-cultural and one in four children born in germany has at least one non-german parent . remaining objective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the other hand , gang violence , honor killings and the sort of muslim fundamentalism practiced , for example , by the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who is now standing trial in istanbul after germany extradited him last year , are also a fact of modern life . but it needs to be stressed that these cases are exceptions , said marie-luise beck , a government expert on migration .
at a time when economic problems are creating wide-scale insecurity and resentment , society tends to look for scape-goats , she observed . " it 's important to report on what 's happening , " she said .
" the media has a duty to cover an inflammatory speech given by an imam .
but it 's equally important to report of the rise of right-wing extremism and show that it does n't only take the form of jackboots , it can also come packaged in a pin-stripe suit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an approach that can easily depoliticize extremism .
beck said that instead of exploring the roots of right-wing fanaticism , the media tends to promote a stereotypical image of shaven-headed nazis in bomber jackets which fails to convey the full extent of the problem - and the rise of middle-class reactionaries . beate winkler from the european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia also had reservations about the way the media portrays right-wing extremism . " right-wing extremists are turned into victims to such an extent that viewers can identify with them , " she said .
" at the same time no one really looks at their broader social role . " " why ca n't we take them as they are ? " so what can be done to encourage more objective reporting ?
while many feel that germany 's public broadcasters should assume an educational responsibility by depicting positive examples of integration , others caution against taking an over-optimistic approach . " people are always saying television should show more good news , " said ulrich deppendorf from wdr .
" but if we only ever showed positive images , we 'd lost some of our credibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to media expert rainer braun , the problem is that migrants still have n't hit the mainstream . " why is it so hard to have people from other backgrounds fronting any thing other than specifically multi-cultural shows ? " he asked .
" why could n't they read the prime-time news or host political shows - why ca n't we just take them as they are ?

you might when you hear that at least he 's unlikely to stray .
a new study has revealed that overweight men are more likely to remain faithful to their partners . when german health institute epicure questioned some 1,000 men between 31 and 69 about their sexuality , it discovered that one in five men fantasizes about having an affair .
but the heavier he gets , the less likely he is to fancy a fling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so despite his obvious advantages , a man with six-pack abs does have his flaws . the impotence issue " the more you weigh , the less you 'll feel like sexual dalliances , " said sascha rusch from epicure . but do fat men just have fewer opportunities for hanky panky , or is their sex drive really lower ?
apparently so .
seven percent of men enjoy sex with prostitutes , in comparison to just four percent of overweight men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low self-confidence is partly to blame , but rusch pointed out that the main reason is more likely to be lack of exercise and bad diet . " only 44 percent of men believe in eating healthily , " he said .
" but there 's an immediate connection between obesity and impotence . " social standing if even getting up off the couch seems like an effort , bedroom frolics are probably the last thing on a man 's mind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the study also showed that 75 percent of men are willing to tackle lack of energy with regular sport - even if they do n't necessarily do so for the benefit of their better halves .
four of five men said they lead a healthy lifestyle in order to live longer and feel better , 55 per cent of them say they hope personal fitness will improve their self-confidence , while only 27 percent of the respondents said they worked out in order to appear more attractive . " ego tends to be the main motivation , " rusch said . even so , the older a man is , the more he earns and the better his education , the more effort he 'll put in to pleasing his partner . whatever the reasons , we now know that fat men are faithful .

" i do n't think that people in the us and the anglo-saxon countries would be unsatisfied with a french rejection , " juncker , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said in an interview on french radio . " that would in fact correspond with their idea of europe as one that 's weakened , because it would mean giving up the most noble of its ambitions for the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker is worried about the french referendum .
juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the us and other anglo-saxon countries had no sympathy for " the idea of a constitution , for this strengthening of europe , " and they did n't want europe as " a completely responsible and competent player " on the world stage . juncker 's comments come at a time of growing concern in france and elsewhere in on the continent that a french " non " to the treaty would effectively throw the entire european integration process into disarray . drawn up by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , the constitution is meant to simplify decision-making in the european union but it must first be adopted by all 25 member states . six weeks before the planned french referendum on may 29 , opinion polls show 55 percent support for ' no ' with 45 percent backing the document . vote sparks infighting in government inside france , rejecting the constitution would gravely undermine the standing of president jacques chirac 's government .
but it would also set off a bitter internal war among the socialists , whose leadership is campaigning in favor of the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac during his television appearance in an attempt to lobby support for the eu constitution hopes that chirac could revitalize the fortunes of the ' yes ' camp in a two-hour appearance before a group of 80 young people have come to nothing .
chirac said during the television debate on thursday that he will not personally resign if the constitution is rejected by the electorate , but the dismissal of a prime minister is the standard way for a french president to extricate himself from political difficulties . on tuesday there were clear signals that prime minister jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- will lose his job if opponents of the text win the referendum .
tensions over the continuing failure of the government 's " yes " campaign spilled over at a weekly ministerial breakfast meeting with what officials described as a " very violent argument " between raffarin and interior minister dominique de villepin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- was reportedly furious about remarks made by villepin in a radio interview sunday that were openly critical of the way the government has handled the run-up to the may 29 vote and hinted at the prime minister 's approaching replacement . concerns in germany meanwhile , politicians in germany seemed alarmed at the consequences for europe of a french rejection . german interior minister otto schily warned that a french ' no ' would also be a serious setback for european home affairs and justice policies .
" i really hope that the french people can be successfully convinced that they would be making a serious mistake if this referendum fails , " schily said tuesday in berlin . germany will not hold a referendum on the constitution but will put it to a vote before parliament .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , is set to ratify the treaty on may 12 - ahead of the french referendum - to give its neighbor a boost .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is expected to rubber-stamp it a few weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer , however , put a brave face on the french crisis on monday . " i firmly believe that france , despite the current opinion polls , will vote ' yes ' , " he told handelsblatt business daily .
fischer said that france 's approval of the first eu constitution was crucial as " the founding nation of the european union . " the green party politician said the only alternative to allowing the treaty to come into force would be to revert to the 2000 treaty of nice , which eu leaders have described as a recipe for deadlock in an expanding bloc . " it is an illusion to think one could reopen the constitutional package and renegotiate it .

you might when you hear that at least he 's unlikely to stray .
a new study has revealed that overweight men are more likely to remain faithful to their partners . when german health institute epicure questioned some 1,000 men between 31 and 69 about their sexuality , it discovered that one in five men fantasizes about having an affair .
but the heavier he gets , the less likely he is to fancy a fling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so despite his obvious advantages , a man with six-pack abs does have his flaws . the impotence issue " the more you weigh , the less you 'll feel like sexual dalliances , " said sascha rusch from epicure . but do fat men just have fewer opportunities for hanky panky , or is their sex drive really lower ?
apparently so .
seven percent of men enjoy sex with prostitutes , in comparison to just four percent of overweight men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low self-confidence is partly to blame , but rusch pointed out that the main reason is more likely to be lack of exercise and bad diet . " only 44 percent of men believe in eating healthily , " he said .
" but there 's an immediate connection between obesity and impotence . " social standing if even getting up off the couch seems like an effort , bedroom frolics are probably the last thing on a man 's mind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the study also showed that 75 percent of men are willing to tackle lack of energy with regular sport - even if they do n't necessarily do so for the benefit of their better halves .
four of five men said they lead a healthy lifestyle in order to live longer and feel better , 55 per cent of them say they hope personal fitness will improve their self-confidence , while only 27 percent of the respondents said they worked out in order to appear more attractive . " ego tends to be the main motivation , " rusch said . even so , the older a man is , the more he earns and the better his education , the more effort he 'll put in to pleasing his partner . whatever the reasons , we now know that fat men are faithful .

" there has n't been a coherent wall concept so far , just remains of the wall scattered over the city - a double row of cobblestones in some places to mark the former border and a few disparate signs and plaques on the wall victims , ” dominique krüssen of the berlin senate for culture told dw-world last year .
" it probably was a mistake to tear it down to such a large extent in the early 1990s . " expanding official memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin visitors look through the wall at bernauer strasse on aug .
13 . , 2002 , the 41st anniversary of the building of the berlin wall .
flierl 's plan foresees building upon the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , the scene of several escape attempts during the cold war .
at present , about 70 meters of the former border strip have been bracketed off into two seven-meter high steel walls .
visitors can peer through slits in the hinterland wall into the empty death strip . however , the bernauer strasse memorial remains largely ignored by the hordes of daily tourists who prefer to flock to the more commercially-successful checkpoint charlie - the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin 's most famous cold war symbol . flierl hopes to change that by injecting some authenticity into the rather bleak landscape by transporting some further real pieces of the wall to the area . " no hollywood-like rebuilding " in addition , his plan envisions using the remains of the front and secondary wall scattered around on the scruffy parks in the area between the bernauer strasse , the nordbahnhof railway station and the mauerpark and combining it with some multimedia features such as video bus tours and electronic audio guides to give visitors a real feel of the horrors of the death strip . however flierl made clear that a " a hollywood-like rebuilding of the wall as a trivialized theme park " was definitely not on the cards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men read the letters , names of victims of the berlin-wall , of wooden crosses , standing next to a re-erected strip of the former berlin wall near checkpoint charlie in berlin on oct .
31 , 2004 .
the comment was directed at the controversial rebuilding of the wall at checkpoint charlie and a memorial with wooden crosses in memory of the wall victims erected by alexandra hildebrandt , head of the checkpoint charlie museum . the berlin senate for culture has been wrangling with hildebrandt for months over the controversial exhibit .
a local court has now ordered its removal .
flierl 's latest plans include erecting an " information pavilion " on the area . historians slam plan however , flierl 's plans , in particular his refusal to reconstruct old watch towers and security barriers near the bernauer strasse , also triggered criticism on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the august 17 , 1962 photo shows dying peter fechter carried away by east german border guards who shot him down when he tried to flee to the west .
klaus-dieter henke , historian at the university of dresden said the blueprint hardly mentioned the political actors who " deprived the people of freedom through cement and guns . " manfred wilke , head of the research group on the communist regime at berlin 's free university said the plan utterly lacked shedding light on the perpetrators and the historical context . " the words ' fleeing from the gdr ' does n't make an appearance in the paper at all , " wilke said .
" but , that 's what the people associate with the wall . " question mark over finances others have more immediate concerns .
alice ströver , the education expert of the local green party warned that the undertaking could end in naught if it 's too ambitious to start with and involves too many memorials at disparate sites . most importantly , there 's no mention as yet of what the whole project would cost and where the money will come - not an unimportant matter in a broke city . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trivializing the wall as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie .

public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches . if german television is anything to go by , muslim life is still shackled by tradition and overshadowed by crime .
its image took an even steeper downward plunge after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , said fritz pleitgen , director of german public broadcaster wdr . but migrant life is n't all bad news , he insisted - and it 's high time television delivered the broader picture . melting pot germany " honor killings and arranged marriages make more of a splash in the media that differentiated depictions of normal life among migrants , " pleitgen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asli bayram was crowned miss germany 2005 he 'd rather see more coverage of upbeat news about the country 's minorities - like german-turkish director fatih akin winning the golden bear at the berlin film festival and asli bayram -lrb- photo -rrb- scooping this year 's miss germany title . after all , contemporary germany is increasing becoming a proverbial melting pot .
cultural borders have never been more blurred - one in six marriages is inter-cultural and one in four children born in germany has at least one non-german parent . remaining objective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the other hand , gang violence , honor killings and the sort of muslim fundamentalism practiced , for example , by the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who is now standing trial in istanbul after germany extradited him last year , are also a fact of modern life . but it needs to be stressed that these cases are exceptions , said marie-luise beck , a government expert on migration .
at a time when economic problems are creating wide-scale insecurity and resentment , society tends to look for scape-goats , she observed . " it 's important to report on what 's happening , " she said .
" the media has a duty to cover an inflammatory speech given by an imam .
but it 's equally important to report of the rise of right-wing extremism and show that it does n't only take the form of jackboots , it can also come packaged in a pin-stripe suit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an approach that can easily depoliticize extremism .
beck said that instead of exploring the roots of right-wing fanaticism , the media tends to promote a stereotypical image of shaven-headed nazis in bomber jackets which fails to convey the full extent of the problem - and the rise of middle-class reactionaries . beate winkler from the european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia also had reservations about the way the media portrays right-wing extremism . " right-wing extremists are turned into victims to such an extent that viewers can identify with them , " she said .
" at the same time no one really looks at their broader social role . " " why ca n't we take them as they are ? " so what can be done to encourage more objective reporting ?
while many feel that germany 's public broadcasters should assume an educational responsibility by depicting positive examples of integration , others caution against taking an over-optimistic approach . " people are always saying television should show more good news , " said ulrich deppendorf from wdr .
" but if we only ever showed positive images , we 'd lost some of our credibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to media expert rainer braun , the problem is that migrants still have n't hit the mainstream . " why is it so hard to have people from other backgrounds fronting any thing other than specifically multi-cultural shows ? " he asked .
" why could n't they read the prime-time news or host political shows - why ca n't we just take them as they are ? " cem say -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de being turkish and gay in germany germany may be considered a tolerant place for homosexuals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 germany 's media struggle with migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's missing in germany is an awareness of every-day migrant life even though some 7.3 million foreigners currently live in germany , migrant life still gets a bad rap in the media .
public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches . if german television is anything to go by , muslim life is still shackled by tradition and overshadowed by crime .
its image took an even steeper downward plunge after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , said fritz pleitgen , director of german public broadcaster wdr . but migrant life is n't all bad news , he insisted - and it 's high time television delivered the broader picture . melting pot germany " honor killings and arranged marriages make more of a splash in the media that differentiated depictions of normal life among migrants , " pleitgen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asli bayram was crowned miss germany 2005 he 'd rather see more coverage of upbeat news about the country 's minorities - like german-turkish director fatih akin winning the golden bear at the berlin film festival and asli bayram -lrb- photo -rrb- scooping this year 's miss germany title . after all , contemporary germany is increasing becoming a proverbial melting pot .
cultural borders have never been more blurred - one in six marriages is inter-cultural and one in four children born in germany has at least one non-german parent . remaining objective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the other hand , gang violence , honor killings and the sort of muslim fundamentalism practiced , for example , by the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who is now standing trial in istanbul after germany extradited him last year , are also a fact of modern life . but it needs to be stressed that these cases are exceptions , said marie-luise beck , a government expert on migration .
at a time when economic problems are creating wide-scale insecurity and resentment , society tends to look for scape-goats , she observed . " it 's important to report on what 's happening , " she said .
" the media has a duty to cover an inflammatory speech given by an imam .
but it 's equally important to report of the rise of right-wing extremism and show that it does n't only take the form of jackboots , it can also come packaged in a pin-stripe suit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an approach that can easily depoliticize extremism .
beck said that instead of exploring the roots of right-wing fanaticism , the media tends to promote a stereotypical image of shaven-headed nazis in bomber jackets which fails to convey the full extent of the problem - and the rise of middle-class reactionaries . beate winkler from the european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia also had reservations about the way the media portrays right-wing extremism . " right-wing extremists are turned into victims to such an extent that viewers can identify with them , " she said .
" at the same time no one really looks at their broader social role . " " why ca n't we take them as they are ? " so what can be done to encourage more objective reporting ?
while many feel that germany 's public broadcasters should assume an educational responsibility by depicting positive examples of integration , others caution against taking an over-optimistic approach . " people are always saying television should show more good news , " said ulrich deppendorf from wdr .
" but if we only ever showed positive images , we 'd lost some of our credibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to media expert rainer braun , the problem is that migrants still have n't hit the mainstream . " why is it so hard to have people from other backgrounds fronting any thing other than specifically multi-cultural shows ? " he asked .
" why could n't they read the prime-time news or host political shows - why ca n't we just take them as they are ? " cem say -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de being turkish and gay in germany germany may be considered a tolerant place for homosexuals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 german politicians push innovation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young scientists should n't hide their light under a bushel the need to promote innovation , research and development has become a key issue in german politics , with both government and opposition outlining plans to improve what has apparently become a weak point in the economy . on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder called on german businesses to be more courageous when turning inventions into marketable products . the fax machine , the mobile phone and modern flat-panel screens have become symbols of german research ingenuity - but also of the country 's inability to turn them into money-making products .
their basic technology is said to have been invented in germany , but it was companies elsewhere in the world that profited the most from selling them . focusing on opportunities in a bid to jumpstart german competitiveness , the german chancellor called on business and political leaders to show more courage when reaching out for tomorrow 's opportunities . " nobody says we should ignore risks , " he said .
" but it would be equally misplaced to become engrossed in constant analysis of what could go wrong and how could we minimize the effects .
we need a culture that focuses first and foremost on the opportunities , without , of course , letting the risks totally slip from view . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking at the opening of a nationwide campaign to promote up and coming young scientists , the chancellor highlighted a new government package of measures worth 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- , that was aimed at supporting universities and elite research centers in their bid to create innovative technologies and products . he also promised 140 million euros in state support for innovative start-up businesses , and demanded more funding from germany ’ s federal states for improvements in general education . opposition concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservative opposition on monday also devoted a symposium to innovation in germany .
cdu leader angela merkel criticized the schröder government for what she called its heavy-handed interference in the freedom of science and research . " we must make sure that research projects are only evaluated by researchers , " merkel said .
" if politics becomes involved in science , innovation is bound to suffer .
politicians tend to support only those projects which have already garnered much publicity and some public prominence . " merkel 's criticism concerns a research project into gene-spliced plants for which funding was stopped recently by the government .
merkel also accused germany 's green party of ideological bias with regard genetic engineering .
a recent genetic engineering law passed by the red-green government coalition , she said , was clearly meant to prevent innovation in agriculture rather than foster this technology . heinrich oberreuther , a political scientist , said party strategies towards an innovative economy could become a vote winner in germany . " a party that neglects this issue will cause major problems for germany as a whole , " he said .
" promoting innovation has become a matter of do or die for all political organizations . " low self-esteem and indeed , only about 11 percent of all germans believe that this country is still spearheading the drive for innovative products in the world . german pollster forsa published a survey on monday saying that 62 percent of people here think germany is now mediocre in the field of engineering and 25 percent believe standards have fallen below mediocre . but the forsa findings are thrown into a different light by a recent emnid report on " the image of germany abroad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in sharp contrast to germany 's image of itself , the " made in germany " brand was given a high rating by the us , spain , england , france , sweden and poland . german companies do indeed enjoy greater profit growth than their us counterparts , and the country is an international market leader when it comes to innovative fields such as bio- and nanotechnology . if it wants to make lasting progress , germany will first have to overcome its inferiority complex . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reinventing german innovation a recent study into the " to be or not to be " of self-employment revealed a national reluctance among germans to go it alone .
but inventors are crying out for a chance to give the country a cutting-edge status . -lrb- feb .
1 , 2005 -rrb- german innovation stalled at home internet calling , the biggest innovation in communications since the invention of the telephone , was " made in germany . "
but while the international market is booming , regulation has stalled its domestic advance .

13 . , 2002 , the 41st anniversary of the building of the berlin wall .
flierl 's plan foresees building upon the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , the scene of several escape attempts during the cold war .
at present , about 70 meters of the former border strip have been bracketed off into two seven-meter high steel walls .
visitors can peer through slits in the hinterland wall into the empty death strip . however , the bernauer strasse memorial remains largely ignored by the hordes of daily tourists who prefer to flock to the more commercially-successful checkpoint charlie - the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin 's most famous cold war symbol . flierl hopes to change that by injecting some authenticity into the rather bleak landscape by transporting some further real pieces of the wall to the area . " no hollywood-like rebuilding " in addition , his plan envisions using the remains of the front and secondary wall scattered around on the scruffy parks in the area between the bernauer strasse , the nordbahnhof railway station and the mauerpark and combining it with some multimedia features such as video bus tours and electronic audio guides to give visitors a real feel of the horrors of the death strip . however flierl made clear that a " a hollywood-like rebuilding of the wall as a trivialized theme park " was definitely not on the cards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men read the letters , names of victims of the berlin-wall , of wooden crosses , standing next to a re-erected strip of the former berlin wall near checkpoint charlie in berlin on oct .
31 , 2004 .
the comment was directed at the controversial rebuilding of the wall at checkpoint charlie and a memorial with wooden crosses in memory of the wall victims erected by alexandra hildebrandt , head of the checkpoint charlie museum . the berlin senate for culture has been wrangling with hildebrandt for months over the controversial exhibit .
a local court has now ordered its removal .
flierl 's latest plans include erecting an " information pavilion " on the area . historians slam plan however , flierl 's plans , in particular his refusal to reconstruct old watch towers and security barriers near the bernauer strasse , also triggered criticism on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the august 17 , 1962 photo shows dying peter fechter carried away by east german border guards who shot him down when he tried to flee to the west .
klaus-dieter henke , historian at the university of dresden said the blueprint hardly mentioned the political actors who " deprived the people of freedom through cement and guns . " manfred wilke , head of the research group on the communist regime at berlin 's free university said the plan utterly lacked shedding light on the perpetrators and the historical context . " the words ' fleeing from the gdr ' does n't make an appearance in the paper at all , " wilke said .
" but , that 's what the people associate with the wall . " question mark over finances others have more immediate concerns .
alice ströver , the education expert of the local green party warned that the undertaking could end in naught if it 's too ambitious to start with and involves too many memorials at disparate sites . most importantly , there 's no mention as yet of what the whole project would cost and where the money will come - not an unimportant matter in a broke city . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trivializing the wall as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie .

" i do n't think that people in the us and the anglo-saxon countries would be unsatisfied with a french rejection , " juncker , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said in an interview on french radio . " that would in fact correspond with their idea of europe as one that 's weakened , because it would mean giving up the most noble of its ambitions for the future , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker is worried about the french referendum .
juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- added that the us and other anglo-saxon countries had no sympathy for " the idea of a constitution , for this strengthening of europe , " and they did n't want europe as " a completely responsible and competent player " on the world stage . juncker 's comments come at a time of growing concern in france and elsewhere in on the continent that a french " non " to the treaty would effectively throw the entire european integration process into disarray . drawn up by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , the constitution is meant to simplify decision-making in the european union but it must first be adopted by all 25 member states . six weeks before the planned french referendum on may 29 , opinion polls show 55 percent support for ' no ' with 45 percent backing the document . vote sparks infighting in government inside france , rejecting the constitution would gravely undermine the standing of president jacques chirac 's government .
but it would also set off a bitter internal war among the socialists , whose leadership is campaigning in favor of the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac during his television appearance in an attempt to lobby support for the eu constitution hopes that chirac could revitalize the fortunes of the ' yes ' camp in a two-hour appearance before a group of 80 young people have come to nothing .
chirac said during the television debate on thursday that he will not personally resign if the constitution is rejected by the electorate , but the dismissal of a prime minister is the standard way for a french president to extricate himself from political difficulties . on tuesday there were clear signals that prime minister jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- will lose his job if opponents of the text win the referendum .
tensions over the continuing failure of the government 's " yes " campaign spilled over at a weekly ministerial breakfast meeting with what officials described as a " very violent argument " between raffarin and interior minister dominique de villepin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin raffarin -lrb- photo -rrb- was reportedly furious about remarks made by villepin in a radio interview sunday that were openly critical of the way the government has handled the run-up to the may 29 vote and hinted at the prime minister 's approaching replacement . concerns in germany meanwhile , politicians in germany seemed alarmed at the consequences for europe of a french rejection . german interior minister otto schily warned that a french ' no ' would also be a serious setback for european home affairs and justice policies .
" i really hope that the french people can be successfully convinced that they would be making a serious mistake if this referendum fails , " schily said tuesday in berlin . germany will not hold a referendum on the constitution but will put it to a vote before parliament .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , is set to ratify the treaty on may 12 - ahead of the french referendum - to give its neighbor a boost .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is expected to rubber-stamp it a few weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer , however , put a brave face on the french crisis on monday . " i firmly believe that france , despite the current opinion polls , will vote ' yes ' , " he told handelsblatt business daily .
fischer said that france 's approval of the first eu constitution was crucial as " the founding nation of the european union . " the green party politician said the only alternative to allowing the treaty to come into force would be to revert to the 2000 treaty of nice , which eu leaders have described as a recipe for deadlock in an expanding bloc . " it is an illusion to think one could reopen the constitutional package and renegotiate it .
there will not be a better eu constitution in the foreseeable future , " fischer said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french ' yes ' referendum camp fights back french president jacques chirac is leading an offensive to convince reluctant french voters of the merits of the eu constitution .

their basic technology is said to have been invented in germany , but it was companies elsewhere in the world that profited the most from selling them . focusing on opportunities in a bid to jumpstart german competitiveness , the german chancellor called on business and political leaders to show more courage when reaching out for tomorrow 's opportunities . " nobody says we should ignore risks , " he said .
" but it would be equally misplaced to become engrossed in constant analysis of what could go wrong and how could we minimize the effects .
we need a culture that focuses first and foremost on the opportunities , without , of course , letting the risks totally slip from view . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking at the opening of a nationwide campaign to promote up and coming young scientists , the chancellor highlighted a new government package of measures worth 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.47 billion -rrb- , that was aimed at supporting universities and elite research centers in their bid to create innovative technologies and products . he also promised 140 million euros in state support for innovative start-up businesses , and demanded more funding from germany ’ s federal states for improvements in general education . opposition concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservative opposition on monday also devoted a symposium to innovation in germany .
cdu leader angela merkel criticized the schröder government for what she called its heavy-handed interference in the freedom of science and research . " we must make sure that research projects are only evaluated by researchers , " merkel said .
" if politics becomes involved in science , innovation is bound to suffer .
politicians tend to support only those projects which have already garnered much publicity and some public prominence . " merkel 's criticism concerns a research project into gene-spliced plants for which funding was stopped recently by the government .
merkel also accused germany 's green party of ideological bias with regard genetic engineering .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.04.2005 germany 's joseph ratzinger elected pope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservative cardinal was close to pope john paul ii after initial uncertainty , white smoke rose from the chimney of the sistine chapel indicating the election of a new pope .
bavarian cardinal joseph ratzinger became the 265th pope . germany 's joseph ratzinger was elected pope for the world 's one billion catholics on tuesday evening .
he chose the name benedict xvi .
the new pontiff briefly addressed the hundreds of thousands of catholics gathered at st. peter 's square from a balcony on st. peter 's basilica .
" dear brothers and sisters , after the great pope john paul ii the cardinals have elected me a simple and humble laborer in the vineyard of the lord , " he said , paying tribute to his predecessor .
the throngs of catholics filling the square had greeted with cheers smoke - which first appeared black , but then turned white - spewed from the chimney of the sistine chapel around 6 p.m.
-lrb- 1600 utc -rrb- to signal the cardinals had reached a two-thirds majority .
after a few minutes , the bells of st. peter 's basilica began pealing , confirming the election of a new pope .
soon after , ratzinger appeared on the balcony to the gleeful cheers of the thousands that had gathered .
in germany , a crowd began to gather in the pouring rain in regensburg , where the new pope was a longtime university professor .
bildunterschrift : priests celebrated as white smoke billowed from the chimney of the sistine chapel at the vatican , on tuesday ratzinger is considered one of the catholic church 's most powerful and most orthodox clergymen .
but it was n't always that way .
as a young man in bavaria , caught up in the reform-fervor that accompanied the 1960s student revolts , ratzinger was known as someone to support reforms in the church .
but that changed when pope john paul ii was elected in 1978 , ratzinger - made a cardinal in 1977 - quickly developed into his right-hand man .
the two shared similar conservative views against women in the church , abortion and pregnancy counseling centers .

" there has n't been a coherent wall concept so far , just remains of the wall scattered over the city - a double row of cobblestones in some places to mark the former border and a few disparate signs and plaques on the wall victims , ” dominique krüssen of the berlin senate for culture told dw-world last year .
" it probably was a mistake to tear it down to such a large extent in the early 1990s . " expanding official memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin visitors look through the wall at bernauer strasse on aug .
13 . , 2002 , the 41st anniversary of the building of the berlin wall .
flierl 's plan foresees building upon the official berlin wall memorial at the bernauer strasse , the scene of several escape attempts during the cold war .
at present , about 70 meters of the former border strip have been bracketed off into two seven-meter high steel walls .
visitors can peer through slits in the hinterland wall into the empty death strip . however , the bernauer strasse memorial remains largely ignored by the hordes of daily tourists who prefer to flock to the more commercially-successful checkpoint charlie - the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin 's most famous cold war symbol . flierl hopes to change that by injecting some authenticity into the rather bleak landscape by transporting some further real pieces of the wall to the area . " no hollywood-like rebuilding " in addition , his plan envisions using the remains of the front and secondary wall scattered around on the scruffy parks in the area between the bernauer strasse , the nordbahnhof railway station and the mauerpark and combining it with some multimedia features such as video bus tours and electronic audio guides to give visitors a real feel of the horrors of the death strip . however flierl made clear that a " a hollywood-like rebuilding of the wall as a trivialized theme park " was definitely not on the cards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men read the letters , names of victims of the berlin-wall , of wooden crosses , standing next to a re-erected strip of the former berlin wall near checkpoint charlie in berlin on oct .
31 , 2004 .
the comment was directed at the controversial rebuilding of the wall at checkpoint charlie and a memorial with wooden crosses in memory of the wall victims erected by alexandra hildebrandt , head of the checkpoint charlie museum . the berlin senate for culture has been wrangling with hildebrandt for months over the controversial exhibit .
a local court has now ordered its removal .
flierl 's latest plans include erecting an " information pavilion " on the area . historians slam plan however , flierl 's plans , in particular his refusal to reconstruct old watch towers and security barriers near the bernauer strasse , also triggered criticism on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the august 17 , 1962 photo shows dying peter fechter carried away by east german border guards who shot him down when he tried to flee to the west .
klaus-dieter henke , historian at the university of dresden said the blueprint hardly mentioned the political actors who " deprived the people of freedom through cement and guns . " manfred wilke , head of the research group on the communist regime at berlin 's free university said the plan utterly lacked shedding light on the perpetrators and the historical context . " the words ' fleeing from the gdr ' does n't make an appearance in the paper at all , " wilke said .
" but , that 's what the people associate with the wall . " question mark over finances others have more immediate concerns .
alice ströver , the education expert of the local green party warned that the undertaking could end in naught if it 's too ambitious to start with and involves too many memorials at disparate sites . most importantly , there 's no mention as yet of what the whole project would cost and where the money will come - not an unimportant matter in a broke city . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trivializing the wall as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie .

bavarian cardinal joseph ratzinger became the 265th pope . germany 's joseph ratzinger was elected pope for the world 's one billion catholics on tuesday evening .
he chose the name benedict xvi .
the new pontiff briefly addressed the hundreds of thousands of catholics gathered at st. peter 's square from a balcony on st. peter 's basilica .
" dear brothers and sisters , after the great pope john paul ii the cardinals have elected me a simple and humble laborer in the vineyard of the lord , " he said , paying tribute to his predecessor .
the throngs of catholics filling the square had greeted with cheers smoke - which first appeared black , but then turned white - spewed from the chimney of the sistine chapel around 6 p.m.
-lrb- 1600 utc -rrb- to signal the cardinals had reached a two-thirds majority .
after a few minutes , the bells of st. peter 's basilica began pealing , confirming the election of a new pope .
soon after , ratzinger appeared on the balcony to the gleeful cheers of the thousands that had gathered .
in germany , a crowd began to gather in the pouring rain in regensburg , where the new pope was a longtime university professor .
bildunterschrift : priests celebrated as white smoke billowed from the chimney of the sistine chapel at the vatican , on tuesday ratzinger is considered one of the catholic church 's most powerful and most orthodox clergymen .
but it was n't always that way .
as a young man in bavaria , caught up in the reform-fervor that accompanied the 1960s student revolts , ratzinger was known as someone to support reforms in the church .
but that changed when pope john paul ii was elected in 1978 , ratzinger - made a cardinal in 1977 - quickly developed into his right-hand man .
the two shared similar conservative views against women in the church , abortion and pregnancy counseling centers .
he once called abortion a " culture of death . "
ratzinger also squabbled with three german cardinals in 1994 about divorcees being allowed to marry again in the church .

"
what would happen if india 's formidable army of call center operators dropped their professional tone and got personal on the phone ?
a german artist group is looking for the answer with their project , " call cutta . " " have you ever lied on the phone or used a false name ? " - the unexpected question asked huskily in an indian accent over my headphones stops me in my tracks .
i 'm on a walking tour called " call cutta , " through an unfamiliar and desolate stretch of berlin 's usually vibrant kreuzberg neighborhood .
after renting a hands-free mobile set from the local hebbel theater and waiting for a call , i 'm now following instructions provided via the phone by a flirtatious guide calling himself ' bruce . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin .
for the past hour , he 's navigated me through buildings , parks , playgrounds , cellars and courtyards , fed me intriguing scraps of information on the history of the area and teased out some rather personal details . but , as i consider his latest question , i suspect bruce does it all the time .
after all , he 's never set eyes on the landscape he 's been meticulously steering me through .
what 's more , ' bruce ' is n't even his real name .
in reality , he 's kanav chopra , a 20-year-old indian student sitting in a swanky call center called " infinity towers " 15,000 kilometers away in calcutta . cultural outsourcing trying to explore what would happen if a call center routine was turned on its head and taken beyond commercial limits to a personal and intimate level was exactly what german / swiss artist trio rimini protokoll had in mind when they conceived of " call cutta " - in their words an intercontinental mobile phone theater - during a visit to the west bengal capital last year .
the artists were inspired by salt lake city , a booming district of glass buildings housing call centers on the outskirts of the city .
" it was a total contrast to everything else in calcutta , " said daniel wetzel , one of the artists in the group .
" it was also surreal .
suddenly the west with its money and capitalism was here and the people sitting in these buildings were pretending to be a part of it - it provided the perfect stage setting . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " call cutta " performers in calcutta much like siemens and other german companies who have rushed to india to take advantage of low labor costs , the artists ' outsourced ' the " call cutta " project : they hired ten people in calcutta , some of them fluent in german , set them up in a glitzy call center and trained them in a basic script detailing routes and landmarks in a neighborhood in calcutta and in berlin .
naturally indian the rest of the performance was pretty much left up to them .
" there are clear limits in a call center .
we wanted to get away from that and allow the operators to improvise and bring in their own voices , " said wetzel .
" theater is all about the senses .
in this case the feeling that you 're talking to a real person is important even though it 's from a great distance . "
thus , unlike the operators in india 's booming call centers who dub themselves " john " and " sara " and adopt british and american accents to disguise their origin and put their customers in the west at ease , the calcutta call center performers sound unabashedly indian and human as they guide , flirt , play-act and even sing their way around on the tour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a participant on the " call cutta " tour in berlin david xavier -lrb- his real name -rrb- , who steers people through the northern calcutta neighborhood of hatibagan in the afternoon and through kreuzberg in the evening , said it 's all a matter of being imaginative .
" the reaction from walkers , whether in berlin or calcutta , is overwhelmingly positive , " the 39-year-old said .
" they 're surprised at the different perspectives the tour can open up about their own cities . "
more than a telephone connection there 's another twist to the surprise and weirdness of the tour - the artists have woven in the history of colonial india 's struggle for independence from the british into the kreuzberg district where the " call cutta " tour is set .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose thus , obediently following bruce 's instructions and feeling like i 'm on a treasure hunt , i get down on my hands and knees next to a dustbin in a park and peer underneath it to find a faded picture of subhas chandra bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a famous freedom fighter from bengal .
bose spent time between 1941 and 1943 in berlin trying to recruit hitler 's help in fighting the british .
apparently his office and the radio station " free india " he set up were once in this area . further along , to the amusement of a gaggle of neighborhood children trailing me by now , i 'm led to another hidden photograph of a striking young indian soldier , one of the many thousands who belonged to bose 's " free india " army and which was incorporated into hitler 's until the end of the second world war .
connecting across the miles slightly overwhelmed by the intensity and busyness of the encounter but looking at my surroundings with new eyes , i come to the end of the tour in a shiny mall at potsdamer platz to finally see ' bruce ' waving at me from a small screen in the window of a consumer electronics store .
according to the artists , the prime goal of the project , despite occasional hitches like the phone connection being lost , is communication .
" people here might know a lot about india and the call center boom , " said wetzel .
" but all that knowledge does n't help in countering unfair clichés if you 've never really spoken to or had a real exchange with an indian . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the artists need n't worry about that .
mark stuver , 30 , from san francisco , who was in berlin for the first time and did the tour with ' dawn , ' admitted he 'd exchanged phone numbers with her . " it was a bit crazy being guided in berlin all the way from india , " said stuver .
" but , though we were thousands of miles apart , we still connected . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.04.2005 germany 's media struggle with migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's missing in germany is an awareness of every-day migrant life even though some 7.3 million foreigners currently live in germany , migrant life still gets a bad rap in the media .
public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches . if german television is anything to go by , muslim life is still shackled by tradition and overshadowed by crime .
its image took an even steeper downward plunge after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , said fritz pleitgen , director of german public broadcaster wdr . but migrant life is n't all bad news , he insisted - and it 's high time television delivered the broader picture . melting pot germany " honor killings and arranged marriages make more of a splash in the media that differentiated depictions of normal life among migrants , " pleitgen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asli bayram was crowned miss germany 2005 he 'd rather see more coverage of upbeat news about the country 's minorities - like german-turkish director fatih akin winning the golden bear at the berlin film festival and asli bayram -lrb- photo -rrb- scooping this year 's miss germany title . after all , contemporary germany is increasing becoming a proverbial melting pot .
cultural borders have never been more blurred - one in six marriages is inter-cultural and one in four children born in germany has at least one non-german parent . remaining objective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the other hand , gang violence , honor killings and the sort of muslim fundamentalism practiced , for example , by the so-called caliph of cologne , metin kaplan , who is now standing trial in istanbul after germany extradited him last year , are also a fact of modern life . but it needs to be stressed that these cases are exceptions , said marie-luise beck , a government expert on migration .
at a time when economic problems are creating wide-scale insecurity and resentment , society tends to look for scape-goats , she observed . " it 's important to report on what 's happening , " she said .
" the media has a duty to cover an inflammatory speech given by an imam .
but it 's equally important to report of the rise of right-wing extremism and show that it does n't only take the form of jackboots , it can also come packaged in a pin-stripe suit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an approach that can easily depoliticize extremism .
beck said that instead of exploring the roots of right-wing fanaticism , the media tends to promote a stereotypical image of shaven-headed nazis in bomber jackets which fails to convey the full extent of the problem - and the rise of middle-class reactionaries . beate winkler from the european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia also had reservations about the way the media portrays right-wing extremism . " right-wing extremists are turned into victims to such an extent that viewers can identify with them , " she said .
" at the same time no one really looks at their broader social role . " " why ca n't we take them as they are ? " so what can be done to encourage more objective reporting ?
while many feel that germany 's public broadcasters should assume an educational responsibility by depicting positive examples of integration , others caution against taking an over-optimistic approach . " people are always saying television should show more good news , " said ulrich deppendorf from wdr .
" but if we only ever showed positive images , we 'd lost some of our credibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to media expert rainer braun , the problem is that migrants still have n't hit the mainstream . " why is it so hard to have people from other backgrounds fronting any thing other than specifically multi-cultural shows ? " he asked .

visitors can peer through slits in the hinterland wall into the empty death strip . however , the bernauer strasse memorial remains largely ignored by the hordes of daily tourists who prefer to flock to the more commercially-successful checkpoint charlie - the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and berlin 's most famous cold war symbol . flierl hopes to change that by injecting some authenticity into the rather bleak landscape by transporting some further real pieces of the wall to the area . " no hollywood-like rebuilding " in addition , his plan envisions using the remains of the front and secondary wall scattered around on the scruffy parks in the area between the bernauer strasse , the nordbahnhof railway station and the mauerpark and combining it with some multimedia features such as video bus tours and electronic audio guides to give visitors a real feel of the horrors of the death strip . however flierl made clear that a " a hollywood-like rebuilding of the wall as a trivialized theme park " was definitely not on the cards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men read the letters , names of victims of the berlin-wall , of wooden crosses , standing next to a re-erected strip of the former berlin wall near checkpoint charlie in berlin on oct .

the union said patrol staff had been sent a letter saying most were very committed to the aa and its members , but a few workers were falling short .
staff who meet expectations will get £ 2,000 in recognition of their work , but those below standard will be offered £ 18,000 voluntary severance .
the aa denied the gmb 's claims , saying a maximum of 20 jobs would go .
the aa was bought by venture capital firms cvc partners and permira from centrica for £ 1.75bn -lrb- $ 3.13bn -rrb- in july 2004 .
gmb official paul maloney said : " the venture capitalists currently running the aa are seeking to force 431 patrol staff out of a job and they are trying to do it in the most underhand way .
" they are trying to bribe employees with money and are asking them to sign confidentiality agreements in return for giving up their jobs . "
' minority fall short ' the gmb says it represents about half the patrol staff at the aa , with the other half members of an in-house union .
the aa said it had been reviewing the performance of patrols , as part of an " ongoing business transformation " .
" the review , carried out with full union consultation , has identified that whilst the majority of patrols meet or exceed the company 's expectations , a minority fall short of achieving the required performance levels , " it said in a statement .
" there are also a very small number of individuals who are potentially redundant due to low workload in their geographical area . "
an improved package of measures was available for patrols performing well and a comprehensive package was in place for those leaving the company , the aa added .

we heard the story of one teenager , daisy , who witnessed terrible arguments between her father and her mother .
and , we talked to the chief executive of women 's aid , nicola harwin .
" the domestic violence began when i was 10 , " daisy told us .
" i would hear lots of screaming and shouting - and my elder sisters trying to stop it .
" every night i was waking up to the sound on shouting - i 'm not sure my parents knew i was aware of what was going on . "
nicola was one of six children - but she could n't bring herself to confide in her sisters , or in any one else .

general motors , the world 's biggest auto firm , said on tuesday that it expects a fierce price war with its rivals to intensify .
results from the firm , expected later on tuesday , are expected to show growth flagging elsewhere in the world .
gm says it will invest $ 3bn to double chinese production by 2007 , while ford has announced a new engine plant .
ford 's new venture in the eastern city of nanjing is a joint operation with chinese firm changan and japan 's mazda .
it will supply a neighbouring manufacturing plant , the construction of which started in january .
reliance on loans for all main carmakers , china - now the third biggest car market after the us and japan - is seen as a key prize in a world of stagnating sales and falling profits .
big us car firms are now relying on finance - both loans to buy cars and general financial products - to stay in the black and offset losses from vehicle sales .
the hunger for automobiles shown by the several hundred million inhabitants of china 's cities have been seen as a lifeline .
but sales growth is tapering off there too , the latest figures show .
gm said it saw sales in the three months to june rise 8.3 % to 132,401 vehicles , giving it a 10.4 % market share .
volkswagen remains the leading foreign seller , with several chinese marques well ahead of that .
overall , however , vehicle sales in the first quarter were down 1.16 % on the same period the year before at 1.27 million - with car sales in particular dropping more than 3 % .
in 2004 , car sales rose 15 % after doubling the previous year .
however , since then the government has responded to soaring energy costs , an overheating economy which is growing at more than 9 % a year , and worries about a rise in bad debts by tightening the rules on credit .

central trains says it caught more than 80 people for fare evasion in the first month of a crackdown , netting the company almost £ 14,000 in fines .
people who have been caught without a ticket will see their names published on posters at stations .
central trains says the posters will also say where the fare dodgers are from and the fines they were charged .
' posters a deterrent ' a company spokeswoman said they were the first rail operator in the country to name and shame people convicted of fare evasion .
" in just four weeks , we have prosecuted 88 people for not having a train ticket and in a few months there will be many more names joining them " , business manager richard brooks said .
" our fare paying passengers told us they do n't think it is fair that some people do n't pay for a ticket , so we are doing all we can to try and prevent this from happening .

five years later , the rhino population had dropped by nearly a quarter , authorities said .

vanunu can not now leave israel until at least 19 april 2006 , said ministry spokesman gilad heiman .
vanunu served 18 years in jail , most of it in solitary confinement , for making public details of israel 's secret nuclear programme .
he was released in april 2004 under strict conditions .
vanunu has not been allowed to have a passport , is forbidden to approach ports and airports , and is banned from talking to foreigners without permission .
israel insists vanunu still poses a security threat .
the israeli authorities charged vanunu in march with violating the terms of his release from jail by giving interviews to the foreign media .
vanunu says his action in revealing israel 's nuclear secrets aimed to avert a nuclear holocaust in the region .
many israelis view him as a traitor .

the comedy drama about life on a rough manchester council estate has been steadily growing in popularity and has won a plethora of prizes .
an audience of more than two million viewers tune in regularly to watch the exploits of the gallagher family and their stories of scams , sex , drugs , violence and love .
sharp dialogue , an intelligent script and well-formed characters has made the series one of the brightest new dramas on the box .
it is a position confirmed by the show 's recent success at the baftas and royal television society awards .
the quality of the writing takes shameless to another level of television drama boyd hilton , heat magazine boyd hilton , tv editor at heat magazine , said there was little to rival shameless ' supremacy .
" i think the acting is brilliant , right down to the kids , and the pace is very fast-moving - i do n't think any scene lasts longer than two minutes .
" i ca n't think of any contemporary drama that comes near to it in terms of quality .
" only coronation street comes close in terms of saying something about modern life in britain today . "
the gallaghers ' life is told through the working-class eyes of those living on the fictional chatsworth estate .
christmas complaints head of the gallagher family is frank , who embarks on a series of adventures with his children fiona , debbie , carl , liam , lip and ian as the family goes about their chaotic everyday business .
filming on the third series is already underway , despite the show attracting controversy along the way .
scores of complaints were lodged against a promotional advert for the christmas edition of the show last year .
closely resembling leonardo da vinci 's the last supper , it featured 12 members of the dysfunctional gallagher family seated around the dinner table for a drunken christmas meal .
in the centre was frank wearing a tinsel crown with lager can and cigarette in hand .
writing skills but the criticism failed to dampen shameless ' pull - thanks in no small part to writer paul abbott .
the critically-acclaimed writer is also behind hits like state of play , cracker and clocking off .
he walked off with a hat-trick of awards from the royal television society - including best writer and the judges ' award for outstanding contribution to tv , as well as best drama series .
hilton believes it is abbott 's sharp writing skills that has put shameless at the top of the tv pile .
" the quality of the writing takes shameless to another level of television drama and makes it almost soap opera-like .
" i think its paul abbott 's most personal work .
" it is heightened realism of course , but i think it is the closest thing he has done to his working-class , northern background and closest to his heart .

a total of 301 were tested to see if they could be donors for anna culshaw from carrog in denbighshire .
anna culshaw has regular blood transfusions but needs a bone marrow transplant to survive .
a clinic to test if people were suitable donors was held at ysgol caer drewyn in corwen on monday .
her family is now hoping a match can be found from among the people who gave blood samples to be tested .
anna 's father eddie culshaw , from carrog , said he had been told there was a good chance of finding a donor in the local area , and had urged people to join the bone marrow register .
we have gone round a lot of businesses , the schools have been fantastic , and we have had a good response to our hotline karen archer , anthony nolan trust mr culshaw said he hoped the clinics would help raise awareness of the need for bone marrow donors , and help other patients like anna .
" it is not just for anna - there are other children and adults out there looking for bone marrow , " he said .
" the only thing they can do is search the register . "
speaking at the event , he added : " ther turnout has been fantastic .
there are so many people here , and people we do n't know - we will never be able to thank them all .
" they are coming from as far afield as mid wales . "
anna 's condition - myelodisplasia - stops her bone marrow making sufficient numbers of red blood cells .
eddie culshaw at the bone marrow clinic held in school a donor 's bone marrow , which is " harvested " during an hour-long procedure carried out under general anaesthetic , would replace anna 's .
the marrow is extracted from a donor 's pelvic bone using a needle and syringe .
the person normally stays in hospital for a night or two and may feel tiredness or discomfort in the lower back afterwards .
karen archer , donor recruitment manager for the anthony nolan trust , said : " it 's so fantastic to be able to come to a community like this who have responded to a little girl in the area , but knowing they could help anyone in the world . "
a second session is being held on tuesday at the bakery where anna 's mother works .
' lovely girl ' jayne davies , the acting head at ysgol caer drewyn , said the school had been more than willing to set up the clinic .
" the staff and parents are keen to do anything they can to help anna , " she said .
" she is a lovely girl , with lots of friends in the school " lots of the children send her cards and gifts .
she is always in their thoughts . "
anna 's father said she was looking forward to being back at her school to see the clinic taking place .
" in a funny sort of way , she 's really excited , because she 'll be back in school , as she has n't been there for a few weeks , " he said .
last month , three players from anna 's favourite football team everton - kevin kilbane , david weir and leon osman - visited her home to wish her well .

in 1985 , she and her husband were arrested simply for holding opinions unpopular with the regime of king hassan ii .
some 22,000 people have filed claims in prison , maria listened to her husband 's screams as he was tortured .
until one day , they stopped .
" some days i did n't see him and i did n't hear him , " she says .
" the police told me he was in hospital , but three days after that , when i came back home , we had a telegram saying that he was dead . "
she starts sobbing as she recalls : " the police ... kept the body .
so i never saw him dead . "
maria had to accept her husband 's death in silence , afraid that if she made accusations against the police , she might meet the same fate .
now , for the first time , maria and thousands of other moroccans are being allowed to speak openly about the state-sponsored terror under the regime of the late king hassan ii .
morocco is the first country in the arab world to have set up a truth and reconciliation commission .
compensation used most notably in south africa , reconciliation commissions usually aim to break with human rights abuses of the past by confronting those responsible .
morocco 's equity and reconciliation commission is due to present its findings this month .
we have cases of people who have been tortured , kidnapped and some of them killed for their political views , even last year mohamed el-boukili moroccan association for human rights abderazak tebarak , one of the commission staff whose job it is to document these cases , indicates rows and rows of files : about 22,000 applications by individuals who say they were tortured or that their family members disappeared .
all of them deal with a period of time starting with the independence of morocco in 1956 , and ending in 1999 - coinciding exactly with the reign of the late king hassan ii .
as abderazak tebarak explains , there was a reason for1999 cut-off date : " the commission works on the terrorists of the past , so it has to have a clear idea and to make a distance from the present . "
the commission uses the files to assess how much compensation victims and their families should be given .
for maria sharaf , the $ 15,000 dollars she received was not enough .
" when i have seen my son groaning without his father , how much can they give me to make me forget that ? " she says .
" i want to live a normal life but i ca n't . "
failing there are other criticisms levelled at the equity and reconciliation commission , or the ier as it is known here .
an independent organisation , the moroccan association for human rights , is investigating current human rights abuses in morocco .
morocco 's secret police remains a feared force the association 's mohamed el boukili , says the ier is failing because , unlike other reconciliation commissions , not one of the 22,000 files at the ier headquarters will result in a prosecution .
" we have cases of people who have been tortured , kidnapped and some of them killed for their political views , even last year , " mohamed el boukili says .
" we stick to naming torturers because we aim to prosecute them , so this ca n't be repeated in the future . "
mr boukili 's association has published a list of alleged torturers it thinks should face prosecution .
they include figures in morocco 's current administration .
but abdelhay moudden of the ier says the commission does not need to prosecute individuals to change the system and break with the past .
" our major task is how to reform this political system from within and if our answers and our recommendations are not addressing these violations then the ier is useless , " he says .
dark era the testimonies of torture victims are televised live by the ier , and make emotional viewing even for moroccans too young to remember the so-called " years of lead " .
" i think it 's a good idea , " one woman told the bbc .
" it gives people more of a chance to know about something that was silenced and was not known . "
but one woman is not convinced that times have changed .
" if i say i do n't agree with the king , i will have problems .
i ca n't say it here in front of people or in the street , " she says .

mark mcgowan , 37 , said he had taken pictures of himself scratching vehicles ' paintwork as part of a project .
but the london performance artist has since admitted the cars were already " keyed " and the photos were " staged " .
he said it had been an art project that had gone " horribly wrong " and said he was " very , very sorry " .
" i never keyed any cars ... the whole thing has just been a nightmare , " he added . "
at least i 've shown people do care about car crime " mark mcgowan " all i wanted to do was highlight the plight of people who have had their cars scratched , which has somehow spiralled out of control .
" my family and friends have shunned me and someone rang into a radio show and said they wanted to rip my head off .
" but at least i 've shown people do care about car crime . "
mr mcgowan said the cars in two of the pictures , taken for his latest exhibition , belonged to his brother-in-law and a barmaid from a pub in camberwell , south london , and had already been scratched .
the met police had said on monday that if any criminal allegations were made they would be investigated .
mr mcgowan 's latest project is just one of many bizarre stunts by the artist who describes himself as " the british alternative to david blaine " .
in 2003 , he used his nose to push a monkey nut seven miles to 10 downing street in protest against student debt .
he also rolled on pavements for four miles across london singing christmas carols to highlight the work of office cleaners .

mark mcgowan , 37 , said he had taken pictures of himself scratching vehicles ' paintwork as part of a project .
but the london performance artist has since admitted the cars were already " keyed " and the photos were " staged " .
he said it had been an art project that had gone " horribly wrong " and said he was " very , very sorry " .
" i never keyed any cars ... the whole thing has just been a nightmare , " he added .
at least i 've shown people do care about car crime mark mcgowan " all i wanted to do was highlight the plight of people who have had their cars scratched , which has somehow spiralled out of control .
" my family and friends have shunned me and someone rang into a radio show and said they wanted to rip my head off .
" but at least i 've shown people do care about car crime . "
mr mcgowan said the cars in two of the pictures , taken for his latest exhibition , belonged to his brother-in-law and a barmaid from a pub in camberwell , south london , and had already been scratched .
the met police had said on monday that if any criminal allegations were made they would be investigated .
mr mcgowan 's latest project is just one of many bizarre stunts by the artist who describes himself as " the british alternative to david blaine " .
in 2003 , he used his nose to push a monkey nut seven miles to 10 downing street in protest against student debt .
he also rolled on pavements for four miles across london singing christmas carols to highlight the work of office cleaners .

mr law , who has left labour , said he will campaign in protest at the party leadership 's decision to impose an all- women shortlist on the constituency .
he originally dropped plans to fight the seat just two weeks ago because of a brain tumour and underwent surgery .
but on monday , he confirmed he would contest wales ' safest seat after all .
the blaenau gwent am initially threatened to stand 18 months ago if labour used an all-women shortlist to choose a successor to the retiring mp , llew smith .
mr law told bbc wales on tuesday he had recovered well from surgery and had begun to campaign .
' walked over ' he added : " i 'll be in blaina this morning and in ebbw vale .
i 've already been to abertillery and brynmawr - i 'll be out there working with the people .
" i think it -lrb- all-women shortlists -rrb- has become such an issue over the last two years that people became deeply offended they were treated in this way - they 're not here to be walked over .
" if i can facilitate a choice for the people then i 'm pleased to be doing that because their faith and support in me has been so vitally important . "
maggie jones was chosen for labour from an all-women list mr law 's decision posed two immediate problems for labour .
it will have to defend a seat regarded as rock solid , and it has now also lost its working majority in the assembly .
mr law also confirmed on friday that he had left labour , which had held 30 of the 60 assembly seats .
although he will still be an am , he is now an independent .
even if he had not left , under party rules he is considered to have expelled himself by announcing he would stand against a labour candidate .
the selection of maggie jones , a union official with unison , led to the resignations of most of the blaenau gwent party executive .
' protest vote ' labour argues that there are too few women in parliament , and special measures are needed to redress the balance .
maggie jones told bbc wales on tuesday : " we regret peter 's decision to leave the party and stand in this way , but there are bigger issues here .
" what the general election is about is choosing the next government .
it 's not a single issue campaign , it 's about -lrb- labour -rrb- standing on our record .
blaenau gwent is the safest seat in wales " there will always be a small amount of people who wish to exercise a protest vote .
i do n't intend to make this a personal battle - if anything it 's other people attempting to make it personal about me . "
plaid cymru candidate john price said : " peter is fighting this seat because he is annoyed with the way labour has imposed maggie jones on the people of blaenau gwent as their candidate .
" plaid are not going to get involved in the mudslinging that is will probably go on between peter and maggie jones .
" we prefer to concentrate on telling the people of blaenau gwent what we intend and can do -lrb- for them -rrb- . "
conservative candidate phillip lee added : " if peter was n't standing , the media would expect it to be a shoo-in .
" in fact , i suspect that mr blair thought blaenau gwent was in the bag - now he knows it 's not .
" it gives me the opportunity to talk about conservative policies of more police -lrb- and -rrb- lower council tax . "
liberal democrat candidate brian thomas said he was pleased mr law was standing and the seat was a three-way fight between mr law , labour and the lib dems .
" it is a possibility if peter law and maggie jones fight amongst themselves then i could possibly sneak in there and become the member of parliament for blaenau gwent , " mr thomas said .
on 3 april , the day before mr law was originally set to announce his candidacy , he discovered he had a brain tumour .
he initially dropped his plans to contest the seat , and underwent surgery later that week .
labour is defending a 19,313 majority in the seat , which has been held by the nhs ' founding father , aneurin bevan , and former labour leader michael foot .
