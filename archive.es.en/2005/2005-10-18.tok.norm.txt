a controversial figure , schäuble returns to the position which he held under former chancellor helmut kohl . wolfgang schäuble is considered by many to be the most experienced member of chancellor-designate angela merkel 's new coalition government . schäuble , 63 , made his career in the ample shadow of former chancellor kohl when he was considered the chancellor 's closest confidant . merkel 's conservatives named the respected cdu veteran to head the interior ministry , a position he also held from 1989-1991 . schäubles rise to the top wolfgang schäuble is a protestant who was born in freiburg in 1942 . a trained lawyer by profession , he has served as an elected official for over 35 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble survived an assasination attempt by a mentally ill man in 1990 .
confined to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 that left him paralyzed him from the waist down , schäuble is considered one of the architects of german reunification . he served as interior minister in the kohl government and was chief whip of the cdu , building a reputation as a cross-party deal-maker in germany 's complex system of federal government .
during the kohl years he came to be regarded as the chancellor 's political confidante and in return for his loyalty was the only candidate allowed to rise to a position of influence within the party .
when mr kohl finally stepped down , following the cdu 's 1998 election defeat mr schäuble , inherited the leadership of the cdu .
finance scandal damages cdu just over a year after being voted out of office , helmut kohl admitted in a tv interview that the cdu had received approximately two million deutsche marks in secret donations between 1993 and 1998 .
these donations , which were not published in the party 's annual finance reports , were then funnelled back into the coffers of regional and local cdu party branches , to cover campaign costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble was considered by many to be helmut kohls right hand man when the allegations first emerged in 1999 , schäuble promised quick party-wide investigations and acted carefully to minimize political damage to his predecessor and one-time mentor . however by the beginning of 2000 it was clear that the cdu 's funding scandal engulf him as well . schäuble admitted on january 10 , 2000 , that he had received a cash donation of 100,000 dm from karlheinz schreiber , a bavarian businessman and arms dealer .
schäuble declared that this donation had not been published in the party 's official records .
he blamed brigitte baumeister , the former party treasurer , for this " mistake " and denies any personal wrong-doing . reluctant bedfellows ? chancellor-designate merkel took over the leadership of the cdu from schäuble in 2000 . but despite severe criticism from both within and outside of his party schäuble eventually salvaged his reputation and became one of germany 's most respected politicians .
he suffered a setback in 2004 when merkel refused to back him for the role of federal president , preferring the cdu 's former head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , for the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble congratulates angela merkel in 1998 after she was elected as cdu general secretary relations between merkel and schäuble have improved over the years but he is not regarded as a close ally .

" korea is an unknown country in europe .
korean culture is overshadowed by japan and china , " said hwang chi-woo , the author acting as director of the guest of honour delegation . he said his aim was simply to get europeans to talk about his country 's writing and to understand its quiet understatement , which he compared to " the light that softens everything . " a divided country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea is the guest of honor for many of the visiting authors it is also a quest to inform the west of the political plight of the korean peninsula , which was cut in two along the 38th latitude in 1948 , and their longing for reunification with the communist north . " we are all homeless .
i am not from the north or the south , i have no identity apart from the korean language , " the country 's most-read author , hwang sok-yong , told the berlin-based daily newspaper der tagesspiegel . hwang , who spent five years in prison for an unauthorised visit to north korea to promote dialogue between artists from the two states , said the heavily-guarded border between korea 's two halves seemed like a hangover from an era the rest of the world is forgetting . " it all looks like a museum depicting the cold war - it looks like make-believe , " hwang said . lost without translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt book fair focused on arabic literature last year the lack of german translations of korean works has made for a two-year race against time to get some 100 titles ready for the book fair . according to the festival spokeswoman caroline vogel , it proved to be an impossible deadline . " it is very difficult because there are not enough translations and there are not enough translators .

things got worse when a criminal network was uncovered .
the scandal returns as the trial of those involved starts tuesday . it was the scandal that dulled the shine on germany ’ s successful campaign to host the 2006 world cup .
on tuesday , the specter of match-fixing and corruption in german soccer rears its ugly head once again when the disgraced bundesliga referee robert hoyzer and five others come to court to face fraud charges . hoyzer and his alleged cohorts are at the center of germany ’ s biggest sporting embarrassment ; a scandal involving crooked match officials , greedy and corrupt players and a network of gangsters which stretched from germany to turkey and beyond . the affair tells the story of games thrown for money , a widespread illegal betting cartel and the threats and intimidation that went with instigating a match-rigging operation which threatened to undermine the very structure of soccer in germany . trial likely to coincide with world cup draw tuesday 's opening session in berlin 's superior court will reopen wounds inflicted on the game that have barely had time to scab over .
and with the world cup due to kick off in less than nine months , german soccer authorities are hoping that the trial is concluded swiftly .
an on-going process dealing with the most sordid episode in the german game for 30 years would hardly be the best byline for the headlines trumpeting the start of germany ’ s moment in the global soccer sun . with full and partial confessions from all but one of the defendants , the trial is unlikely to still be going on by the time the first ball is kicked on june 8 , 2006 .
however , with sessions initially scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays and with lawyers in the case predicting anything from six to 12 sessions needed to conclude the case , it will almost certainly still be going on when the sport 's most powerful figures gather in leipzig before the draw for the world cup tournament on december 9 . disgraced referee hoyzer back in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer went underground after his release the trial will bring robert hoyzer back into the spotlight and will lay bare once more the details of the 26-year old ’ s involvement as a central figure in the scandal . the berlin-based former referee officiated at matches in the second division and lower leagues in the bundesliga but hit the headlines after it was revealed at the start of 2005 that he took a bribe to throw the result of the german cup first round game between top flight side hamburg sv and regional league side paderborn on august 21 , 2004 . hamburg had been leading 2-0 , but went on to lose 4-2 after hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg striker emile mpenza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei barbarez remonstrates with hoyzer in the notorious match as the investigation went on , it was revealed that hoyzer may have been involved with the fixing or attempted fixing of nine matches in total .
according to reports at the time , further investigation into hoyzer uncovered that he was paid bribes totaling 67,000 euros and was given a flat-screen television . he was arrested in february and spent two weeks in custody .
during his time in incarceration , hoyzer co-operated with berlin prosecutors and the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , who later banned him for life .
he faces 11 charges at trial , including complicity to defraud . official and shamed player face rigging charges as well as hoyer , referee dominik marks and former top flight player steffen karl are charged with involvement in the rigging of matches between april and december last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominik marks maintains his innocence marks has been accused of fixing two matches by hoyzer , one in the second division and the other in the regional northern league .
he was arrested in march 9 and spent four weeks in custody under suspicion of match-fixing .
despite maintaining his innocence , marks faces five charges . karl , a former defensive midfielder for borussia dortmund and hertha berlin , is accused of throwing games for financial gain and faces five charges . all three are accused of involvement under the orders of three croatian brothers who betted on the results .
it is thought that ante sapina , one of the brothers and the alleged gambling ringleader , made over 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.20 million -rrb- on two rigged matches alone . croatians at the heart of betting cartel # b # ante , at 27 the youngest of the three sapina brothers , faces 42 charges including the running of an illegal match-fixing operation .
the 40-year old eldest brother milan faces 11 charges of betting on rigged matches while 37-year old filip , who has apparently co-operated with investigators , faces four similar charges . the defendants will be required to enter a plea at the beginning of the trial with all – except marks – expected to plead guilty .
the offences could bring jail terms of up to 10 years , although lawyers from the defense counsel hope that the confessions and a lack of previous convictions will lead to sentences nearer the one year minimum . investigation uncovers widespread corruption in total , berlin prosecutors have investigated 25 people in connection with the scandal , many of whom are suspected of having been involved in manipulating at least 10 matches in 2004 .
there have also been 14 players investigated , from second division clubs energie cottbus , dynamo dresden and regional sides chemnitzer fc , kickers offenbach and sc paderborn . prosecutors have also seized 2.44 million euros in bank accounts and of assets belonging to the three sapina brothers during february raids . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a shadow over german soccer german soccer has struggled recently .

however , with sessions initially scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays and with lawyers in the case predicting anything from six to 12 sessions needed to conclude the case , it will almost certainly still be going on when the sport 's most powerful figures gather in leipzig before the draw for the world cup tournament on december 9 . disgraced referee hoyzer back in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer went underground after his release the trial will bring robert hoyzer back into the spotlight and will lay bare once more the details of the 26-year old ’ s involvement as a central figure in the scandal . the berlin-based former referee officiated at matches in the second division and lower leagues in the bundesliga but hit the headlines after it was revealed at the start of 2005 that he took a bribe to throw the result of the german cup first round game between top flight side hamburg sv and regional league side paderborn on august 21 , 2004 . hamburg had been leading 2-0 , but went on to lose 4-2 after hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg striker emile mpenza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei barbarez remonstrates with hoyzer in the notorious match as the investigation went on , it was revealed that hoyzer may have been involved with the fixing or attempted fixing of nine matches in total .
according to reports at the time , further investigation into hoyzer uncovered that he was paid bribes totaling 67,000 euros and was given a flat-screen television . he was arrested in february and spent two weeks in custody .
during his time in incarceration , hoyzer co-operated with berlin prosecutors and the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , who later banned him for life .
he faces 11 charges at trial , including complicity to defraud . official and shamed player face rigging charges as well as hoyer , referee dominik marks and former top flight player steffen karl are charged with involvement in the rigging of matches between april and december last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominik marks maintains his innocence marks has been accused of fixing two matches by hoyzer , one in the second division and the other in the regional northern league .
he was arrested in march 9 and spent four weeks in custody under suspicion of match-fixing .
despite maintaining his innocence , marks faces five charges . karl , a former defensive midfielder for borussia dortmund and hertha berlin , is accused of throwing games for financial gain and faces five charges . all three are accused of involvement under the orders of three croatian brothers who betted on the results .

things got worse when a criminal network was uncovered .
the scandal returns as the trial of those involved starts tuesday . it was the scandal that dulled the shine on germany ’ s successful campaign to host the 2006 world cup .
on tuesday , the specter of match-fixing and corruption in german soccer rears its ugly head once again when the disgraced bundesliga referee robert hoyzer and five others come to court to face fraud charges . hoyzer and his alleged cohorts are at the center of germany ’ s biggest sporting embarrassment ; a scandal involving crooked match officials , greedy and corrupt players and a network of gangsters which stretched from germany to turkey and beyond . the affair tells the story of games thrown for money , a widespread illegal betting cartel and the threats and intimidation that went with instigating a match-rigging operation which threatened to undermine the very structure of soccer in germany . trial likely to coincide with world cup draw tuesday 's opening session in berlin 's superior court will reopen wounds inflicted on the game that have barely had time to scab over .
and with the world cup due to kick off in less than nine months , german soccer authorities are hoping that the trial is concluded swiftly .
an on-going process dealing with the most sordid episode in the german game for 30 years would hardly be the best byline for the headlines trumpeting the start of germany ’ s moment in the global soccer sun . with full and partial confessions from all but one of the defendants , the trial is unlikely to still be going on by the time the first ball is kicked on june 8 , 2006 .

" france supports the spanish idea of a european-african conference on immigration , " french prime minister dominique de villepin said on monday after holding discussions with his spanish counterpart jose luis rodriguez zapatero in barcelona . " all of our countries are confronted today with this question of immigration .

" spain and france will present a joint initiative at the next european council on a global plan on a response to immigration ... which commits the eu much more than it has been up to now , " prime minister zapatero told the press conference . the issue came to a head last month with a series of assaults by thousands of sub-saharan african immigrants on fencing at the spanish border surrounding the north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla - africa 's only land border with the eu . deaths and mayhem at spain 's african border at least 14 people have died in their attempt to leap over the heavily defended borders after trekking across vast swathes of africa to northern morocco .

the reasoning behind this policy being that if better opportunities existed at home , there would be less reason for migrants to risk their lives in attempting to reach the wealthy eu . zapatero told his french counterpart that illegal immigration from sub-saharan africa was an issue that concerned the whole of africa and europe and one that morocco and spain could not deal with alone . zapatero calls on eu to avert " humanitarian drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero spoke to chirac about the immigration issue .
" europe refuses to take the african immigrants , but spain and morocco can not play the role of eu policeman on their own , " a spanish spokesman told afp on behalf of the prime minister , adding it was " time to act " to solve a " humanitarian drama . "
zapatero himself revealed that he had spoken directly by phone with french president jacques chirac about the issue . as well as storming the borders around ceuta and melilla , thousands more african migrants take to rickety boats each year in a perilous trip to the canary islands or across the gibraltar strait to southern spain .

the infected turkey came from a small private poultry farm on the tiny island , and the authorities there have confirmed that they will cull all the other birds and medically examine the farmer 's family . the european union commission responded to the latest discovery by saying it would ban the export of live birds and bird related products from the chios area .
and the island 's prefect , polidoras lambrinoudis told the reuters news agency that no poultry or eggs were now allowed to leave the island .

some countries have poor public health infrastructures and no stockpiles of the expensive anti-viral drugs which could help to limit a human pandemic . millions of birds in the region have already been culled in an attempt to stop the spread of the h5n1 strain , which first emerged in hong kong in 1997 . europe is keen to strike a balance between testing for outbreaks of the deadly bird flu and the need to play down the threat to the public .

" it is conceivable , but minimal . " but who influenza program director klaus stoehr warns of the devastating consequences if the disease is not contained . " we do n't know whether a pandemic will break out in the coming weeks , months , or only in years .
but there 's no question that if such a pandemic occurs we 'll be looking at hundreds of thousands or even millions of deaths worldwide , " he said . chicken is off the menu consumers across europe are responding to the westward spread of bird flu by turning away from chicken and other poultry .
reassurances that cooking chicken at temperatures above 160 degrees fahrenheit destroys the virus have done little to allay fears , with farmers and supermarkets across much of the continent reporting a drop in sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers in southern europe are reportedly off poultry farmers in turkey say that poultry sales have fallen by 50 percent , and several restaurants have already removed white meat from their menus .

things got worse when a criminal network was uncovered .
the scandal returns as the trial of those involved starts tuesday . it was the scandal that dulled the shine on germany ’ s successful campaign to host the 2006 world cup .
on tuesday , the specter of match-fixing and corruption in german soccer rears its ugly head once again when the disgraced bundesliga referee robert hoyzer and five others come to court to face fraud charges . hoyzer and his alleged cohorts are at the center of germany ’ s biggest sporting embarrassment ; a scandal involving crooked match officials , greedy and corrupt players and a network of gangsters which stretched from germany to turkey and beyond . the affair tells the story of games thrown for money , a widespread illegal betting cartel and the threats and intimidation that went with instigating a match-rigging operation which threatened to undermine the very structure of soccer in germany . trial likely to coincide with world cup draw tuesday 's opening session in berlin 's superior court will reopen wounds inflicted on the game that have barely had time to scab over .
and with the world cup due to kick off in less than nine months , german soccer authorities are hoping that the trial is concluded swiftly .
an on-going process dealing with the most sordid episode in the german game for 30 years would hardly be the best byline for the headlines trumpeting the start of germany ’ s moment in the global soccer sun . with full and partial confessions from all but one of the defendants , the trial is unlikely to still be going on by the time the first ball is kicked on june 8 , 2006 .
however , with sessions initially scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays and with lawyers in the case predicting anything from six to 12 sessions needed to conclude the case , it will almost certainly still be going on when the sport 's most powerful figures gather in leipzig before the draw for the world cup tournament on december 9 . disgraced referee hoyzer back in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer went underground after his release the trial will bring robert hoyzer back into the spotlight and will lay bare once more the details of the 26-year old ’ s involvement as a central figure in the scandal . the berlin-based former referee officiated at matches in the second division and lower leagues in the bundesliga but hit the headlines after it was revealed at the start of 2005 that he took a bribe to throw the result of the german cup first round game between top flight side hamburg sv and regional league side paderborn on august 21 , 2004 . hamburg had been leading 2-0 , but went on to lose 4-2 after hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg striker emile mpenza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei barbarez remonstrates with hoyzer in the notorious match as the investigation went on , it was revealed that hoyzer may have been involved with the fixing or attempted fixing of nine matches in total .
according to reports at the time , further investigation into hoyzer uncovered that he was paid bribes totaling 67,000 euros and was given a flat-screen television . he was arrested in february and spent two weeks in custody .
during his time in incarceration , hoyzer co-operated with berlin prosecutors and the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , who later banned him for life .
he faces 11 charges at trial , including complicity to defraud . official and shamed player face rigging charges as well as hoyer , referee dominik marks and former top flight player steffen karl are charged with involvement in the rigging of matches between april and december last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominik marks maintains his innocence marks has been accused of fixing two matches by hoyzer , one in the second division and the other in the regional northern league .

despite maintaining his innocence , marks faces five charges . karl , a former defensive midfielder for borussia dortmund and hertha berlin , is accused of throwing games for financial gain and faces five charges . all three are accused of involvement under the orders of three croatian brothers who betted on the results .

the offences could bring jail terms of up to 10 years , although lawyers from the defense counsel hope that the confessions and a lack of previous convictions will lead to sentences nearer the one year minimum . investigation uncovers widespread corruption in total , berlin prosecutors have investigated 25 people in connection with the scandal , many of whom are suspected of having been involved in manipulating at least 10 matches in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.10.2005 spain , france join forces on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are prepared to go to any length to enter the eu spain and france have announced that they will propose a joint plan for a european-african conference on immigration at a european union summit later this month . the plan will be supported at the meeting by the french who gave their public backing to the proposal which will be presented at the summit in britain on oct .
27 and 28 . " france supports the spanish idea of a european-african conference on immigration , " french prime minister dominique de villepin said on monday after holding discussions with his spanish counterpart jose luis rodriguez zapatero in barcelona . " all of our countries are confronted today with this question of immigration .
we should treat it with courage , daring and imagination , " de villepin added . " spain and france will present a joint initiative at the next european council on a global plan on a response to immigration ... which commits the eu much more than it has been up to now , " prime minister zapatero told the press conference . the issue came to a head last month with a series of assaults by thousands of sub-saharan african immigrants on fencing at the spanish border surrounding the north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla - africa 's only land border with the eu . deaths and mayhem at spain 's african border at least 14 people have died in their attempt to leap over the heavily defended borders after trekking across vast swathes of africa to northern morocco .
some of them have been shot by moroccan security forces while desperately attempting to reach a better life in europe . bildunterschrift : african immigrants in a transit camp near spain after struggling for some time to keep the waves of immigrants from swamping its borders , spain has repeatedly called on the eu to get a grip on the roots of the illegal immigration problem by aiding the poor african countries from where migrants originate .
the reasoning behind this policy being that if better opportunities existed at home , there would be less reason for migrants to risk their lives in attempting to reach the wealthy eu . zapatero told his french counterpart that illegal immigration from sub-saharan africa was an issue that concerned the whole of africa and europe and one that morocco and spain could not deal with alone . zapatero calls on eu to avert " humanitarian drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero spoke to chirac about the immigration issue .
" europe refuses to take the african immigrants , but spain and morocco can not play the role of eu policeman on their own , " a spanish spokesman told afp on behalf of the prime minister , adding it was " time to act " to solve a " humanitarian drama . "
zapatero himself revealed that he had spoken directly by phone with french president jacques chirac about the issue . as well as storming the borders around ceuta and melilla , thousands more african migrants take to rickety boats each year in a perilous trip to the canary islands or across the gibraltar strait to southern spain .
many don ’ t make it across alive . french pm sketches out two-pronged strategy while zapatero provided no details of the proposal , de villepin hinted at a two-pronged strategy which would combine improving controls along the border regions with a development and training program in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin .
the french prime minister added that transit countries for immigrants should also be given support in protecting their borders under a new , broad european immigration policy . spain annoyed some of its eu partners earlier this year by giving documentation to hundreds of thousands of immigrants who had been working illegally in spain and then had irritated them further recently by allowing “ thousands ” more to enter spain .. neighbors " irritated " by spanish policy the spanish daily abc reported that the french and german interior ministers had complained " this week " about spain 's immigration policy , saying " 25,000 illegals from black africa have crossed the pyrenees in the past few months " to france , belgium and the netherlands . quoting police experts , abc said another 25,000 were still in spain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily the paper added that french interior minister nicolas sarkozy had called the spanish government the " sorcerer 's apprentice " in terms of immigration and called the country “ an open door ” while the paper quoted german counterpart otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- as saying that " massive -lrb- immigrant -rrb- regularization has the knock-on effect of attracting new illegals .

a controversial figure , schäuble returns to the position which he held under former chancellor helmut kohl . wolfgang schäuble is considered by many to be the most experienced member of chancellor-designate angela merkel 's new coalition government . schäuble , 63 , made his career in the ample shadow of former chancellor kohl when he was considered the chancellor 's closest confidant . merkel 's conservatives named the respected cdu veteran to head the interior ministry , a position he also held from 1989-1991 . schäubles rise to the top wolfgang schäuble is a protestant who was born in freiburg in 1942 . a trained lawyer by profession , he has served as an elected official for over 35 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble survived an assasination attempt by a mentally ill man in 1990 .
confined to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 that left him paralyzed him from the waist down , schäuble is considered one of the architects of german reunification . he served as interior minister in the kohl government and was chief whip of the cdu , building a reputation as a cross-party deal-maker in germany 's complex system of federal government .
during the kohl years he came to be regarded as the chancellor 's political confidante and in return for his loyalty was the only candidate allowed to rise to a position of influence within the party .
when mr kohl finally stepped down , following the cdu 's 1998 election defeat mr schäuble , inherited the leadership of the cdu .
finance scandal damages cdu just over a year after being voted out of office , helmut kohl admitted in a tv interview that the cdu had received approximately two million deutsche marks in secret donations between 1993 and 1998 .
these donations , which were not published in the party 's annual finance reports , were then funnelled back into the coffers of regional and local cdu party branches , to cover campaign costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble was considered by many to be helmut kohls right hand man when the allegations first emerged in 1999 , schäuble promised quick party-wide investigations and acted carefully to minimize political damage to his predecessor and one-time mentor . however by the beginning of 2000 it was clear that the cdu 's funding scandal engulf him as well . schäuble admitted on january 10 , 2000 , that he had received a cash donation of 100,000 dm from karlheinz schreiber , a bavarian businessman and arms dealer .
schäuble declared that this donation had not been published in the party 's official records .
he blamed brigitte baumeister , the former party treasurer , for this " mistake " and denies any personal wrong-doing . reluctant bedfellows ? chancellor-designate merkel took over the leadership of the cdu from schäuble in 2000 . but despite severe criticism from both within and outside of his party schäuble eventually salvaged his reputation and became one of germany 's most respected politicians .
he suffered a setback in 2004 when merkel refused to back him for the role of federal president , preferring the cdu 's former head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , for the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble congratulates angela merkel in 1998 after she was elected as cdu general secretary relations between merkel and schäuble have improved over the years but he is not regarded as a close ally .
still , many observers say merkel is turning to him now because she knows his political know-how will be essential if a potentially fractious government is to work . merkel has a history of sidelining party rivals and that has left her with few experienced conservative allies for top posts .
her party 's unexpectedly poor result in a sept .
18 election likewise curbed her ability to dictate who will be in her team .
as for his role as the country 's top security official , schäuble is likely to take just as tough a line on law and order as his social democrat predecessor otto schily . dw staff -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel announces german cabinet after playing tug-of-war with her own party , germany 's chancellor-designate , angela merkel , named her cabinet members on monday , ahead of coalition talks aimed at forming the new government .

at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .
they want to know about the things that affect them directly .
which taxes will be raised or lowered ?
will their pensions rise or fall ?
will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?
will driving on the country 's freeways remain free of charge ? all of these questions will be addressed in the coming four weeks of coalition negotiations .
in this respect , the last month , while high drama for journalists , was wasted time in the eyes of most citizens . people are interested in results , even the kind of results that they suspect will be painful .
at the same time , that 's exactly what they are afraid of .
of course people know that five million unemployed will , over time , prove the ruin of the welfare state .
they 're aware that the public coffers are already in critical condition .
but they are very afraid of the actions that need to be taken to solve these problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans voted for reform , but not too much of it it is because the union parties prescribed bitter medicine to address germany 's ills during their election campaign that they did so poorly on election day .
and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .
the remaining tasks at hand could then be tackled by the next government , whatever its composition may be . felix steiner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

" we are only talking about material damage , " kaczynski , who is warsaw 's present-day mayor , told reporters at a briefing . although kaczynski , who is trailing liberal candidate donald tusk in the race for the presidency , which goes to a second round on sunday , denied he was using the lingering animosity between poland and germany to try to win votes , political analyst stanislaw mocek read the opposite into his tactic .

" work on this report was begun in may 2004 ; it is not linked in any way whatsoever to the electoral calendar , " he told journalists , before recalling his suspicion of poland 's large neighbour to the west , germany , and stressing that poland " needs a president who speaks out decisively , not a president who is open to compromise , as the german press presents donald tusk . " the report , nearly 700 pages long and entitled " warsaw 's losses between 1939 and 1945 , " was commissioned in response to announcements that germans who were expelled from areas in western poland at the end of the war intended to seek compensation for property they had to leave behind . " if germany insists on rewriting history , if there are more demands for compensation ... we have a weapon to defend ourselves with this report , " kaczynski said . " there was no other city in occupied europe which lost more than half its inhabitants and was more than 80 percent destroyed , as was warsaw , " he said . " the germans can not be allowed to present themselves as the second victims of world war two after the jews . " strategy already used fanning the abiding distrust of germany has already been used in the election campaign . last week , kaczynski 's election team accused tusk 's grandfather of fighting in the german army in world war ii , an accusation tusk said " overstepped the bounds of decency " - and which cost kaczynski 's campaign chief jacek kurski his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi troops march into poland in 1939 world war two started with the german invasion of poland , and accusations of collaborating with the nazis during the war still hit home , more than half a century later . " kaczynski always puts himself forward as the only good guy , " said mocek . but neither his accusations about tusk 's grandfather being in the wehrmacht , nor the report on nazi destruction in warsaw , appeared to have done the conservative presidential candidate much good . five days before the second round , opinion polls put tusk in the lead with around 58 percent of the vote , with kaczynski about 15 points behind him . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , warsaw head for cool spell strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.10.2005 polish politician plays anti-german card großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's anti-german strategy has been meant to woo older voters conservative lech kaczynski played on poles ' lingering fears of germany to try to woo voters for the presidency when he presented a report on the devastation caused by the nazis in warsaw in world war ii . in today 's money , nazi germany caused at least 45.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in damage to the polish capital during the war , kaczynski , who is mayor of warsaw , said as he presented a report on the 1939 - 1945 nazi occupation . " we are only talking about material damage , " kaczynski , who is warsaw 's present-day mayor , told reporters at a briefing . although kaczynski , who is trailing liberal candidate donald tusk in the race for the presidency , which goes to a second round on sunday , denied he was using the lingering animosity between poland and germany to try to win votes , political analyst stanislaw mocek read the opposite into his tactic . " it is surely no fluke that he presented this report today .
it is clearly a new element of his campaign , " said mocek of the polish academy of sciences . " kaczynski is trying to win over older voters who still vividly remember the war .
to the young , the past does n't mean much , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk , presidential candidate from the civic platform party " he is also trying to win votes in the west of the country , in regions that were german before the war , " said mocek .
tusk scored a clear win in the west in the first round of the vote . " not linked in any way " but kaczynski insisted the report was not tied to the election . " work on this report was begun in may 2004 ; it is not linked in any way whatsoever to the electoral calendar , " he told journalists , before recalling his suspicion of poland 's large neighbour to the west , germany , and stressing that poland " needs a president who speaks out decisively , not a president who is open to compromise , as the german press presents donald tusk . " the report , nearly 700 pages long and entitled " warsaw 's losses between 1939 and 1945 , " was commissioned in response to announcements that germans who were expelled from areas in western poland at the end of the war intended to seek compensation for property they had to leave behind . " if germany insists on rewriting history , if there are more demands for compensation ... we have a weapon to defend ourselves with this report , " kaczynski said . " there was no other city in occupied europe which lost more than half its inhabitants and was more than 80 percent destroyed , as was warsaw , " he said . " the germans can not be allowed to present themselves as the second victims of world war two after the jews . " strategy already used fanning the abiding distrust of germany has already been used in the election campaign . last week , kaczynski 's election team accused tusk 's grandfather of fighting in the german army in world war ii , an accusation tusk said " overstepped the bounds of decency " - and which cost kaczynski 's campaign chief jacek kurski his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi troops march into poland in 1939 world war two started with the german invasion of poland , and accusations of collaborating with the nazis during the war still hit home , more than half a century later . " kaczynski always puts himself forward as the only good guy , " said mocek . but neither his accusations about tusk 's grandfather being in the wehrmacht , nor the report on nazi destruction in warsaw , appeared to have done the conservative presidential candidate much good . five days before the second round , opinion polls put tusk in the lead with around 58 percent of the vote , with kaczynski about 15 points behind him . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , warsaw head for cool spell strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .

some subsidy backers say brussels is keeping them in the dark . first came the proposal to reduce agricultural subsidies ; then came the backlash . peter mandelson , the eu trade commissioner , called for reducing subsidies under the bloc 's common agricultural policy by 70 percent and farm import duties by 60 percent after 2013 . then france , along with a dozen other members , called an emergency meeting tuesday to tie his hands .
they accused him of exceeding his mandate , offering too many concessions in negotiations , and want him restricted before he goes to hong kong in december . france 's main farm union , fnsea , accused mandelson of " sacrificing european agriculture on the altar of economic and social deregulation , " saying thousands of jobs were threatened . not over yet mandelson has been pressuring member states to give him the negotiating power to allow him to reach a deal over farm subsidies , which he says would be to everyone 's benefit - both developing and industrial nations . trade experts say progress on cutting subsidies that developed nations pay to their farmers is crucial to agreeing on a global trade back at wto talks in hong kong in december , which could boost or hinder the world economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson wants his hands untied " the world trade talks are important for all of us , including many developing countries , " he told reporters .
" so it is very important that we are allowed to go forwards and not backwards . " eleven of the union 's 25 members , including britain , support easing subsidies and tariffs during wto negotiations . mandelson has said that his initiative to lower subsidies does not exceed his mandate and denies that he is british prime minister tony blair 's lackey .
blair and french president jacques chirac have fought frequently over eu farm subsidies , which total over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- a year and largely benefit the french . european farmers warn eu meanwhile , european farmers reiterated their demands tuesday that the european commission stay within its mandate , echoing the french government . jean-michel lemetayer , head of the french farmers ' group caf , said that the commission had to know " the limits not to go past , " particularly on the issue of opening up the european market to imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamy wants to see a deal addressing the meeting of 650 members of agriculture groups from across europe , the director-general of the wto , pascal lamy , tried to reassuring those present . " my conviction is that european farmers have no reason to be on the defensive , " lamy said .
" with these negotiations you have the opportunity to win a double dividend , " he said , because european farmers could benefit from agricultural reforms within the european union and from trade reforms by other members of the wto , which could give european manufacturers more access to fast-growing markets like brazil and india . lamy added that the united states had accepted the principle of reducing their agricultural subsidies and that the eu had to demonstrate " greater flexibility " in return .
the us has said europe needs to go further with agricultural subsidy reform . but anxieties within the farming community that the eu commission might go too far in reducing support for its farmers were backed by the president of the agricultural commission in the european parliament , joseph daul . daul said that he had " the painful feeling that the eu is capitulating at the wto . " dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new wto chief faces daunting task the task facing pascal lamy as head of the world trade organization is indeed daunting .

some subsidy backers say brussels is keeping them in the dark . first came the proposal to reduce agricultural subsidies ; then came the backlash . peter mandelson , the eu trade commissioner , called for reducing subsidies under the bloc 's common agricultural policy by 70 percent and farm import duties by 60 percent after 2013 . then france , along with a dozen other members , called an emergency meeting tuesday to tie his hands .
they accused him of exceeding his mandate , offering too many concessions in negotiations , and want him restricted before he goes to hong kong in december . france 's main farm union , fnsea , accused mandelson of " sacrificing european agriculture on the altar of economic and social deregulation , " saying thousands of jobs were threatened . not over yet mandelson has been pressuring member states to give him the negotiating power to allow him to reach a deal over farm subsidies , which he says would be to everyone 's benefit - both developing and industrial nations . trade experts say progress on cutting subsidies that developed nations pay to their farmers is crucial to agreeing on a global trade back at wto talks in hong kong in december , which could boost or hinder the world economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson wants his hands untied " the world trade talks are important for all of us , including many developing countries , " he told reporters .
" so it is very important that we are allowed to go forwards and not backwards . " eleven of the union 's 25 members , including britain , support easing subsidies and tariffs during wto negotiations . mandelson has said that his initiative to lower subsidies does not exceed his mandate and denies that he is british prime minister tony blair 's lackey .
blair and french president jacques chirac have fought frequently over eu farm subsidies , which total over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- a year and largely benefit the french . european farmers warn eu meanwhile , european farmers reiterated their demands tuesday that the european commission stay within its mandate , echoing the french government . jean-michel lemetayer , head of the french farmers ' group caf , said that the commission had to know " the limits not to go past , " particularly on the issue of opening up the european market to imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamy wants to see a deal addressing the meeting of 650 members of agriculture groups from across europe , the director-general of the wto , pascal lamy , tried to reassuring those present . " my conviction is that european farmers have no reason to be on the defensive , " lamy said .
" with these negotiations you have the opportunity to win a double dividend , " he said , because european farmers could benefit from agricultural reforms within the european union and from trade reforms by other members of the wto , which could give european manufacturers more access to fast-growing markets like brazil and india . lamy added that the united states had accepted the principle of reducing their agricultural subsidies and that the eu had to demonstrate " greater flexibility " in return .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.10.2005 federal reform : a critical first step großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rethinking federal and state responsibilities is critical now that angela merkel 's cabinet has been named , it 's time for the hard work to begin .
at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .
they want to know about the things that affect them directly .
which taxes will be raised or lowered ?
will their pensions rise or fall ?
will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?
will driving on the country 's freeways remain free of charge ? all of these questions will be addressed in the coming four weeks of coalition negotiations .
in this respect , the last month , while high drama for journalists , was wasted time in the eyes of most citizens . people are interested in results , even the kind of results that they suspect will be painful .
at the same time , that 's exactly what they are afraid of .
of course people know that five million unemployed will , over time , prove the ruin of the welfare state .
they 're aware that the public coffers are already in critical condition .
but they are very afraid of the actions that need to be taken to solve these problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans voted for reform , but not too much of it it is because the union parties prescribed bitter medicine to address germany 's ills during their election campaign that they did so poorly on election day .
and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .
the remaining tasks at hand could then be tackled by the next government , whatever its composition may be . felix steiner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .
-lrb- oct .
11 , 2005 -rrb- what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .
but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question .

at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .
they want to know about the things that affect them directly .
which taxes will be raised or lowered ?

will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?

and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .

the bundestag is expected to sit in mid-november to formally elect merkel as chancellor . " we must take this criticism seriously " the oldest member of the bundestag , interior minster otto schilly officially opened the session .
afterwards , norbert lammert , a christian democrat who has been a member of parliament for 25 years , was elected its new speaker , replacing social democrat wolfgang thierse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new speaker , nobert lammert -lrb- left -rrb- , with angela merkel " neither germany ’ s parties and parliament nor the government and opposition are currently highly regarded by the german public , " said lammert .
" we must take this criticism seriously , because the huge challenges our country is facing can only be tackled if germans regain trust in their political institutions . " merkel 's christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , have 226 seats in the lower house , just four more than schröder 's social democrats .
despite having given up his ambitions of serving a third term as chancellor , schröder retains a seat in the bundestag . attack on all fronts the rest of the parliament is made up by the free democrats with 61 seats , the 54 lawmakers of the left party - a mix of former communists and disgruntled social democrats - and the former governing coalition partners , the greens , who have 51 seats . germany ’ s new left party already vowed to attack the new government , especially on its social policies .
the party unites former east german communists with former leftwing spd members who were critical of gerhard schröder ’ s economic and welfare reforms , which they described as unfair to the poor .
the environmentalist greens are convinced that neither the government nor the two other opposition parties are sufficiently committed to environmentally sound policies . problems at home ? meanwhile , the german press on tuesday predicted problems ahead for merkel from her own camp following the nomination of seehofer to the agriculture ministry . known for his stance on the left wing of the conservatives , seehofer has clashed with merkel over her proposals to reform the health service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trouble from within - edmund stoiber and merkel have their differences edmund stoiber , the head of the csu and the new economy minister , insisted on seehofer 's nomination to government in exchange for his support . " stoiber could not have brought a stronger merkel opponent into the cabinet , " commented the left-wing tageszeitung daily . other newspapers said seehofer was likely to side with the eight social democrat ministers in the government in opposing large-scale reforms . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de federal reform : a critical first step now that angela merkel 's cabinet has been named , it 's time for the hard work to begin .

some are not surprised . this year , germany ranked the 16th cleanest country out of 159 surveyed , according to transparency international 's corruption perception index 2005 , slipping from its 15th place finish last year .
some officials are attributing the slide to recent scandals and to a lack of government anti-corruption measures .
" the frequency of corruption cases that we have had to deal with in the past months has taken some people by surprise , but not us . "
peter von blomberg with transparency deutschland , the local arm of the organization , told german news agency dpa . he referred to recent corruption scandals such as the one plaguing germany 's stock exchange and added that instead of tackling corruption problems themselves , representatives of the business community have been fighting the publication of corruption studies such as this latest one . iceland is cleanest the corruption survey reports that serious levels of corruption exist in two thirds of the 159 countries examined , and that there was a clear link between poverty and corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty breeds corruption , transparency says the report found that chad , bangladesh , turkmenistan and myanmar were perceived as the most corrupt countries in the world , while iceland was the cleanest .
most of the countries that landed at the bottom of the list were in africa , while those which came in at the top were industrialized asian and western countries . the nations perceived as the most corrupt also rank among the world 's poorest , which shows how corruption and poverty feed off each other , according to the report . " corruption is a major cause of poverty as well as a barrier to overcoming it , " locking poor countries in " a cycle of misery , " said transparency international chairman peter eigen .
" corruption must be vigorously addressed if aid is to make a real difference in freeing people from poverty . " severe corruption problem despite progress on many fronts , including the soon-to-be-implemented united nations convention against corruption , 70 countries scored less than three on the cpi , indicating a severe corruption problem , the report said . the cpi index score relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business people and country analysts and ranges between 10 , which is highly clean and zero , which is highly corrupt . for example , the united states was ranked 17th with a score of 7.6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says countries must do more against corruption iceland topped the list with a score of 9.7 , followed by finland -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , new zealand -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , denmark -lrb- 9.5 -rrb- , singapore -lrb- 9.4 -rrb- , sweden -lrb- 9.2 -rrb- , switzerland -lrb- 9.1 -rrb- norway -lrb- 8.9 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 8.8 -rrb- and austria -lrb- 8.7 -rrb- . ahead of germany 's score of 8.2 were the netherlands , britain , luxembourg , canada and hong kong .
france , belgium and ireland came in at 18th , 19th and 20th , respectively .

the bundestag is expected to sit in mid-november to formally elect merkel as chancellor . " we must take this criticism seriously " the oldest member of the bundestag , interior minster otto schilly officially opened the session .
afterwards , norbert lammert , a christian democrat who has been a member of parliament for 25 years , was elected its new speaker , replacing social democrat wolfgang thierse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new speaker , nobert lammert -lrb- left -rrb- , with angela merkel " neither germany ’ s parties and parliament nor the government and opposition are currently highly regarded by the german public , " said lammert .
" we must take this criticism seriously , because the huge challenges our country is facing can only be tackled if germans regain trust in their political institutions .

" we are only talking about material damage , " kaczynski , who is warsaw 's present-day mayor , told reporters at a briefing . although kaczynski , who is trailing liberal candidate donald tusk in the race for the presidency , which goes to a second round on sunday , denied he was using the lingering animosity between poland and germany to try to win votes , political analyst stanislaw mocek read the opposite into his tactic . " it is surely no fluke that he presented this report today .
it is clearly a new element of his campaign , " said mocek of the polish academy of sciences . " kaczynski is trying to win over older voters who still vividly remember the war .
to the young , the past does n't mean much , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk , presidential candidate from the civic platform party " he is also trying to win votes in the west of the country , in regions that were german before the war , " said mocek .
tusk scored a clear win in the west in the first round of the vote . " not linked in any way " but kaczynski insisted the report was not tied to the election . " work on this report was begun in may 2004 ; it is not linked in any way whatsoever to the electoral calendar , " he told journalists , before recalling his suspicion of poland 's large neighbour to the west , germany , and stressing that poland " needs a president who speaks out decisively , not a president who is open to compromise , as the german press presents donald tusk . " the report , nearly 700 pages long and entitled " warsaw 's losses between 1939 and 1945 , " was commissioned in response to announcements that germans who were expelled from areas in western poland at the end of the war intended to seek compensation for property they had to leave behind . " if germany insists on rewriting history , if there are more demands for compensation ... we have a weapon to defend ourselves with this report , " kaczynski said . " there was no other city in occupied europe which lost more than half its inhabitants and was more than 80 percent destroyed , as was warsaw , " he said . " the germans can not be allowed to present themselves as the second victims of world war two after the jews . " strategy already used fanning the abiding distrust of germany has already been used in the election campaign . last week , kaczynski 's election team accused tusk 's grandfather of fighting in the german army in world war ii , an accusation tusk said " overstepped the bounds of decency " - and which cost kaczynski 's campaign chief jacek kurski his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi troops march into poland in 1939 world war two started with the german invasion of poland , and accusations of collaborating with the nazis during the war still hit home , more than half a century later . " kaczynski always puts himself forward as the only good guy , " said mocek . but neither his accusations about tusk 's grandfather being in the wehrmacht , nor the report on nazi destruction in warsaw , appeared to have done the conservative presidential candidate much good . five days before the second round , opinion polls put tusk in the lead with around 58 percent of the vote , with kaczynski about 15 points behind him . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , warsaw head for cool spell strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.10.2005 spain , france join forces on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are prepared to go to any length to enter the eu spain and france have announced that they will propose a joint plan for a european-african conference on immigration at a european union summit later this month . the plan will be supported at the meeting by the french who gave their public backing to the proposal which will be presented at the summit in britain on oct .
27 and 28 . " france supports the spanish idea of a european-african conference on immigration , " french prime minister dominique de villepin said on monday after holding discussions with his spanish counterpart jose luis rodriguez zapatero in barcelona . " all of our countries are confronted today with this question of immigration .
we should treat it with courage , daring and imagination , " de villepin added . " spain and france will present a joint initiative at the next european council on a global plan on a response to immigration ... which commits the eu much more than it has been up to now , " prime minister zapatero told the press conference . the issue came to a head last month with a series of assaults by thousands of sub-saharan african immigrants on fencing at the spanish border surrounding the north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla - africa 's only land border with the eu . deaths and mayhem at spain 's african border at least 14 people have died in their attempt to leap over the heavily defended borders after trekking across vast swathes of africa to northern morocco .
some of them have been shot by moroccan security forces while desperately attempting to reach a better life in europe . bildunterschrift : african immigrants in a transit camp near spain after struggling for some time to keep the waves of immigrants from swamping its borders , spain has repeatedly called on the eu to get a grip on the roots of the illegal immigration problem by aiding the poor african countries from where migrants originate .
the reasoning behind this policy being that if better opportunities existed at home , there would be less reason for migrants to risk their lives in attempting to reach the wealthy eu . zapatero told his french counterpart that illegal immigration from sub-saharan africa was an issue that concerned the whole of africa and europe and one that morocco and spain could not deal with alone . zapatero calls on eu to avert " humanitarian drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero spoke to chirac about the immigration issue .
" europe refuses to take the african immigrants , but spain and morocco can not play the role of eu policeman on their own , " a spanish spokesman told afp on behalf of the prime minister , adding it was " time to act " to solve a " humanitarian drama . "
zapatero himself revealed that he had spoken directly by phone with french president jacques chirac about the issue . as well as storming the borders around ceuta and melilla , thousands more african migrants take to rickety boats each year in a perilous trip to the canary islands or across the gibraltar strait to southern spain .
many don ’ t make it across alive . french pm sketches out two-pronged strategy while zapatero provided no details of the proposal , de villepin hinted at a two-pronged strategy which would combine improving controls along the border regions with a development and training program in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin .
the french prime minister added that transit countries for immigrants should also be given support in protecting their borders under a new , broad european immigration policy . spain annoyed some of its eu partners earlier this year by giving documentation to hundreds of thousands of immigrants who had been working illegally in spain and then had irritated them further recently by allowing “ thousands ” more to enter spain .. neighbors " irritated " by spanish policy the spanish daily abc reported that the french and german interior ministers had complained " this week " about spain 's immigration policy , saying " 25,000 illegals from black africa have crossed the pyrenees in the past few months " to france , belgium and the netherlands . quoting police experts , abc said another 25,000 were still in spain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily the paper added that french interior minister nicolas sarkozy had called the spanish government the " sorcerer 's apprentice " in terms of immigration and called the country “ an open door ” while the paper quoted german counterpart otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- as saying that " massive -lrb- immigrant -rrb- regularization has the knock-on effect of attracting new illegals .

some subsidy backers say brussels is keeping them in the dark . first came the proposal to reduce agricultural subsidies ; then came the backlash . peter mandelson , the eu trade commissioner , called for reducing subsidies under the bloc 's common agricultural policy by 70 percent and farm import duties by 60 percent after 2013 . then france , along with a dozen other members , called an emergency meeting tuesday to tie his hands .
they accused him of exceeding his mandate , offering too many concessions in negotiations , and want him restricted before he goes to hong kong in december . france 's main farm union , fnsea , accused mandelson of " sacrificing european agriculture on the altar of economic and social deregulation , " saying thousands of jobs were threatened . not over yet mandelson has been pressuring member states to give him the negotiating power to allow him to reach a deal over farm subsidies , which he says would be to everyone 's benefit - both developing and industrial nations . trade experts say progress on cutting subsidies that developed nations pay to their farmers is crucial to agreeing on a global trade back at wto talks in hong kong in december , which could boost or hinder the world economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson wants his hands untied " the world trade talks are important for all of us , including many developing countries , " he told reporters .
" so it is very important that we are allowed to go forwards and not backwards . " eleven of the union 's 25 members , including britain , support easing subsidies and tariffs during wto negotiations . mandelson has said that his initiative to lower subsidies does not exceed his mandate and denies that he is british prime minister tony blair 's lackey .
blair and french president jacques chirac have fought frequently over eu farm subsidies , which total over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- a year and largely benefit the french . european farmers warn eu meanwhile , european farmers reiterated their demands tuesday that the european commission stay within its mandate , echoing the french government . jean-michel lemetayer , head of the french farmers ' group caf , said that the commission had to know " the limits not to go past , " particularly on the issue of opening up the european market to imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamy wants to see a deal addressing the meeting of 650 members of agriculture groups from across europe , the director-general of the wto , pascal lamy , tried to reassuring those present . " my conviction is that european farmers have no reason to be on the defensive , " lamy said .
" with these negotiations you have the opportunity to win a double dividend , " he said , because european farmers could benefit from agricultural reforms within the european union and from trade reforms by other members of the wto , which could give european manufacturers more access to fast-growing markets like brazil and india . lamy added that the united states had accepted the principle of reducing their agricultural subsidies and that the eu had to demonstrate " greater flexibility " in return .
the us has said europe needs to go further with agricultural subsidy reform . but anxieties within the farming community that the eu commission might go too far in reducing support for its farmers were backed by the president of the agricultural commission in the european parliament , joseph daul . daul said that he had " the painful feeling that the eu is capitulating at the wto .

some are not surprised . this year , germany ranked the 16th cleanest country out of 159 surveyed , according to transparency international 's corruption perception index 2005 , slipping from its 15th place finish last year .
some officials are attributing the slide to recent scandals and to a lack of government anti-corruption measures .
" the frequency of corruption cases that we have had to deal with in the past months has taken some people by surprise , but not us . "
peter von blomberg with transparency deutschland , the local arm of the organization , told german news agency dpa . he referred to recent corruption scandals such as the one plaguing germany 's stock exchange and added that instead of tackling corruption problems themselves , representatives of the business community have been fighting the publication of corruption studies such as this latest one . iceland is cleanest the corruption survey reports that serious levels of corruption exist in two thirds of the 159 countries examined , and that there was a clear link between poverty and corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty breeds corruption , transparency says the report found that chad , bangladesh , turkmenistan and myanmar were perceived as the most corrupt countries in the world , while iceland was the cleanest .
most of the countries that landed at the bottom of the list were in africa , while those which came in at the top were industrialized asian and western countries . the nations perceived as the most corrupt also rank among the world 's poorest , which shows how corruption and poverty feed off each other , according to the report . " corruption is a major cause of poverty as well as a barrier to overcoming it , " locking poor countries in " a cycle of misery , " said transparency international chairman peter eigen .
" corruption must be vigorously addressed if aid is to make a real difference in freeing people from poverty . " severe corruption problem despite progress on many fronts , including the soon-to-be-implemented united nations convention against corruption , 70 countries scored less than three on the cpi , indicating a severe corruption problem , the report said . the cpi index score relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business people and country analysts and ranges between 10 , which is highly clean and zero , which is highly corrupt . for example , the united states was ranked 17th with a score of 7.6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says countries must do more against corruption iceland topped the list with a score of 9.7 , followed by finland -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , new zealand -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , denmark -lrb- 9.5 -rrb- , singapore -lrb- 9.4 -rrb- , sweden -lrb- 9.2 -rrb- , switzerland -lrb- 9.1 -rrb- norway -lrb- 8.9 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 8.8 -rrb- and austria -lrb- 8.7 -rrb- . ahead of germany 's score of 8.2 were the netherlands , britain , luxembourg , canada and hong kong .
france , belgium and ireland came in at 18th , 19th and 20th , respectively .
italy ranked 40th .
new eu countries such as poland fared worse , coming in at 70th place .
bottom of the list was chad -lrb- 1.7 -rrb- , followed by bangladesh -lrb- 1.7 -rrb- , turkmenistan -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- , myanmar -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- and haiti -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fighting global corruption from germany twelve years after he founded it , peter eigen is stepping down as chief of transparency international .

the bundestag is expected to sit in mid-november to formally elect merkel as chancellor . " we must take this criticism seriously " the oldest member of the bundestag , interior minster otto schilly officially opened the session .
afterwards , norbert lammert , a christian democrat who has been a member of parliament for 25 years , was elected its new speaker , replacing social democrat wolfgang thierse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new speaker , nobert lammert -lrb- left -rrb- , with angela merkel " neither germany ’ s parties and parliament nor the government and opposition are currently highly regarded by the german public , " said lammert .
" we must take this criticism seriously , because the huge challenges our country is facing can only be tackled if germans regain trust in their political institutions . " merkel 's christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , have 226 seats in the lower house , just four more than schröder 's social democrats .
despite having given up his ambitions of serving a third term as chancellor , schröder retains a seat in the bundestag . attack on all fronts the rest of the parliament is made up by the free democrats with 61 seats , the 54 lawmakers of the left party - a mix of former communists and disgruntled social democrats - and the former governing coalition partners , the greens , who have 51 seats . germany ’ s new left party already vowed to attack the new government , especially on its social policies .
the party unites former east german communists with former leftwing spd members who were critical of gerhard schröder ’ s economic and welfare reforms , which they described as unfair to the poor .
the environmentalist greens are convinced that neither the government nor the two other opposition parties are sufficiently committed to environmentally sound policies . problems at home ? meanwhile , the german press on tuesday predicted problems ahead for merkel from her own camp following the nomination of seehofer to the agriculture ministry . known for his stance on the left wing of the conservatives , seehofer has clashed with merkel over her proposals to reform the health service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trouble from within - edmund stoiber and merkel have their differences edmund stoiber , the head of the csu and the new economy minister , insisted on seehofer 's nomination to government in exchange for his support .

the bundestag is expected to sit in mid-november to formally elect merkel as chancellor . " we must take this criticism seriously " the oldest member of the bundestag , interior minster otto schilly officially opened the session .
afterwards , norbert lammert , a christian democrat who has been a member of parliament for 25 years , was elected its new speaker , replacing social democrat wolfgang thierse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new speaker , nobert lammert -lrb- left -rrb- , with angela merkel " neither germany ’ s parties and parliament nor the government and opposition are currently highly regarded by the german public , " said lammert .
" we must take this criticism seriously , because the huge challenges our country is facing can only be tackled if germans regain trust in their political institutions . " merkel 's christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , have 226 seats in the lower house , just four more than schröder 's social democrats .
despite having given up his ambitions of serving a third term as chancellor , schröder retains a seat in the bundestag . attack on all fronts the rest of the parliament is made up by the free democrats with 61 seats , the 54 lawmakers of the left party - a mix of former communists and disgruntled social democrats - and the former governing coalition partners , the greens , who have 51 seats . germany ’ s new left party already vowed to attack the new government , especially on its social policies .
the party unites former east german communists with former leftwing spd members who were critical of gerhard schröder ’ s economic and welfare reforms , which they described as unfair to the poor .
the environmentalist greens are convinced that neither the government nor the two other opposition parties are sufficiently committed to environmentally sound policies . problems at home ? meanwhile , the german press on tuesday predicted problems ahead for merkel from her own camp following the nomination of seehofer to the agriculture ministry . known for his stance on the left wing of the conservatives , seehofer has clashed with merkel over her proposals to reform the health service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trouble from within - edmund stoiber and merkel have their differences edmund stoiber , the head of the csu and the new economy minister , insisted on seehofer 's nomination to government in exchange for his support . " stoiber could not have brought a stronger merkel opponent into the cabinet , " commented the left-wing tageszeitung daily . other newspapers said seehofer was likely to side with the eight social democrat ministers in the government in opposing large-scale reforms . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de federal reform : a critical first step now that angela merkel 's cabinet has been named , it 's time for the hard work to begin .
at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform .

" we are only talking about material damage , " kaczynski , who is warsaw 's present-day mayor , told reporters at a briefing . although kaczynski , who is trailing liberal candidate donald tusk in the race for the presidency , which goes to a second round on sunday , denied he was using the lingering animosity between poland and germany to try to win votes , political analyst stanislaw mocek read the opposite into his tactic .

" work on this report was begun in may 2004 ; it is not linked in any way whatsoever to the electoral calendar , " he told journalists , before recalling his suspicion of poland 's large neighbour to the west , germany , and stressing that poland " needs a president who speaks out decisively , not a president who is open to compromise , as the german press presents donald tusk . " the report , nearly 700 pages long and entitled " warsaw 's losses between 1939 and 1945 , " was commissioned in response to announcements that germans who were expelled from areas in western poland at the end of the war intended to seek compensation for property they had to leave behind . " if germany insists on rewriting history , if there are more demands for compensation ... we have a weapon to defend ourselves with this report , " kaczynski said . " there was no other city in occupied europe which lost more than half its inhabitants and was more than 80 percent destroyed , as was warsaw , " he said . " the germans can not be allowed to present themselves as the second victims of world war two after the jews . " strategy already used fanning the abiding distrust of germany has already been used in the election campaign . last week , kaczynski 's election team accused tusk 's grandfather of fighting in the german army in world war ii , an accusation tusk said " overstepped the bounds of decency " - and which cost kaczynski 's campaign chief jacek kurski his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi troops march into poland in 1939 world war two started with the german invasion of poland , and accusations of collaborating with the nazis during the war still hit home , more than half a century later . " kaczynski always puts himself forward as the only good guy , " said mocek . but neither his accusations about tusk 's grandfather being in the wehrmacht , nor the report on nazi destruction in warsaw , appeared to have done the conservative presidential candidate much good . five days before the second round , opinion polls put tusk in the lead with around 58 percent of the vote , with kaczynski about 15 points behind him . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , warsaw head for cool spell strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .

" korea is an unknown country in europe .
korean culture is overshadowed by japan and china , " said hwang chi-woo , the author acting as director of the guest of honour delegation . he said his aim was simply to get europeans to talk about his country 's writing and to understand its quiet understatement , which he compared to " the light that softens everything . " a divided country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea is the guest of honor for many of the visiting authors it is also a quest to inform the west of the political plight of the korean peninsula , which was cut in two along the 38th latitude in 1948 , and their longing for reunification with the communist north . " we are all homeless .
i am not from the north or the south , i have no identity apart from the korean language , " the country 's most-read author , hwang sok-yong , told the berlin-based daily newspaper der tagesspiegel . hwang , who spent five years in prison for an unauthorised visit to north korea to promote dialogue between artists from the two states , said the heavily-guarded border between korea 's two halves seemed like a hangover from an era the rest of the world is forgetting . " it all looks like a museum depicting the cold war - it looks like make-believe , " hwang said . lost without translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt book fair focused on arabic literature last year the lack of german translations of korean works has made for a two-year race against time to get some 100 titles ready for the book fair . according to the festival spokeswoman caroline vogel , it proved to be an impossible deadline . " it is very difficult because there are not enough translations and there are not enough translators .
it is literature and not everybody can translate literature , " vogel said . " but it is always like this .
last year it was the same problem for arab authors , and i think the koreans have managed almost 80 translations . " at a kiosk near you bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asterix is in lofty company at the world 's most important book fair asterix creator albert uderzo , on the other hand , does not have any problems getting his work translated . two and half million translations of the latest title in the legendary french comic strip series about two gauls ' adventures in the roman empire went on sale in germany on friday . the germans have a love affair with asterix rivalled only by the french , to the point at which some readers forget what nationality the heroes are .
the release in germany coincided with that in france . uderzo will put in at least three public appearances at frankfurt , vogel said , including a live internet chat with eight of his translators to which fans can " listen in . " the most exhibitors ever frankfurt remains the biggest book forum for english language publishers , surpassing even the london book fair .
this year will have the most exhibitors yet with 7,000 expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret atwood , a pioneer of canadian women 's writing publishers are bringing out feminist writer margaret atwood alongside top-selling english authors nick hornby and ken follet , as well as controversial turkish author ohran pamuk .
pamuk 's seventh novel , " snow , " which tells of a surreal homecoming amid a wave of suicides prompted by a ban on the muslim headscarf , has earned him comparisons with german modernist master franz kafka . also coming to the fair is the dutch poet , novelist and playwright cees nooteboom , who has frequently been mentioned as a candidate for the nobel literature prize . echoes from sweden this year , the world 's most prestigious literary award went to british playwright harold pinter , who is published in germany by rowohlt , the same publishing house that struck it lucky last year when austria 's elfriede jelinek won the nobel prize . some 240,000 copies of her novels and plays sold within days of the announcement of the swedish academy 's decision last year , which is why rowohlt is expected to prepare for a pinter rush in frankfurt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders ' latest film will be screened during the book fair if the book fair keeps growing , vogel said it is not because the book market itself is getting bigger , but because it is moving with the times and adding innovative categories to the event . this year will see an antique book fair and a new section on magazines , while german director wim wenders is coming for a screening of his latest film " do n't come knocking " in the cinema section . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de harold pinter wins nobel literature prize leading british playwright harold pinter won the 2005 nobel literature prize on thursday , the swedish academy announced .

things got worse when a criminal network was uncovered .
the scandal returns as the trial of those involved starts tuesday . it was the scandal that dulled the shine on germany ’ s successful campaign to host the 2006 world cup .
on tuesday , the specter of match-fixing and corruption in german soccer rears its ugly head once again when the disgraced bundesliga referee robert hoyzer and five others come to court to face fraud charges . hoyzer and his alleged cohorts are at the center of germany ’ s biggest sporting embarrassment ; a scandal involving crooked match officials , greedy and corrupt players and a network of gangsters which stretched from germany to turkey and beyond . the affair tells the story of games thrown for money , a widespread illegal betting cartel and the threats and intimidation that went with instigating a match-rigging operation which threatened to undermine the very structure of soccer in germany . trial likely to coincide with world cup draw tuesday 's opening session in berlin 's superior court will reopen wounds inflicted on the game that have barely had time to scab over .
and with the world cup due to kick off in less than nine months , german soccer authorities are hoping that the trial is concluded swiftly .
an on-going process dealing with the most sordid episode in the german game for 30 years would hardly be the best byline for the headlines trumpeting the start of germany ’ s moment in the global soccer sun . with full and partial confessions from all but one of the defendants , the trial is unlikely to still be going on by the time the first ball is kicked on june 8 , 2006 .
however , with sessions initially scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays and with lawyers in the case predicting anything from six to 12 sessions needed to conclude the case , it will almost certainly still be going on when the sport 's most powerful figures gather in leipzig before the draw for the world cup tournament on december 9 . disgraced referee hoyzer back in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer went underground after his release the trial will bring robert hoyzer back into the spotlight and will lay bare once more the details of the 26-year old ’ s involvement as a central figure in the scandal . the berlin-based former referee officiated at matches in the second division and lower leagues in the bundesliga but hit the headlines after it was revealed at the start of 2005 that he took a bribe to throw the result of the german cup first round game between top flight side hamburg sv and regional league side paderborn on august 21 , 2004 . hamburg had been leading 2-0 , but went on to lose 4-2 after hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg striker emile mpenza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei barbarez remonstrates with hoyzer in the notorious match as the investigation went on , it was revealed that hoyzer may have been involved with the fixing or attempted fixing of nine matches in total .
according to reports at the time , further investigation into hoyzer uncovered that he was paid bribes totaling 67,000 euros and was given a flat-screen television . he was arrested in february and spent two weeks in custody .
during his time in incarceration , hoyzer co-operated with berlin prosecutors and the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , who later banned him for life .
he faces 11 charges at trial , including complicity to defraud . official and shamed player face rigging charges as well as hoyer , referee dominik marks and former top flight player steffen karl are charged with involvement in the rigging of matches between april and december last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominik marks maintains his innocence marks has been accused of fixing two matches by hoyzer , one in the second division and the other in the regional northern league .
he was arrested in march 9 and spent four weeks in custody under suspicion of match-fixing .
despite maintaining his innocence , marks faces five charges . karl , a former defensive midfielder for borussia dortmund and hertha berlin , is accused of throwing games for financial gain and faces five charges . all three are accused of involvement under the orders of three croatian brothers who betted on the results .
it is thought that ante sapina , one of the brothers and the alleged gambling ringleader , made over 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.20 million -rrb- on two rigged matches alone . croatians at the heart of betting cartel # b # ante , at 27 the youngest of the three sapina brothers , faces 42 charges including the running of an illegal match-fixing operation .
the 40-year old eldest brother milan faces 11 charges of betting on rigged matches while 37-year old filip , who has apparently co-operated with investigators , faces four similar charges . the defendants will be required to enter a plea at the beginning of the trial with all – except marks – expected to plead guilty .
the offences could bring jail terms of up to 10 years , although lawyers from the defense counsel hope that the confessions and a lack of previous convictions will lead to sentences nearer the one year minimum . investigation uncovers widespread corruption in total , berlin prosecutors have investigated 25 people in connection with the scandal , many of whom are suspected of having been involved in manipulating at least 10 matches in 2004 .
there have also been 14 players investigated , from second division clubs energie cottbus , dynamo dresden and regional sides chemnitzer fc , kickers offenbach and sc paderborn . prosecutors have also seized 2.44 million euros in bank accounts and of assets belonging to the three sapina brothers during february raids . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a shadow over german soccer german soccer has struggled recently .

some are not surprised . this year , germany ranked the 16th cleanest country out of 159 surveyed , according to transparency international 's corruption perception index 2005 , slipping from its 15th place finish last year .
some officials are attributing the slide to recent scandals and to a lack of government anti-corruption measures .
" the frequency of corruption cases that we have had to deal with in the past months has taken some people by surprise , but not us . "
peter von blomberg with transparency deutschland , the local arm of the organization , told german news agency dpa . he referred to recent corruption scandals such as the one plaguing germany 's stock exchange and added that instead of tackling corruption problems themselves , representatives of the business community have been fighting the publication of corruption studies such as this latest one . iceland is cleanest the corruption survey reports that serious levels of corruption exist in two thirds of the 159 countries examined , and that there was a clear link between poverty and corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty breeds corruption , transparency says the report found that chad , bangladesh , turkmenistan and myanmar were perceived as the most corrupt countries in the world , while iceland was the cleanest .
most of the countries that landed at the bottom of the list were in africa , while those which came in at the top were industrialized asian and western countries . the nations perceived as the most corrupt also rank among the world 's poorest , which shows how corruption and poverty feed off each other , according to the report . " corruption is a major cause of poverty as well as a barrier to overcoming it , " locking poor countries in " a cycle of misery , " said transparency international chairman peter eigen .
" corruption must be vigorously addressed if aid is to make a real difference in freeing people from poverty . " severe corruption problem despite progress on many fronts , including the soon-to-be-implemented united nations convention against corruption , 70 countries scored less than three on the cpi , indicating a severe corruption problem , the report said . the cpi index score relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business people and country analysts and ranges between 10 , which is highly clean and zero , which is highly corrupt . for example , the united states was ranked 17th with a score of 7.6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says countries must do more against corruption iceland topped the list with a score of 9.7 , followed by finland -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , new zealand -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , denmark -lrb- 9.5 -rrb- , singapore -lrb- 9.4 -rrb- , sweden -lrb- 9.2 -rrb- , switzerland -lrb- 9.1 -rrb- norway -lrb- 8.9 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 8.8 -rrb- and austria -lrb- 8.7 -rrb- . ahead of germany 's score of 8.2 were the netherlands , britain , luxembourg , canada and hong kong .
france , belgium and ireland came in at 18th , 19th and 20th , respectively .
italy ranked 40th .
new eu countries such as poland fared worse , coming in at 70th place .
bottom of the list was chad -lrb- 1.7 -rrb- , followed by bangladesh -lrb- 1.7 -rrb- , turkmenistan -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- , myanmar -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- and haiti -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fighting global corruption from germany twelve years after he founded it , peter eigen is stepping down as chief of transparency international .

a controversial figure , schäuble returns to the position which he held under former chancellor helmut kohl . wolfgang schäuble is considered by many to be the most experienced member of chancellor-designate angela merkel 's new coalition government . schäuble , 63 , made his career in the ample shadow of former chancellor kohl when he was considered the chancellor 's closest confidant . merkel 's conservatives named the respected cdu veteran to head the interior ministry , a position he also held from 1989-1991 . schäubles rise to the top wolfgang schäuble is a protestant who was born in freiburg in 1942 . a trained lawyer by profession , he has served as an elected official for over 35 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble survived an assasination attempt by a mentally ill man in 1990 .
confined to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 that left him paralyzed him from the waist down , schäuble is considered one of the architects of german reunification . he served as interior minister in the kohl government and was chief whip of the cdu , building a reputation as a cross-party deal-maker in germany 's complex system of federal government .

finance scandal damages cdu just over a year after being voted out of office , helmut kohl admitted in a tv interview that the cdu had received approximately two million deutsche marks in secret donations between 1993 and 1998 .
these donations , which were not published in the party 's annual finance reports , were then funnelled back into the coffers of regional and local cdu party branches , to cover campaign costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble was considered by many to be helmut kohls right hand man when the allegations first emerged in 1999 , schäuble promised quick party-wide investigations and acted carefully to minimize political damage to his predecessor and one-time mentor . however by the beginning of 2000 it was clear that the cdu 's funding scandal engulf him as well . schäuble admitted on january 10 , 2000 , that he had received a cash donation of 100,000 dm from karlheinz schreiber , a bavarian businessman and arms dealer .

he suffered a setback in 2004 when merkel refused to back him for the role of federal president , preferring the cdu 's former head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , for the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble congratulates angela merkel in 1998 after she was elected as cdu general secretary relations between merkel and schäuble have improved over the years but he is not regarded as a close ally .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.10.2005 eu fights over agriculture subsidies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : save our farmers , cry the french two months before world trade organization talks on liberalizing trade , eu members are split over the issue of subsidies for farmers .
some subsidy backers say brussels is keeping them in the dark . first came the proposal to reduce agricultural subsidies ; then came the backlash . peter mandelson , the eu trade commissioner , called for reducing subsidies under the bloc 's common agricultural policy by 70 percent and farm import duties by 60 percent after 2013 . then france , along with a dozen other members , called an emergency meeting tuesday to tie his hands .
they accused him of exceeding his mandate , offering too many concessions in negotiations , and want him restricted before he goes to hong kong in december . france 's main farm union , fnsea , accused mandelson of " sacrificing european agriculture on the altar of economic and social deregulation , " saying thousands of jobs were threatened . not over yet mandelson has been pressuring member states to give him the negotiating power to allow him to reach a deal over farm subsidies , which he says would be to everyone 's benefit - both developing and industrial nations . trade experts say progress on cutting subsidies that developed nations pay to their farmers is crucial to agreeing on a global trade back at wto talks in hong kong in december , which could boost or hinder the world economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson wants his hands untied " the world trade talks are important for all of us , including many developing countries , " he told reporters .
" so it is very important that we are allowed to go forwards and not backwards . " eleven of the union 's 25 members , including britain , support easing subsidies and tariffs during wto negotiations . mandelson has said that his initiative to lower subsidies does not exceed his mandate and denies that he is british prime minister tony blair 's lackey .
blair and french president jacques chirac have fought frequently over eu farm subsidies , which total over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- a year and largely benefit the french . european farmers warn eu meanwhile , european farmers reiterated their demands tuesday that the european commission stay within its mandate , echoing the french government . jean-michel lemetayer , head of the french farmers ' group caf , said that the commission had to know " the limits not to go past , " particularly on the issue of opening up the european market to imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamy wants to see a deal addressing the meeting of 650 members of agriculture groups from across europe , the director-general of the wto , pascal lamy , tried to reassuring those present . " my conviction is that european farmers have no reason to be on the defensive , " lamy said .
" with these negotiations you have the opportunity to win a double dividend , " he said , because european farmers could benefit from agricultural reforms within the european union and from trade reforms by other members of the wto , which could give european manufacturers more access to fast-growing markets like brazil and india . lamy added that the united states had accepted the principle of reducing their agricultural subsidies and that the eu had to demonstrate " greater flexibility " in return .
the us has said europe needs to go further with agricultural subsidy reform . but anxieties within the farming community that the eu commission might go too far in reducing support for its farmers were backed by the president of the agricultural commission in the european parliament , joseph daul . daul said that he had " the painful feeling that the eu is capitulating at the wto .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.10.2005 federal reform : a critical first step großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rethinking federal and state responsibilities is critical now that angela merkel 's cabinet has been named , it 's time for the hard work to begin .
at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .
they want to know about the things that affect them directly .
which taxes will be raised or lowered ?
will their pensions rise or fall ?
will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?
will driving on the country 's freeways remain free of charge ? all of these questions will be addressed in the coming four weeks of coalition negotiations .
in this respect , the last month , while high drama for journalists , was wasted time in the eyes of most citizens . people are interested in results , even the kind of results that they suspect will be painful .
at the same time , that 's exactly what they are afraid of .
of course people know that five million unemployed will , over time , prove the ruin of the welfare state .
they 're aware that the public coffers are already in critical condition .
but they are very afraid of the actions that need to be taken to solve these problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans voted for reform , but not too much of it it is because the union parties prescribed bitter medicine to address germany 's ills during their election campaign that they did so poorly on election day .
and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .
the remaining tasks at hand could then be tackled by the next government , whatever its composition may be . felix steiner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .
-lrb- oct .
11 , 2005 -rrb- what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .

things got worse when a criminal network was uncovered .
the scandal returns as the trial of those involved starts tuesday . it was the scandal that dulled the shine on germany ’ s successful campaign to host the 2006 world cup .
on tuesday , the specter of match-fixing and corruption in german soccer rears its ugly head once again when the disgraced bundesliga referee robert hoyzer and five others come to court to face fraud charges . hoyzer and his alleged cohorts are at the center of germany ’ s biggest sporting embarrassment ; a scandal involving crooked match officials , greedy and corrupt players and a network of gangsters which stretched from germany to turkey and beyond . the affair tells the story of games thrown for money , a widespread illegal betting cartel and the threats and intimidation that went with instigating a match-rigging operation which threatened to undermine the very structure of soccer in germany . trial likely to coincide with world cup draw tuesday 's opening session in berlin 's superior court will reopen wounds inflicted on the game that have barely had time to scab over .
and with the world cup due to kick off in less than nine months , german soccer authorities are hoping that the trial is concluded swiftly .
an on-going process dealing with the most sordid episode in the german game for 30 years would hardly be the best byline for the headlines trumpeting the start of germany ’ s moment in the global soccer sun . with full and partial confessions from all but one of the defendants , the trial is unlikely to still be going on by the time the first ball is kicked on june 8 , 2006 .
however , with sessions initially scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays and with lawyers in the case predicting anything from six to 12 sessions needed to conclude the case , it will almost certainly still be going on when the sport 's most powerful figures gather in leipzig before the draw for the world cup tournament on december 9 . disgraced referee hoyzer back in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer went underground after his release the trial will bring robert hoyzer back into the spotlight and will lay bare once more the details of the 26-year old ’ s involvement as a central figure in the scandal . the berlin-based former referee officiated at matches in the second division and lower leagues in the bundesliga but hit the headlines after it was revealed at the start of 2005 that he took a bribe to throw the result of the german cup first round game between top flight side hamburg sv and regional league side paderborn on august 21 , 2004 . hamburg had been leading 2-0 , but went on to lose 4-2 after hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg striker emile mpenza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei barbarez remonstrates with hoyzer in the notorious match as the investigation went on , it was revealed that hoyzer may have been involved with the fixing or attempted fixing of nine matches in total .
according to reports at the time , further investigation into hoyzer uncovered that he was paid bribes totaling 67,000 euros and was given a flat-screen television . he was arrested in february and spent two weeks in custody .
during his time in incarceration , hoyzer co-operated with berlin prosecutors and the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , who later banned him for life .
he faces 11 charges at trial , including complicity to defraud . official and shamed player face rigging charges as well as hoyer , referee dominik marks and former top flight player steffen karl are charged with involvement in the rigging of matches between april and december last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominik marks maintains his innocence marks has been accused of fixing two matches by hoyzer , one in the second division and the other in the regional northern league .
he was arrested in march 9 and spent four weeks in custody under suspicion of match-fixing .
despite maintaining his innocence , marks faces five charges . karl , a former defensive midfielder for borussia dortmund and hertha berlin , is accused of throwing games for financial gain and faces five charges . all three are accused of involvement under the orders of three croatian brothers who betted on the results .
it is thought that ante sapina , one of the brothers and the alleged gambling ringleader , made over 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.20 million -rrb- on two rigged matches alone . croatians at the heart of betting cartel # b # ante , at 27 the youngest of the three sapina brothers , faces 42 charges including the running of an illegal match-fixing operation .
the 40-year old eldest brother milan faces 11 charges of betting on rigged matches while 37-year old filip , who has apparently co-operated with investigators , faces four similar charges . the defendants will be required to enter a plea at the beginning of the trial with all – except marks – expected to plead guilty .
the offences could bring jail terms of up to 10 years , although lawyers from the defense counsel hope that the confessions and a lack of previous convictions will lead to sentences nearer the one year minimum . investigation uncovers widespread corruption in total , berlin prosecutors have investigated 25 people in connection with the scandal , many of whom are suspected of having been involved in manipulating at least 10 matches in 2004 .
there have also been 14 players investigated , from second division clubs energie cottbus , dynamo dresden and regional sides chemnitzer fc , kickers offenbach and sc paderborn . prosecutors have also seized 2.44 million euros in bank accounts and of assets belonging to the three sapina brothers during february raids . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a shadow over german soccer german soccer has struggled recently .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.10.2005 federal reform : a critical first step großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rethinking federal and state responsibilities is critical now that angela merkel 's cabinet has been named , it 's time for the hard work to begin .
at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .
they want to know about the things that affect them directly .
which taxes will be raised or lowered ?
will their pensions rise or fall ?
will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?
will driving on the country 's freeways remain free of charge ? all of these questions will be addressed in the coming four weeks of coalition negotiations .
in this respect , the last month , while high drama for journalists , was wasted time in the eyes of most citizens . people are interested in results , even the kind of results that they suspect will be painful .
at the same time , that 's exactly what they are afraid of .
of course people know that five million unemployed will , over time , prove the ruin of the welfare state .
they 're aware that the public coffers are already in critical condition .
but they are very afraid of the actions that need to be taken to solve these problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans voted for reform , but not too much of it it is because the union parties prescribed bitter medicine to address germany 's ills during their election campaign that they did so poorly on election day .
and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .
the remaining tasks at hand could then be tackled by the next government , whatever its composition may be . felix steiner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.10.2005 spain , france join forces on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are prepared to go to any length to enter the eu spain and france have announced that they will propose a joint plan for a european-african conference on immigration at a european union summit later this month . the plan will be supported at the meeting by the french who gave their public backing to the proposal which will be presented at the summit in britain on oct .
27 and 28 . " france supports the spanish idea of a european-african conference on immigration , " french prime minister dominique de villepin said on monday after holding discussions with his spanish counterpart jose luis rodriguez zapatero in barcelona . " all of our countries are confronted today with this question of immigration .
we should treat it with courage , daring and imagination , " de villepin added . " spain and france will present a joint initiative at the next european council on a global plan on a response to immigration ... which commits the eu much more than it has been up to now , " prime minister zapatero told the press conference . the issue came to a head last month with a series of assaults by thousands of sub-saharan african immigrants on fencing at the spanish border surrounding the north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla - africa 's only land border with the eu . deaths and mayhem at spain 's african border at least 14 people have died in their attempt to leap over the heavily defended borders after trekking across vast swathes of africa to northern morocco .
some of them have been shot by moroccan security forces while desperately attempting to reach a better life in europe . bildunterschrift : african immigrants in a transit camp near spain after struggling for some time to keep the waves of immigrants from swamping its borders , spain has repeatedly called on the eu to get a grip on the roots of the illegal immigration problem by aiding the poor african countries from where migrants originate .
the reasoning behind this policy being that if better opportunities existed at home , there would be less reason for migrants to risk their lives in attempting to reach the wealthy eu . zapatero told his french counterpart that illegal immigration from sub-saharan africa was an issue that concerned the whole of africa and europe and one that morocco and spain could not deal with alone . zapatero calls on eu to avert " humanitarian drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero spoke to chirac about the immigration issue .
" europe refuses to take the african immigrants , but spain and morocco can not play the role of eu policeman on their own , " a spanish spokesman told afp on behalf of the prime minister , adding it was " time to act " to solve a " humanitarian drama . "
zapatero himself revealed that he had spoken directly by phone with french president jacques chirac about the issue . as well as storming the borders around ceuta and melilla , thousands more african migrants take to rickety boats each year in a perilous trip to the canary islands or across the gibraltar strait to southern spain .
many don ’ t make it across alive . french pm sketches out two-pronged strategy while zapatero provided no details of the proposal , de villepin hinted at a two-pronged strategy which would combine improving controls along the border regions with a development and training program in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin .
the french prime minister added that transit countries for immigrants should also be given support in protecting their borders under a new , broad european immigration policy . spain annoyed some of its eu partners earlier this year by giving documentation to hundreds of thousands of immigrants who had been working illegally in spain and then had irritated them further recently by allowing “ thousands ” more to enter spain .. neighbors " irritated " by spanish policy the spanish daily abc reported that the french and german interior ministers had complained " this week " about spain 's immigration policy , saying " 25,000 illegals from black africa have crossed the pyrenees in the past few months " to france , belgium and the netherlands . quoting police experts , abc said another 25,000 were still in spain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily the paper added that french interior minister nicolas sarkozy had called the spanish government the " sorcerer 's apprentice " in terms of immigration and called the country “ an open door ” while the paper quoted german counterpart otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- as saying that " massive -lrb- immigrant -rrb- regularization has the knock-on effect of attracting new illegals .

" we are only talking about material damage , " kaczynski , who is warsaw 's present-day mayor , told reporters at a briefing . although kaczynski , who is trailing liberal candidate donald tusk in the race for the presidency , which goes to a second round on sunday , denied he was using the lingering animosity between poland and germany to try to win votes , political analyst stanislaw mocek read the opposite into his tactic . " it is surely no fluke that he presented this report today .
it is clearly a new element of his campaign , " said mocek of the polish academy of sciences . " kaczynski is trying to win over older voters who still vividly remember the war .
to the young , the past does n't mean much , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk , presidential candidate from the civic platform party " he is also trying to win votes in the west of the country , in regions that were german before the war , " said mocek .
tusk scored a clear win in the west in the first round of the vote . " not linked in any way " but kaczynski insisted the report was not tied to the election . " work on this report was begun in may 2004 ; it is not linked in any way whatsoever to the electoral calendar , " he told journalists , before recalling his suspicion of poland 's large neighbour to the west , germany , and stressing that poland " needs a president who speaks out decisively , not a president who is open to compromise , as the german press presents donald tusk . " the report , nearly 700 pages long and entitled " warsaw 's losses between 1939 and 1945 , " was commissioned in response to announcements that germans who were expelled from areas in western poland at the end of the war intended to seek compensation for property they had to leave behind . " if germany insists on rewriting history , if there are more demands for compensation ... we have a weapon to defend ourselves with this report , " kaczynski said . " there was no other city in occupied europe which lost more than half its inhabitants and was more than 80 percent destroyed , as was warsaw , " he said . " the germans can not be allowed to present themselves as the second victims of world war two after the jews . " strategy already used fanning the abiding distrust of germany has already been used in the election campaign . last week , kaczynski 's election team accused tusk 's grandfather of fighting in the german army in world war ii , an accusation tusk said " overstepped the bounds of decency " - and which cost kaczynski 's campaign chief jacek kurski his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi troops march into poland in 1939 world war two started with the german invasion of poland , and accusations of collaborating with the nazis during the war still hit home , more than half a century later . " kaczynski always puts himself forward as the only good guy , " said mocek . but neither his accusations about tusk 's grandfather being in the wehrmacht , nor the report on nazi destruction in warsaw , appeared to have done the conservative presidential candidate much good . five days before the second round , opinion polls put tusk in the lead with around 58 percent of the vote , with kaczynski about 15 points behind him . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , warsaw head for cool spell strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .

some are not surprised . this year , germany ranked the 16th cleanest country out of 159 surveyed , according to transparency international 's corruption perception index 2005 , slipping from its 15th place finish last year .
some officials are attributing the slide to recent scandals and to a lack of government anti-corruption measures .
" the frequency of corruption cases that we have had to deal with in the past months has taken some people by surprise , but not us . "
peter von blomberg with transparency deutschland , the local arm of the organization , told german news agency dpa . he referred to recent corruption scandals such as the one plaguing germany 's stock exchange and added that instead of tackling corruption problems themselves , representatives of the business community have been fighting the publication of corruption studies such as this latest one . iceland is cleanest the corruption survey reports that serious levels of corruption exist in two thirds of the 159 countries examined , and that there was a clear link between poverty and corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty breeds corruption , transparency says the report found that chad , bangladesh , turkmenistan and myanmar were perceived as the most corrupt countries in the world , while iceland was the cleanest .
most of the countries that landed at the bottom of the list were in africa , while those which came in at the top were industrialized asian and western countries . the nations perceived as the most corrupt also rank among the world 's poorest , which shows how corruption and poverty feed off each other , according to the report . " corruption is a major cause of poverty as well as a barrier to overcoming it , " locking poor countries in " a cycle of misery , " said transparency international chairman peter eigen .
" corruption must be vigorously addressed if aid is to make a real difference in freeing people from poverty . " severe corruption problem despite progress on many fronts , including the soon-to-be-implemented united nations convention against corruption , 70 countries scored less than three on the cpi , indicating a severe corruption problem , the report said . the cpi index score relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business people and country analysts and ranges between 10 , which is highly clean and zero , which is highly corrupt . for example , the united states was ranked 17th with a score of 7.6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says countries must do more against corruption iceland topped the list with a score of 9.7 , followed by finland -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , new zealand -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , denmark -lrb- 9.5 -rrb- , singapore -lrb- 9.4 -rrb- , sweden -lrb- 9.2 -rrb- , switzerland -lrb- 9.1 -rrb- norway -lrb- 8.9 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 8.8 -rrb- and austria -lrb- 8.7 -rrb- . ahead of germany 's score of 8.2 were the netherlands , britain , luxembourg , canada and hong kong .
france , belgium and ireland came in at 18th , 19th and 20th , respectively .
italy ranked 40th .
new eu countries such as poland fared worse , coming in at 70th place .

the infected turkey came from a small private poultry farm on the tiny island , and the authorities there have confirmed that they will cull all the other birds and medically examine the farmer 's family . the european union commission responded to the latest discovery by saying it would ban the export of live birds and bird related products from the chios area .
and the island 's prefect , polidoras lambrinoudis told the reuters news agency that no poultry or eggs were now allowed to leave the island . " risk to human health is conceivable , but minimal " so far , there have been no human cases of bird flu reported in europe , but the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has warned european nations not to divert funding and attention away from asia , which is the most likely breeding ground for the mutation of the virus into a form which is easily transmitted between humans . peter cordingly of the who says there is a lot of anxiety in europe which could mean that " governments might focus on domestic preparedness and forget the fact that ground zero is southeast asia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of birds have been culled in southeast asia health experts say that the fight against bird flu is being hampered by huge differences in wealth between nations .
some countries have poor public health infrastructures and no stockpiles of the expensive anti-viral drugs which could help to limit a human pandemic . millions of birds in the region have already been culled in an attempt to stop the spread of the h5n1 strain , which first emerged in hong kong in 1997 . europe is keen to strike a balance between testing for outbreaks of the deadly bird flu and the need to play down the threat to the public . " the risk to human health , to public health , is minimal , " zsuzanna jakab , the director of the european centre for disease prevention and control -lrb- ecdc -rrb- told a news conference .
" it is conceivable , but minimal . " but who influenza program director klaus stoehr warns of the devastating consequences if the disease is not contained . " we do n't know whether a pandemic will break out in the coming weeks , months , or only in years .
but there 's no question that if such a pandemic occurs we 'll be looking at hundreds of thousands or even millions of deaths worldwide , " he said . chicken is off the menu consumers across europe are responding to the westward spread of bird flu by turning away from chicken and other poultry .
reassurances that cooking chicken at temperatures above 160 degrees fahrenheit destroys the virus have done little to allay fears , with farmers and supermarkets across much of the continent reporting a drop in sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers in southern europe are reportedly off poultry farmers in turkey say that poultry sales have fallen by 50 percent , and several restaurants have already removed white meat from their menus .
even france has reported a ten percent slíde in poultry deliveries , and one supermarket chain , systeme u , said sales had slumped by as much as 30 percent over the past few days . the trend was echoed in switzerland , italy and hungary , which shares a border with romania where cases of the deadly disease were discovered earlier this month . by contrast consumers in a number of northern european countries , including britain and denmark have not started to rethink their menus , and farming representatives in both belgium and the netherlands say there has been no noticeable change in poultry consumption . the german federation for the poultry industry , which represents 8,000 farms , stressed that german consumers had not lost their appetite for white meat . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time .

some subsidy backers say brussels is keeping them in the dark . first came the proposal to reduce agricultural subsidies ; then came the backlash . peter mandelson , the eu trade commissioner , called for reducing subsidies under the bloc 's common agricultural policy by 70 percent and farm import duties by 60 percent after 2013 . then france , along with a dozen other members , called an emergency meeting tuesday to tie his hands .
they accused him of exceeding his mandate , offering too many concessions in negotiations , and want him restricted before he goes to hong kong in december . france 's main farm union , fnsea , accused mandelson of " sacrificing european agriculture on the altar of economic and social deregulation , " saying thousands of jobs were threatened . not over yet mandelson has been pressuring member states to give him the negotiating power to allow him to reach a deal over farm subsidies , which he says would be to everyone 's benefit - both developing and industrial nations . trade experts say progress on cutting subsidies that developed nations pay to their farmers is crucial to agreeing on a global trade back at wto talks in hong kong in december , which could boost or hinder the world economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson wants his hands untied " the world trade talks are important for all of us , including many developing countries , " he told reporters .
" so it is very important that we are allowed to go forwards and not backwards . " eleven of the union 's 25 members , including britain , support easing subsidies and tariffs during wto negotiations . mandelson has said that his initiative to lower subsidies does not exceed his mandate and denies that he is british prime minister tony blair 's lackey .
blair and french president jacques chirac have fought frequently over eu farm subsidies , which total over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- a year and largely benefit the french . european farmers warn eu meanwhile , european farmers reiterated their demands tuesday that the european commission stay within its mandate , echoing the french government . jean-michel lemetayer , head of the french farmers ' group caf , said that the commission had to know " the limits not to go past , " particularly on the issue of opening up the european market to imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamy wants to see a deal addressing the meeting of 650 members of agriculture groups from across europe , the director-general of the wto , pascal lamy , tried to reassuring those present . " my conviction is that european farmers have no reason to be on the defensive , " lamy said .
" with these negotiations you have the opportunity to win a double dividend , " he said , because european farmers could benefit from agricultural reforms within the european union and from trade reforms by other members of the wto , which could give european manufacturers more access to fast-growing markets like brazil and india . lamy added that the united states had accepted the principle of reducing their agricultural subsidies and that the eu had to demonstrate " greater flexibility " in return .

things got worse when a criminal network was uncovered .
the scandal returns as the trial of those involved starts tuesday . it was the scandal that dulled the shine on germany ’ s successful campaign to host the 2006 world cup .
on tuesday , the specter of match-fixing and corruption in german soccer rears its ugly head once again when the disgraced bundesliga referee robert hoyzer and five others come to court to face fraud charges . hoyzer and his alleged cohorts are at the center of germany ’ s biggest sporting embarrassment ; a scandal involving crooked match officials , greedy and corrupt players and a network of gangsters which stretched from germany to turkey and beyond . the affair tells the story of games thrown for money , a widespread illegal betting cartel and the threats and intimidation that went with instigating a match-rigging operation which threatened to undermine the very structure of soccer in germany . trial likely to coincide with world cup draw tuesday 's opening session in berlin 's superior court will reopen wounds inflicted on the game that have barely had time to scab over .
and with the world cup due to kick off in less than nine months , german soccer authorities are hoping that the trial is concluded swiftly .
an on-going process dealing with the most sordid episode in the german game for 30 years would hardly be the best byline for the headlines trumpeting the start of germany ’ s moment in the global soccer sun . with full and partial confessions from all but one of the defendants , the trial is unlikely to still be going on by the time the first ball is kicked on june 8 , 2006 .
however , with sessions initially scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays and with lawyers in the case predicting anything from six to 12 sessions needed to conclude the case , it will almost certainly still be going on when the sport 's most powerful figures gather in leipzig before the draw for the world cup tournament on december 9 . disgraced referee hoyzer back in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer went underground after his release the trial will bring robert hoyzer back into the spotlight and will lay bare once more the details of the 26-year old ’ s involvement as a central figure in the scandal . the berlin-based former referee officiated at matches in the second division and lower leagues in the bundesliga but hit the headlines after it was revealed at the start of 2005 that he took a bribe to throw the result of the german cup first round game between top flight side hamburg sv and regional league side paderborn on august 21 , 2004 . hamburg had been leading 2-0 , but went on to lose 4-2 after hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg striker emile mpenza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei barbarez remonstrates with hoyzer in the notorious match as the investigation went on , it was revealed that hoyzer may have been involved with the fixing or attempted fixing of nine matches in total .
according to reports at the time , further investigation into hoyzer uncovered that he was paid bribes totaling 67,000 euros and was given a flat-screen television . he was arrested in february and spent two weeks in custody .
during his time in incarceration , hoyzer co-operated with berlin prosecutors and the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , who later banned him for life .
he faces 11 charges at trial , including complicity to defraud . official and shamed player face rigging charges as well as hoyer , referee dominik marks and former top flight player steffen karl are charged with involvement in the rigging of matches between april and december last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominik marks maintains his innocence marks has been accused of fixing two matches by hoyzer , one in the second division and the other in the regional northern league .
he was arrested in march 9 and spent four weeks in custody under suspicion of match-fixing .
despite maintaining his innocence , marks faces five charges . karl , a former defensive midfielder for borussia dortmund and hertha berlin , is accused of throwing games for financial gain and faces five charges . all three are accused of involvement under the orders of three croatian brothers who betted on the results .
it is thought that ante sapina , one of the brothers and the alleged gambling ringleader , made over 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.20 million -rrb- on two rigged matches alone . croatians at the heart of betting cartel # b # ante , at 27 the youngest of the three sapina brothers , faces 42 charges including the running of an illegal match-fixing operation .
the 40-year old eldest brother milan faces 11 charges of betting on rigged matches while 37-year old filip , who has apparently co-operated with investigators , faces four similar charges . the defendants will be required to enter a plea at the beginning of the trial with all – except marks – expected to plead guilty .
the offences could bring jail terms of up to 10 years , although lawyers from the defense counsel hope that the confessions and a lack of previous convictions will lead to sentences nearer the one year minimum . investigation uncovers widespread corruption in total , berlin prosecutors have investigated 25 people in connection with the scandal , many of whom are suspected of having been involved in manipulating at least 10 matches in 2004 .
there have also been 14 players investigated , from second division clubs energie cottbus , dynamo dresden and regional sides chemnitzer fc , kickers offenbach and sc paderborn . prosecutors have also seized 2.44 million euros in bank accounts and of assets belonging to the three sapina brothers during february raids . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a shadow over german soccer german soccer has struggled recently .

27 and 28 . " france supports the spanish idea of a european-african conference on immigration , " french prime minister dominique de villepin said on monday after holding discussions with his spanish counterpart jose luis rodriguez zapatero in barcelona . " all of our countries are confronted today with this question of immigration .
we should treat it with courage , daring and imagination , " de villepin added . " spain and france will present a joint initiative at the next european council on a global plan on a response to immigration ... which commits the eu much more than it has been up to now , " prime minister zapatero told the press conference . the issue came to a head last month with a series of assaults by thousands of sub-saharan african immigrants on fencing at the spanish border surrounding the north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla - africa 's only land border with the eu . deaths and mayhem at spain 's african border at least 14 people have died in their attempt to leap over the heavily defended borders after trekking across vast swathes of africa to northern morocco .
some of them have been shot by moroccan security forces while desperately attempting to reach a better life in europe . bildunterschrift : african immigrants in a transit camp near spain after struggling for some time to keep the waves of immigrants from swamping its borders , spain has repeatedly called on the eu to get a grip on the roots of the illegal immigration problem by aiding the poor african countries from where migrants originate .
the reasoning behind this policy being that if better opportunities existed at home , there would be less reason for migrants to risk their lives in attempting to reach the wealthy eu . zapatero told his french counterpart that illegal immigration from sub-saharan africa was an issue that concerned the whole of africa and europe and one that morocco and spain could not deal with alone . zapatero calls on eu to avert " humanitarian drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero spoke to chirac about the immigration issue .
" europe refuses to take the african immigrants , but spain and morocco can not play the role of eu policeman on their own , " a spanish spokesman told afp on behalf of the prime minister , adding it was " time to act " to solve a " humanitarian drama . "
zapatero himself revealed that he had spoken directly by phone with french president jacques chirac about the issue . as well as storming the borders around ceuta and melilla , thousands more african migrants take to rickety boats each year in a perilous trip to the canary islands or across the gibraltar strait to southern spain .
many don ’ t make it across alive . french pm sketches out two-pronged strategy while zapatero provided no details of the proposal , de villepin hinted at a two-pronged strategy which would combine improving controls along the border regions with a development and training program in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin .
the french prime minister added that transit countries for immigrants should also be given support in protecting their borders under a new , broad european immigration policy . spain annoyed some of its eu partners earlier this year by giving documentation to hundreds of thousands of immigrants who had been working illegally in spain and then had irritated them further recently by allowing “ thousands ” more to enter spain .. neighbors " irritated " by spanish policy the spanish daily abc reported that the french and german interior ministers had complained " this week " about spain 's immigration policy , saying " 25,000 illegals from black africa have crossed the pyrenees in the past few months " to france , belgium and the netherlands . quoting police experts , abc said another 25,000 were still in spain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily the paper added that french interior minister nicolas sarkozy had called the spanish government the " sorcerer 's apprentice " in terms of immigration and called the country “ an open door ” while the paper quoted german counterpart otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- as saying that " massive -lrb- immigrant -rrb- regularization has the knock-on effect of attracting new illegals .

fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds europe -pipe- 18.10.2005 bird flu confirmed in greece , fears mount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the risk of infected poultry is rising in europe concerns over the spread of bird flu in europe continued to grow after a related form of the h5n1 virus was discovered in greece as consumers across europe begin losing their appetite for chicken . the greek agriculture ministry said it had detected the h5 strain of the virus - of which the deadly h5n1 is a member - on the aegean islet of inoussess off the island of chios , just a few miles from turkey , which has also confirmed cases of bird flu . the greek authorities , which took nine samples from poultry on the islet last week found the presence of the h5 strain in a turkey , but have not yet confirmed whether it is the deadly strain . agriculture minister evangelos bassiakos said experts would need " seven or eight days " to carry out further tests to establish exactly what they are dealing with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is taking the threat of the virus seriously if confirmed as the h5n1 strain , which has already claimed 60 lives in asia , it would be the first case in the european union .
the infected turkey came from a small private poultry farm on the tiny island , and the authorities there have confirmed that they will cull all the other birds and medically examine the farmer 's family . the european union commission responded to the latest discovery by saying it would ban the export of live birds and bird related products from the chios area .
and the island 's prefect , polidoras lambrinoudis told the reuters news agency that no poultry or eggs were now allowed to leave the island . " risk to human health is conceivable , but minimal " so far , there have been no human cases of bird flu reported in europe , but the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has warned european nations not to divert funding and attention away from asia , which is the most likely breeding ground for the mutation of the virus into a form which is easily transmitted between humans . peter cordingly of the who says there is a lot of anxiety in europe which could mean that " governments might focus on domestic preparedness and forget the fact that ground zero is southeast asia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of birds have been culled in southeast asia health experts say that the fight against bird flu is being hampered by huge differences in wealth between nations .
some countries have poor public health infrastructures and no stockpiles of the expensive anti-viral drugs which could help to limit a human pandemic . millions of birds in the region have already been culled in an attempt to stop the spread of the h5n1 strain , which first emerged in hong kong in 1997 . europe is keen to strike a balance between testing for outbreaks of the deadly bird flu and the need to play down the threat to the public . " the risk to human health , to public health , is minimal , " zsuzanna jakab , the director of the european centre for disease prevention and control -lrb- ecdc -rrb- told a news conference .
" it is conceivable , but minimal . " but who influenza program director klaus stoehr warns of the devastating consequences if the disease is not contained . " we do n't know whether a pandemic will break out in the coming weeks , months , or only in years .
but there 's no question that if such a pandemic occurs we 'll be looking at hundreds of thousands or even millions of deaths worldwide , " he said . chicken is off the menu consumers across europe are responding to the westward spread of bird flu by turning away from chicken and other poultry .
reassurances that cooking chicken at temperatures above 160 degrees fahrenheit destroys the virus have done little to allay fears , with farmers and supermarkets across much of the continent reporting a drop in sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers in southern europe are reportedly off poultry farmers in turkey say that poultry sales have fallen by 50 percent , and several restaurants have already removed white meat from their menus .
even france has reported a ten percent slíde in poultry deliveries , and one supermarket chain , systeme u , said sales had slumped by as much as 30 percent over the past few days . the trend was echoed in switzerland , italy and hungary , which shares a border with romania where cases of the deadly disease were discovered earlier this month . by contrast consumers in a number of northern european countries , including britain and denmark have not started to rethink their menus , and farming representatives in both belgium and the netherlands say there has been no noticeable change in poultry consumption . the german federation for the poultry industry , which represents 8,000 farms , stressed that german consumers had not lost their appetite for white meat . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.10.2005 federal reform : a critical first step großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rethinking federal and state responsibilities is critical now that angela merkel 's cabinet has been named , it 's time for the hard work to begin .
at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .
they want to know about the things that affect them directly .
which taxes will be raised or lowered ?
will their pensions rise or fall ?
will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?
will driving on the country 's freeways remain free of charge ? all of these questions will be addressed in the coming four weeks of coalition negotiations .
in this respect , the last month , while high drama for journalists , was wasted time in the eyes of most citizens . people are interested in results , even the kind of results that they suspect will be painful .
at the same time , that 's exactly what they are afraid of .
of course people know that five million unemployed will , over time , prove the ruin of the welfare state .
they 're aware that the public coffers are already in critical condition .
but they are very afraid of the actions that need to be taken to solve these problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans voted for reform , but not too much of it it is because the union parties prescribed bitter medicine to address germany 's ills during their election campaign that they did so poorly on election day .
and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .
the remaining tasks at hand could then be tackled by the next government , whatever its composition may be . felix steiner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .
-lrb- oct .
11 , 2005 -rrb- what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .
but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question .

at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .

will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?

in this respect , the last month , while high drama for journalists , was wasted time in the eyes of most citizens . people are interested in results , even the kind of results that they suspect will be painful .
at the same time , that 's exactly what they are afraid of .

and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .

things got worse when a criminal network was uncovered .
the scandal returns as the trial of those involved starts tuesday . it was the scandal that dulled the shine on germany ’ s successful campaign to host the 2006 world cup .
on tuesday , the specter of match-fixing and corruption in german soccer rears its ugly head once again when the disgraced bundesliga referee robert hoyzer and five others come to court to face fraud charges . hoyzer and his alleged cohorts are at the center of germany ’ s biggest sporting embarrassment ; a scandal involving crooked match officials , greedy and corrupt players and a network of gangsters which stretched from germany to turkey and beyond . the affair tells the story of games thrown for money , a widespread illegal betting cartel and the threats and intimidation that went with instigating a match-rigging operation which threatened to undermine the very structure of soccer in germany . trial likely to coincide with world cup draw tuesday 's opening session in berlin 's superior court will reopen wounds inflicted on the game that have barely had time to scab over .
and with the world cup due to kick off in less than nine months , german soccer authorities are hoping that the trial is concluded swiftly .
an on-going process dealing with the most sordid episode in the german game for 30 years would hardly be the best byline for the headlines trumpeting the start of germany ’ s moment in the global soccer sun . with full and partial confessions from all but one of the defendants , the trial is unlikely to still be going on by the time the first ball is kicked on june 8 , 2006 .
however , with sessions initially scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays and with lawyers in the case predicting anything from six to 12 sessions needed to conclude the case , it will almost certainly still be going on when the sport 's most powerful figures gather in leipzig before the draw for the world cup tournament on december 9 . disgraced referee hoyzer back in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer went underground after his release the trial will bring robert hoyzer back into the spotlight and will lay bare once more the details of the 26-year old ’ s involvement as a central figure in the scandal . the berlin-based former referee officiated at matches in the second division and lower leagues in the bundesliga but hit the headlines after it was revealed at the start of 2005 that he took a bribe to throw the result of the german cup first round game between top flight side hamburg sv and regional league side paderborn on august 21 , 2004 . hamburg had been leading 2-0 , but went on to lose 4-2 after hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg striker emile mpenza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei barbarez remonstrates with hoyzer in the notorious match as the investigation went on , it was revealed that hoyzer may have been involved with the fixing or attempted fixing of nine matches in total .

things got worse when a criminal network was uncovered .
the scandal returns as the trial of those involved starts tuesday . it was the scandal that dulled the shine on germany ’ s successful campaign to host the 2006 world cup .
on tuesday , the specter of match-fixing and corruption in german soccer rears its ugly head once again when the disgraced bundesliga referee robert hoyzer and five others come to court to face fraud charges . hoyzer and his alleged cohorts are at the center of germany ’ s biggest sporting embarrassment ; a scandal involving crooked match officials , greedy and corrupt players and a network of gangsters which stretched from germany to turkey and beyond . the affair tells the story of games thrown for money , a widespread illegal betting cartel and the threats and intimidation that went with instigating a match-rigging operation which threatened to undermine the very structure of soccer in germany . trial likely to coincide with world cup draw tuesday 's opening session in berlin 's superior court will reopen wounds inflicted on the game that have barely had time to scab over .
and with the world cup due to kick off in less than nine months , german soccer authorities are hoping that the trial is concluded swiftly .

the bundestag is expected to sit in mid-november to formally elect merkel as chancellor . " we must take this criticism seriously " the oldest member of the bundestag , interior minster otto schilly officially opened the session .
afterwards , norbert lammert , a christian democrat who has been a member of parliament for 25 years , was elected its new speaker , replacing social democrat wolfgang thierse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new speaker , nobert lammert -lrb- left -rrb- , with angela merkel " neither germany ’ s parties and parliament nor the government and opposition are currently highly regarded by the german public , " said lammert .
" we must take this criticism seriously , because the huge challenges our country is facing can only be tackled if germans regain trust in their political institutions . " merkel 's christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , have 226 seats in the lower house , just four more than schröder 's social democrats .
despite having given up his ambitions of serving a third term as chancellor , schröder retains a seat in the bundestag . attack on all fronts the rest of the parliament is made up by the free democrats with 61 seats , the 54 lawmakers of the left party - a mix of former communists and disgruntled social democrats - and the former governing coalition partners , the greens , who have 51 seats . germany ’ s new left party already vowed to attack the new government , especially on its social policies .
the party unites former east german communists with former leftwing spd members who were critical of gerhard schröder ’ s economic and welfare reforms , which they described as unfair to the poor .
the environmentalist greens are convinced that neither the government nor the two other opposition parties are sufficiently committed to environmentally sound policies . problems at home ? meanwhile , the german press on tuesday predicted problems ahead for merkel from her own camp following the nomination of seehofer to the agriculture ministry . known for his stance on the left wing of the conservatives , seehofer has clashed with merkel over her proposals to reform the health service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trouble from within - edmund stoiber and merkel have their differences edmund stoiber , the head of the csu and the new economy minister , insisted on seehofer 's nomination to government in exchange for his support . " stoiber could not have brought a stronger merkel opponent into the cabinet , " commented the left-wing tageszeitung daily . other newspapers said seehofer was likely to side with the eight social democrat ministers in the government in opposing large-scale reforms . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de federal reform : a critical first step now that angela merkel 's cabinet has been named , it 's time for the hard work to begin .

the infected turkey came from a small private poultry farm on the tiny island , and the authorities there have confirmed that they will cull all the other birds and medically examine the farmer 's family . the european union commission responded to the latest discovery by saying it would ban the export of live birds and bird related products from the chios area .

some countries have poor public health infrastructures and no stockpiles of the expensive anti-viral drugs which could help to limit a human pandemic . millions of birds in the region have already been culled in an attempt to stop the spread of the h5n1 strain , which first emerged in hong kong in 1997 . europe is keen to strike a balance between testing for outbreaks of the deadly bird flu and the need to play down the threat to the public .

" it is conceivable , but minimal . " but who influenza program director klaus stoehr warns of the devastating consequences if the disease is not contained . " we do n't know whether a pandemic will break out in the coming weeks , months , or only in years .
but there 's no question that if such a pandemic occurs we 'll be looking at hundreds of thousands or even millions of deaths worldwide , " he said . chicken is off the menu consumers across europe are responding to the westward spread of bird flu by turning away from chicken and other poultry .
reassurances that cooking chicken at temperatures above 160 degrees fahrenheit destroys the virus have done little to allay fears , with farmers and supermarkets across much of the continent reporting a drop in sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers in southern europe are reportedly off poultry farmers in turkey say that poultry sales have fallen by 50 percent , and several restaurants have already removed white meat from their menus .

" korea is an unknown country in europe .
korean culture is overshadowed by japan and china , " said hwang chi-woo , the author acting as director of the guest of honour delegation . he said his aim was simply to get europeans to talk about his country 's writing and to understand its quiet understatement , which he compared to " the light that softens everything . " a divided country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea is the guest of honor for many of the visiting authors it is also a quest to inform the west of the political plight of the korean peninsula , which was cut in two along the 38th latitude in 1948 , and their longing for reunification with the communist north . " we are all homeless .
i am not from the north or the south , i have no identity apart from the korean language , " the country 's most-read author , hwang sok-yong , told the berlin-based daily newspaper der tagesspiegel . hwang , who spent five years in prison for an unauthorised visit to north korea to promote dialogue between artists from the two states , said the heavily-guarded border between korea 's two halves seemed like a hangover from an era the rest of the world is forgetting . " it all looks like a museum depicting the cold war - it looks like make-believe , " hwang said . lost without translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt book fair focused on arabic literature last year the lack of german translations of korean works has made for a two-year race against time to get some 100 titles ready for the book fair . according to the festival spokeswoman caroline vogel , it proved to be an impossible deadline . " it is very difficult because there are not enough translations and there are not enough translators .
it is literature and not everybody can translate literature , " vogel said . " but it is always like this .
last year it was the same problem for arab authors , and i think the koreans have managed almost 80 translations . " at a kiosk near you bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asterix is in lofty company at the world 's most important book fair asterix creator albert uderzo , on the other hand , does not have any problems getting his work translated . two and half million translations of the latest title in the legendary french comic strip series about two gauls ' adventures in the roman empire went on sale in germany on friday . the germans have a love affair with asterix rivalled only by the french , to the point at which some readers forget what nationality the heroes are .
the release in germany coincided with that in france . uderzo will put in at least three public appearances at frankfurt , vogel said , including a live internet chat with eight of his translators to which fans can " listen in .

" we are only talking about material damage , " kaczynski , who is warsaw 's present-day mayor , told reporters at a briefing . although kaczynski , who is trailing liberal candidate donald tusk in the race for the presidency , which goes to a second round on sunday , denied he was using the lingering animosity between poland and germany to try to win votes , political analyst stanislaw mocek read the opposite into his tactic . " it is surely no fluke that he presented this report today .
it is clearly a new element of his campaign , " said mocek of the polish academy of sciences . " kaczynski is trying to win over older voters who still vividly remember the war .
to the young , the past does n't mean much , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk , presidential candidate from the civic platform party " he is also trying to win votes in the west of the country , in regions that were german before the war , " said mocek .
tusk scored a clear win in the west in the first round of the vote . " not linked in any way " but kaczynski insisted the report was not tied to the election . " work on this report was begun in may 2004 ; it is not linked in any way whatsoever to the electoral calendar , " he told journalists , before recalling his suspicion of poland 's large neighbour to the west , germany , and stressing that poland " needs a president who speaks out decisively , not a president who is open to compromise , as the german press presents donald tusk . " the report , nearly 700 pages long and entitled " warsaw 's losses between 1939 and 1945 , " was commissioned in response to announcements that germans who were expelled from areas in western poland at the end of the war intended to seek compensation for property they had to leave behind . " if germany insists on rewriting history , if there are more demands for compensation ... we have a weapon to defend ourselves with this report , " kaczynski said . " there was no other city in occupied europe which lost more than half its inhabitants and was more than 80 percent destroyed , as was warsaw , " he said . " the germans can not be allowed to present themselves as the second victims of world war two after the jews . " strategy already used fanning the abiding distrust of germany has already been used in the election campaign . last week , kaczynski 's election team accused tusk 's grandfather of fighting in the german army in world war ii , an accusation tusk said " overstepped the bounds of decency " - and which cost kaczynski 's campaign chief jacek kurski his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi troops march into poland in 1939 world war two started with the german invasion of poland , and accusations of collaborating with the nazis during the war still hit home , more than half a century later . " kaczynski always puts himself forward as the only good guy , " said mocek . but neither his accusations about tusk 's grandfather being in the wehrmacht , nor the report on nazi destruction in warsaw , appeared to have done the conservative presidential candidate much good . five days before the second round , opinion polls put tusk in the lead with around 58 percent of the vote , with kaczynski about 15 points behind him . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , warsaw head for cool spell strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .

at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .
they want to know about the things that affect them directly .
which taxes will be raised or lowered ?
will their pensions rise or fall ?
will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?
will driving on the country 's freeways remain free of charge ? all of these questions will be addressed in the coming four weeks of coalition negotiations .
in this respect , the last month , while high drama for journalists , was wasted time in the eyes of most citizens . people are interested in results , even the kind of results that they suspect will be painful .
at the same time , that 's exactly what they are afraid of .
of course people know that five million unemployed will , over time , prove the ruin of the welfare state .
they 're aware that the public coffers are already in critical condition .
but they are very afraid of the actions that need to be taken to solve these problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans voted for reform , but not too much of it it is because the union parties prescribed bitter medicine to address germany 's ills during their election campaign that they did so poorly on election day .
and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .
the remaining tasks at hand could then be tackled by the next government , whatever its composition may be . felix steiner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

11 , 2005 -rrb- what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .
but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question .

at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .
they want to know about the things that affect them directly .
which taxes will be raised or lowered ?
will their pensions rise or fall ?
will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?
will driving on the country 's freeways remain free of charge ? all of these questions will be addressed in the coming four weeks of coalition negotiations .
in this respect , the last month , while high drama for journalists , was wasted time in the eyes of most citizens . people are interested in results , even the kind of results that they suspect will be painful .
at the same time , that 's exactly what they are afraid of .
of course people know that five million unemployed will , over time , prove the ruin of the welfare state .
they 're aware that the public coffers are already in critical condition .
but they are very afraid of the actions that need to be taken to solve these problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans voted for reform , but not too much of it it is because the union parties prescribed bitter medicine to address germany 's ills during their election campaign that they did so poorly on election day .
and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .
the remaining tasks at hand could then be tackled by the next government , whatever its composition may be . felix steiner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.10.2005 federal reform : a critical first step großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rethinking federal and state responsibilities is critical now that angela merkel 's cabinet has been named , it 's time for the hard work to begin .
at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .
they want to know about the things that affect them directly .
which taxes will be raised or lowered ?
will their pensions rise or fall ?
will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?
will driving on the country 's freeways remain free of charge ? all of these questions will be addressed in the coming four weeks of coalition negotiations .
in this respect , the last month , while high drama for journalists , was wasted time in the eyes of most citizens . people are interested in results , even the kind of results that they suspect will be painful .
at the same time , that 's exactly what they are afraid of .
of course people know that five million unemployed will , over time , prove the ruin of the welfare state .
they 're aware that the public coffers are already in critical condition .
but they are very afraid of the actions that need to be taken to solve these problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans voted for reform , but not too much of it it is because the union parties prescribed bitter medicine to address germany 's ills during their election campaign that they did so poorly on election day .
and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .
the remaining tasks at hand could then be tackled by the next government , whatever its composition may be . felix steiner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

some subsidy backers say brussels is keeping them in the dark . first came the proposal to reduce agricultural subsidies ; then came the backlash . peter mandelson , the eu trade commissioner , called for reducing subsidies under the bloc 's common agricultural policy by 70 percent and farm import duties by 60 percent after 2013 . then france , along with a dozen other members , called an emergency meeting tuesday to tie his hands .
they accused him of exceeding his mandate , offering too many concessions in negotiations , and want him restricted before he goes to hong kong in december . france 's main farm union , fnsea , accused mandelson of " sacrificing european agriculture on the altar of economic and social deregulation , " saying thousands of jobs were threatened . not over yet mandelson has been pressuring member states to give him the negotiating power to allow him to reach a deal over farm subsidies , which he says would be to everyone 's benefit - both developing and industrial nations . trade experts say progress on cutting subsidies that developed nations pay to their farmers is crucial to agreeing on a global trade back at wto talks in hong kong in december , which could boost or hinder the world economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson wants his hands untied " the world trade talks are important for all of us , including many developing countries , " he told reporters .
" so it is very important that we are allowed to go forwards and not backwards . " eleven of the union 's 25 members , including britain , support easing subsidies and tariffs during wto negotiations . mandelson has said that his initiative to lower subsidies does not exceed his mandate and denies that he is british prime minister tony blair 's lackey .
blair and french president jacques chirac have fought frequently over eu farm subsidies , which total over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- a year and largely benefit the french . european farmers warn eu meanwhile , european farmers reiterated their demands tuesday that the european commission stay within its mandate , echoing the french government . jean-michel lemetayer , head of the french farmers ' group caf , said that the commission had to know " the limits not to go past , " particularly on the issue of opening up the european market to imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamy wants to see a deal addressing the meeting of 650 members of agriculture groups from across europe , the director-general of the wto , pascal lamy , tried to reassuring those present . " my conviction is that european farmers have no reason to be on the defensive , " lamy said .
" with these negotiations you have the opportunity to win a double dividend , " he said , because european farmers could benefit from agricultural reforms within the european union and from trade reforms by other members of the wto , which could give european manufacturers more access to fast-growing markets like brazil and india . lamy added that the united states had accepted the principle of reducing their agricultural subsidies and that the eu had to demonstrate " greater flexibility " in return .
the us has said europe needs to go further with agricultural subsidy reform . but anxieties within the farming community that the eu commission might go too far in reducing support for its farmers were backed by the president of the agricultural commission in the european parliament , joseph daul . daul said that he had " the painful feeling that the eu is capitulating at the wto .

some subsidy backers say brussels is keeping them in the dark . first came the proposal to reduce agricultural subsidies ; then came the backlash . peter mandelson , the eu trade commissioner , called for reducing subsidies under the bloc 's common agricultural policy by 70 percent and farm import duties by 60 percent after 2013 . then france , along with a dozen other members , called an emergency meeting tuesday to tie his hands .
they accused him of exceeding his mandate , offering too many concessions in negotiations , and want him restricted before he goes to hong kong in december . france 's main farm union , fnsea , accused mandelson of " sacrificing european agriculture on the altar of economic and social deregulation , " saying thousands of jobs were threatened . not over yet mandelson has been pressuring member states to give him the negotiating power to allow him to reach a deal over farm subsidies , which he says would be to everyone 's benefit - both developing and industrial nations . trade experts say progress on cutting subsidies that developed nations pay to their farmers is crucial to agreeing on a global trade back at wto talks in hong kong in december , which could boost or hinder the world economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson wants his hands untied " the world trade talks are important for all of us , including many developing countries , " he told reporters .
" so it is very important that we are allowed to go forwards and not backwards . " eleven of the union 's 25 members , including britain , support easing subsidies and tariffs during wto negotiations . mandelson has said that his initiative to lower subsidies does not exceed his mandate and denies that he is british prime minister tony blair 's lackey .
blair and french president jacques chirac have fought frequently over eu farm subsidies , which total over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- a year and largely benefit the french . european farmers warn eu meanwhile , european farmers reiterated their demands tuesday that the european commission stay within its mandate , echoing the french government . jean-michel lemetayer , head of the french farmers ' group caf , said that the commission had to know " the limits not to go past , " particularly on the issue of opening up the european market to imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamy wants to see a deal addressing the meeting of 650 members of agriculture groups from across europe , the director-general of the wto , pascal lamy , tried to reassuring those present . " my conviction is that european farmers have no reason to be on the defensive , " lamy said .
" with these negotiations you have the opportunity to win a double dividend , " he said , because european farmers could benefit from agricultural reforms within the european union and from trade reforms by other members of the wto , which could give european manufacturers more access to fast-growing markets like brazil and india . lamy added that the united states had accepted the principle of reducing their agricultural subsidies and that the eu had to demonstrate " greater flexibility " in return .
the us has said europe needs to go further with agricultural subsidy reform . but anxieties within the farming community that the eu commission might go too far in reducing support for its farmers were backed by the president of the agricultural commission in the european parliament , joseph daul . daul said that he had " the painful feeling that the eu is capitulating at the wto .

fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds europe -pipe- 18.10.2005 bird flu confirmed in greece , fears mount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the risk of infected poultry is rising in europe concerns over the spread of bird flu in europe continued to grow after a related form of the h5n1 virus was discovered in greece as consumers across europe begin losing their appetite for chicken . the greek agriculture ministry said it had detected the h5 strain of the virus - of which the deadly h5n1 is a member - on the aegean islet of inoussess off the island of chios , just a few miles from turkey , which has also confirmed cases of bird flu . the greek authorities , which took nine samples from poultry on the islet last week found the presence of the h5 strain in a turkey , but have not yet confirmed whether it is the deadly strain . agriculture minister evangelos bassiakos said experts would need " seven or eight days " to carry out further tests to establish exactly what they are dealing with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is taking the threat of the virus seriously if confirmed as the h5n1 strain , which has already claimed 60 lives in asia , it would be the first case in the european union .
the infected turkey came from a small private poultry farm on the tiny island , and the authorities there have confirmed that they will cull all the other birds and medically examine the farmer 's family . the european union commission responded to the latest discovery by saying it would ban the export of live birds and bird related products from the chios area .
and the island 's prefect , polidoras lambrinoudis told the reuters news agency that no poultry or eggs were now allowed to leave the island . " risk to human health is conceivable , but minimal " so far , there have been no human cases of bird flu reported in europe , but the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has warned european nations not to divert funding and attention away from asia , which is the most likely breeding ground for the mutation of the virus into a form which is easily transmitted between humans . peter cordingly of the who says there is a lot of anxiety in europe which could mean that " governments might focus on domestic preparedness and forget the fact that ground zero is southeast asia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of birds have been culled in southeast asia health experts say that the fight against bird flu is being hampered by huge differences in wealth between nations .
some countries have poor public health infrastructures and no stockpiles of the expensive anti-viral drugs which could help to limit a human pandemic . millions of birds in the region have already been culled in an attempt to stop the spread of the h5n1 strain , which first emerged in hong kong in 1997 . europe is keen to strike a balance between testing for outbreaks of the deadly bird flu and the need to play down the threat to the public . " the risk to human health , to public health , is minimal , " zsuzanna jakab , the director of the european centre for disease prevention and control -lrb- ecdc -rrb- told a news conference .
" it is conceivable , but minimal . " but who influenza program director klaus stoehr warns of the devastating consequences if the disease is not contained . " we do n't know whether a pandemic will break out in the coming weeks , months , or only in years .
but there 's no question that if such a pandemic occurs we 'll be looking at hundreds of thousands or even millions of deaths worldwide , " he said . chicken is off the menu consumers across europe are responding to the westward spread of bird flu by turning away from chicken and other poultry .
reassurances that cooking chicken at temperatures above 160 degrees fahrenheit destroys the virus have done little to allay fears , with farmers and supermarkets across much of the continent reporting a drop in sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers in southern europe are reportedly off poultry farmers in turkey say that poultry sales have fallen by 50 percent , and several restaurants have already removed white meat from their menus .
even france has reported a ten percent slíde in poultry deliveries , and one supermarket chain , systeme u , said sales had slumped by as much as 30 percent over the past few days . the trend was echoed in switzerland , italy and hungary , which shares a border with romania where cases of the deadly disease were discovered earlier this month . by contrast consumers in a number of northern european countries , including britain and denmark have not started to rethink their menus , and farming representatives in both belgium and the netherlands say there has been no noticeable change in poultry consumption . the german federation for the poultry industry , which represents 8,000 farms , stressed that german consumers had not lost their appetite for white meat . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time .

and the island 's prefect , polidoras lambrinoudis told the reuters news agency that no poultry or eggs were now allowed to leave the island . " risk to human health is conceivable , but minimal " so far , there have been no human cases of bird flu reported in europe , but the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has warned european nations not to divert funding and attention away from asia , which is the most likely breeding ground for the mutation of the virus into a form which is easily transmitted between humans . peter cordingly of the who says there is a lot of anxiety in europe which could mean that " governments might focus on domestic preparedness and forget the fact that ground zero is southeast asia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of birds have been culled in southeast asia health experts say that the fight against bird flu is being hampered by huge differences in wealth between nations .
some countries have poor public health infrastructures and no stockpiles of the expensive anti-viral drugs which could help to limit a human pandemic . millions of birds in the region have already been culled in an attempt to stop the spread of the h5n1 strain , which first emerged in hong kong in 1997 . europe is keen to strike a balance between testing for outbreaks of the deadly bird flu and the need to play down the threat to the public . " the risk to human health , to public health , is minimal , " zsuzanna jakab , the director of the european centre for disease prevention and control -lrb- ecdc -rrb- told a news conference .
" it is conceivable , but minimal . " but who influenza program director klaus stoehr warns of the devastating consequences if the disease is not contained . " we do n't know whether a pandemic will break out in the coming weeks , months , or only in years .
but there 's no question that if such a pandemic occurs we 'll be looking at hundreds of thousands or even millions of deaths worldwide , " he said . chicken is off the menu consumers across europe are responding to the westward spread of bird flu by turning away from chicken and other poultry .
reassurances that cooking chicken at temperatures above 160 degrees fahrenheit destroys the virus have done little to allay fears , with farmers and supermarkets across much of the continent reporting a drop in sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers in southern europe are reportedly off poultry farmers in turkey say that poultry sales have fallen by 50 percent , and several restaurants have already removed white meat from their menus .
even france has reported a ten percent slíde in poultry deliveries , and one supermarket chain , systeme u , said sales had slumped by as much as 30 percent over the past few days . the trend was echoed in switzerland , italy and hungary , which shares a border with romania where cases of the deadly disease were discovered earlier this month . by contrast consumers in a number of northern european countries , including britain and denmark have not started to rethink their menus , and farming representatives in both belgium and the netherlands say there has been no noticeable change in poultry consumption . the german federation for the poultry industry , which represents 8,000 farms , stressed that german consumers had not lost their appetite for white meat . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time .

the bundestag is expected to sit in mid-november to formally elect merkel as chancellor . " we must take this criticism seriously " the oldest member of the bundestag , interior minster otto schilly officially opened the session .

the party unites former east german communists with former leftwing spd members who were critical of gerhard schröder ’ s economic and welfare reforms , which they described as unfair to the poor .
the environmentalist greens are convinced that neither the government nor the two other opposition parties are sufficiently committed to environmentally sound policies . problems at home ? meanwhile , the german press on tuesday predicted problems ahead for merkel from her own camp following the nomination of seehofer to the agriculture ministry . known for his stance on the left wing of the conservatives , seehofer has clashed with merkel over her proposals to reform the health service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trouble from within - edmund stoiber and merkel have their differences edmund stoiber , the head of the csu and the new economy minister , insisted on seehofer 's nomination to government in exchange for his support .

" it all looks like a museum depicting the cold war - it looks like make-believe , " hwang said . lost without translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt book fair focused on arabic literature last year the lack of german translations of korean works has made for a two-year race against time to get some 100 titles ready for the book fair . according to the festival spokeswoman caroline vogel , it proved to be an impossible deadline . " it is very difficult because there are not enough translations and there are not enough translators .
it is literature and not everybody can translate literature , " vogel said . " but it is always like this .
last year it was the same problem for arab authors , and i think the koreans have managed almost 80 translations . " at a kiosk near you bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asterix is in lofty company at the world 's most important book fair asterix creator albert uderzo , on the other hand , does not have any problems getting his work translated . two and half million translations of the latest title in the legendary french comic strip series about two gauls ' adventures in the roman empire went on sale in germany on friday . the germans have a love affair with asterix rivalled only by the french , to the point at which some readers forget what nationality the heroes are .
the release in germany coincided with that in france . uderzo will put in at least three public appearances at frankfurt , vogel said , including a live internet chat with eight of his translators to which fans can " listen in . " the most exhibitors ever frankfurt remains the biggest book forum for english language publishers , surpassing even the london book fair .
this year will have the most exhibitors yet with 7,000 expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret atwood , a pioneer of canadian women 's writing publishers are bringing out feminist writer margaret atwood alongside top-selling english authors nick hornby and ken follet , as well as controversial turkish author ohran pamuk .
pamuk 's seventh novel , " snow , " which tells of a surreal homecoming amid a wave of suicides prompted by a ban on the muslim headscarf , has earned him comparisons with german modernist master franz kafka . also coming to the fair is the dutch poet , novelist and playwright cees nooteboom , who has frequently been mentioned as a candidate for the nobel literature prize . echoes from sweden this year , the world 's most prestigious literary award went to british playwright harold pinter , who is published in germany by rowohlt , the same publishing house that struck it lucky last year when austria 's elfriede jelinek won the nobel prize . some 240,000 copies of her novels and plays sold within days of the announcement of the swedish academy 's decision last year , which is why rowohlt is expected to prepare for a pinter rush in frankfurt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders ' latest film will be screened during the book fair if the book fair keeps growing , vogel said it is not because the book market itself is getting bigger , but because it is moving with the times and adding innovative categories to the event . this year will see an antique book fair and a new section on magazines , while german director wim wenders is coming for a screening of his latest film " do n't come knocking " in the cinema section . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de harold pinter wins nobel literature prize leading british playwright harold pinter won the 2005 nobel literature prize on thursday , the swedish academy announced .

reassurances that cooking chicken at temperatures above 160 degrees fahrenheit destroys the virus have done little to allay fears , with farmers and supermarkets across much of the continent reporting a drop in sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers in southern europe are reportedly off poultry farmers in turkey say that poultry sales have fallen by 50 percent , and several restaurants have already removed white meat from their menus .
even france has reported a ten percent slíde in poultry deliveries , and one supermarket chain , systeme u , said sales had slumped by as much as 30 percent over the past few days . the trend was echoed in switzerland , italy and hungary , which shares a border with romania where cases of the deadly disease were discovered earlier this month . by contrast consumers in a number of northern european countries , including britain and denmark have not started to rethink their menus , and farming representatives in both belgium and the netherlands say there has been no noticeable change in poultry consumption . the german federation for the poultry industry , which represents 8,000 farms , stressed that german consumers had not lost their appetite for white meat . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time .

27 and 28 . " france supports the spanish idea of a european-african conference on immigration , " french prime minister dominique de villepin said on monday after holding discussions with his spanish counterpart jose luis rodriguez zapatero in barcelona . " all of our countries are confronted today with this question of immigration .
we should treat it with courage , daring and imagination , " de villepin added . " spain and france will present a joint initiative at the next european council on a global plan on a response to immigration ... which commits the eu much more than it has been up to now , " prime minister zapatero told the press conference . the issue came to a head last month with a series of assaults by thousands of sub-saharan african immigrants on fencing at the spanish border surrounding the north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla - africa 's only land border with the eu . deaths and mayhem at spain 's african border at least 14 people have died in their attempt to leap over the heavily defended borders after trekking across vast swathes of africa to northern morocco .
some of them have been shot by moroccan security forces while desperately attempting to reach a better life in europe . bildunterschrift : african immigrants in a transit camp near spain after struggling for some time to keep the waves of immigrants from swamping its borders , spain has repeatedly called on the eu to get a grip on the roots of the illegal immigration problem by aiding the poor african countries from where migrants originate .
the reasoning behind this policy being that if better opportunities existed at home , there would be less reason for migrants to risk their lives in attempting to reach the wealthy eu . zapatero told his french counterpart that illegal immigration from sub-saharan africa was an issue that concerned the whole of africa and europe and one that morocco and spain could not deal with alone . zapatero calls on eu to avert " humanitarian drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero spoke to chirac about the immigration issue .
" europe refuses to take the african immigrants , but spain and morocco can not play the role of eu policeman on their own , " a spanish spokesman told afp on behalf of the prime minister , adding it was " time to act " to solve a " humanitarian drama . "
zapatero himself revealed that he had spoken directly by phone with french president jacques chirac about the issue . as well as storming the borders around ceuta and melilla , thousands more african migrants take to rickety boats each year in a perilous trip to the canary islands or across the gibraltar strait to southern spain .
many don ’ t make it across alive . french pm sketches out two-pronged strategy while zapatero provided no details of the proposal , de villepin hinted at a two-pronged strategy which would combine improving controls along the border regions with a development and training program in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin .
the french prime minister added that transit countries for immigrants should also be given support in protecting their borders under a new , broad european immigration policy . spain annoyed some of its eu partners earlier this year by giving documentation to hundreds of thousands of immigrants who had been working illegally in spain and then had irritated them further recently by allowing “ thousands ” more to enter spain .. neighbors " irritated " by spanish policy the spanish daily abc reported that the french and german interior ministers had complained " this week " about spain 's immigration policy , saying " 25,000 illegals from black africa have crossed the pyrenees in the past few months " to france , belgium and the netherlands . quoting police experts , abc said another 25,000 were still in spain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily the paper added that french interior minister nicolas sarkozy had called the spanish government the " sorcerer 's apprentice " in terms of immigration and called the country “ an open door ” while the paper quoted german counterpart otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- as saying that " massive -lrb- immigrant -rrb- regularization has the knock-on effect of attracting new illegals .

" we are only talking about material damage , " kaczynski , who is warsaw 's present-day mayor , told reporters at a briefing . although kaczynski , who is trailing liberal candidate donald tusk in the race for the presidency , which goes to a second round on sunday , denied he was using the lingering animosity between poland and germany to try to win votes , political analyst stanislaw mocek read the opposite into his tactic . " it is surely no fluke that he presented this report today .
it is clearly a new element of his campaign , " said mocek of the polish academy of sciences . " kaczynski is trying to win over older voters who still vividly remember the war .
to the young , the past does n't mean much , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk , presidential candidate from the civic platform party " he is also trying to win votes in the west of the country , in regions that were german before the war , " said mocek .
tusk scored a clear win in the west in the first round of the vote . " not linked in any way " but kaczynski insisted the report was not tied to the election . " work on this report was begun in may 2004 ; it is not linked in any way whatsoever to the electoral calendar , " he told journalists , before recalling his suspicion of poland 's large neighbour to the west , germany , and stressing that poland " needs a president who speaks out decisively , not a president who is open to compromise , as the german press presents donald tusk . " the report , nearly 700 pages long and entitled " warsaw 's losses between 1939 and 1945 , " was commissioned in response to announcements that germans who were expelled from areas in western poland at the end of the war intended to seek compensation for property they had to leave behind . " if germany insists on rewriting history , if there are more demands for compensation ... we have a weapon to defend ourselves with this report , " kaczynski said . " there was no other city in occupied europe which lost more than half its inhabitants and was more than 80 percent destroyed , as was warsaw , " he said . " the germans can not be allowed to present themselves as the second victims of world war two after the jews . " strategy already used fanning the abiding distrust of germany has already been used in the election campaign . last week , kaczynski 's election team accused tusk 's grandfather of fighting in the german army in world war ii , an accusation tusk said " overstepped the bounds of decency " - and which cost kaczynski 's campaign chief jacek kurski his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi troops march into poland in 1939 world war two started with the german invasion of poland , and accusations of collaborating with the nazis during the war still hit home , more than half a century later . " kaczynski always puts himself forward as the only good guy , " said mocek . but neither his accusations about tusk 's grandfather being in the wehrmacht , nor the report on nazi destruction in warsaw , appeared to have done the conservative presidential candidate much good . five days before the second round , opinion polls put tusk in the lead with around 58 percent of the vote , with kaczynski about 15 points behind him . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , warsaw head for cool spell strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .

27 and 28 . " france supports the spanish idea of a european-african conference on immigration , " french prime minister dominique de villepin said on monday after holding discussions with his spanish counterpart jose luis rodriguez zapatero in barcelona . " all of our countries are confronted today with this question of immigration .
we should treat it with courage , daring and imagination , " de villepin added . " spain and france will present a joint initiative at the next european council on a global plan on a response to immigration ... which commits the eu much more than it has been up to now , " prime minister zapatero told the press conference . the issue came to a head last month with a series of assaults by thousands of sub-saharan african immigrants on fencing at the spanish border surrounding the north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla - africa 's only land border with the eu . deaths and mayhem at spain 's african border at least 14 people have died in their attempt to leap over the heavily defended borders after trekking across vast swathes of africa to northern morocco .
some of them have been shot by moroccan security forces while desperately attempting to reach a better life in europe . bildunterschrift : african immigrants in a transit camp near spain after struggling for some time to keep the waves of immigrants from swamping its borders , spain has repeatedly called on the eu to get a grip on the roots of the illegal immigration problem by aiding the poor african countries from where migrants originate .

things got worse when a criminal network was uncovered .
the scandal returns as the trial of those involved starts tuesday . it was the scandal that dulled the shine on germany ’ s successful campaign to host the 2006 world cup .
on tuesday , the specter of match-fixing and corruption in german soccer rears its ugly head once again when the disgraced bundesliga referee robert hoyzer and five others come to court to face fraud charges . hoyzer and his alleged cohorts are at the center of germany ’ s biggest sporting embarrassment ; a scandal involving crooked match officials , greedy and corrupt players and a network of gangsters which stretched from germany to turkey and beyond . the affair tells the story of games thrown for money , a widespread illegal betting cartel and the threats and intimidation that went with instigating a match-rigging operation which threatened to undermine the very structure of soccer in germany . trial likely to coincide with world cup draw tuesday 's opening session in berlin 's superior court will reopen wounds inflicted on the game that have barely had time to scab over .
and with the world cup due to kick off in less than nine months , german soccer authorities are hoping that the trial is concluded swiftly .
an on-going process dealing with the most sordid episode in the german game for 30 years would hardly be the best byline for the headlines trumpeting the start of germany ’ s moment in the global soccer sun . with full and partial confessions from all but one of the defendants , the trial is unlikely to still be going on by the time the first ball is kicked on june 8 , 2006 .
however , with sessions initially scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays and with lawyers in the case predicting anything from six to 12 sessions needed to conclude the case , it will almost certainly still be going on when the sport 's most powerful figures gather in leipzig before the draw for the world cup tournament on december 9 . disgraced referee hoyzer back in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer went underground after his release the trial will bring robert hoyzer back into the spotlight and will lay bare once more the details of the 26-year old ’ s involvement as a central figure in the scandal . the berlin-based former referee officiated at matches in the second division and lower leagues in the bundesliga but hit the headlines after it was revealed at the start of 2005 that he took a bribe to throw the result of the german cup first round game between top flight side hamburg sv and regional league side paderborn on august 21 , 2004 . hamburg had been leading 2-0 , but went on to lose 4-2 after hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg striker emile mpenza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei barbarez remonstrates with hoyzer in the notorious match as the investigation went on , it was revealed that hoyzer may have been involved with the fixing or attempted fixing of nine matches in total .
according to reports at the time , further investigation into hoyzer uncovered that he was paid bribes totaling 67,000 euros and was given a flat-screen television . he was arrested in february and spent two weeks in custody .
during his time in incarceration , hoyzer co-operated with berlin prosecutors and the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , who later banned him for life .
he faces 11 charges at trial , including complicity to defraud . official and shamed player face rigging charges as well as hoyer , referee dominik marks and former top flight player steffen karl are charged with involvement in the rigging of matches between april and december last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominik marks maintains his innocence marks has been accused of fixing two matches by hoyzer , one in the second division and the other in the regional northern league .
he was arrested in march 9 and spent four weeks in custody under suspicion of match-fixing .
despite maintaining his innocence , marks faces five charges . karl , a former defensive midfielder for borussia dortmund and hertha berlin , is accused of throwing games for financial gain and faces five charges . all three are accused of involvement under the orders of three croatian brothers who betted on the results .
it is thought that ante sapina , one of the brothers and the alleged gambling ringleader , made over 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.20 million -rrb- on two rigged matches alone . croatians at the heart of betting cartel # b # ante , at 27 the youngest of the three sapina brothers , faces 42 charges including the running of an illegal match-fixing operation .
the 40-year old eldest brother milan faces 11 charges of betting on rigged matches while 37-year old filip , who has apparently co-operated with investigators , faces four similar charges . the defendants will be required to enter a plea at the beginning of the trial with all – except marks – expected to plead guilty .
the offences could bring jail terms of up to 10 years , although lawyers from the defense counsel hope that the confessions and a lack of previous convictions will lead to sentences nearer the one year minimum . investigation uncovers widespread corruption in total , berlin prosecutors have investigated 25 people in connection with the scandal , many of whom are suspected of having been involved in manipulating at least 10 matches in 2004 .
there have also been 14 players investigated , from second division clubs energie cottbus , dynamo dresden and regional sides chemnitzer fc , kickers offenbach and sc paderborn . prosecutors have also seized 2.44 million euros in bank accounts and of assets belonging to the three sapina brothers during february raids . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a shadow over german soccer german soccer has struggled recently .

things got worse when a criminal network was uncovered .
the scandal returns as the trial of those involved starts tuesday . it was the scandal that dulled the shine on germany ’ s successful campaign to host the 2006 world cup .
on tuesday , the specter of match-fixing and corruption in german soccer rears its ugly head once again when the disgraced bundesliga referee robert hoyzer and five others come to court to face fraud charges . hoyzer and his alleged cohorts are at the center of germany ’ s biggest sporting embarrassment ; a scandal involving crooked match officials , greedy and corrupt players and a network of gangsters which stretched from germany to turkey and beyond . the affair tells the story of games thrown for money , a widespread illegal betting cartel and the threats and intimidation that went with instigating a match-rigging operation which threatened to undermine the very structure of soccer in germany . trial likely to coincide with world cup draw tuesday 's opening session in berlin 's superior court will reopen wounds inflicted on the game that have barely had time to scab over .
and with the world cup due to kick off in less than nine months , german soccer authorities are hoping that the trial is concluded swiftly .
an on-going process dealing with the most sordid episode in the german game for 30 years would hardly be the best byline for the headlines trumpeting the start of germany ’ s moment in the global soccer sun . with full and partial confessions from all but one of the defendants , the trial is unlikely to still be going on by the time the first ball is kicked on june 8 , 2006 .

a controversial figure , schäuble returns to the position which he held under former chancellor helmut kohl . wolfgang schäuble is considered by many to be the most experienced member of chancellor-designate angela merkel 's new coalition government . schäuble , 63 , made his career in the ample shadow of former chancellor kohl when he was considered the chancellor 's closest confidant . merkel 's conservatives named the respected cdu veteran to head the interior ministry , a position he also held from 1989-1991 . schäubles rise to the top wolfgang schäuble is a protestant who was born in freiburg in 1942 . a trained lawyer by profession , he has served as an elected official for over 35 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble survived an assasination attempt by a mentally ill man in 1990 .
confined to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 that left him paralyzed him from the waist down , schäuble is considered one of the architects of german reunification . he served as interior minister in the kohl government and was chief whip of the cdu , building a reputation as a cross-party deal-maker in germany 's complex system of federal government .
during the kohl years he came to be regarded as the chancellor 's political confidante and in return for his loyalty was the only candidate allowed to rise to a position of influence within the party .
when mr kohl finally stepped down , following the cdu 's 1998 election defeat mr schäuble , inherited the leadership of the cdu .
finance scandal damages cdu just over a year after being voted out of office , helmut kohl admitted in a tv interview that the cdu had received approximately two million deutsche marks in secret donations between 1993 and 1998 .
these donations , which were not published in the party 's annual finance reports , were then funnelled back into the coffers of regional and local cdu party branches , to cover campaign costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble was considered by many to be helmut kohls right hand man when the allegations first emerged in 1999 , schäuble promised quick party-wide investigations and acted carefully to minimize political damage to his predecessor and one-time mentor . however by the beginning of 2000 it was clear that the cdu 's funding scandal engulf him as well . schäuble admitted on january 10 , 2000 , that he had received a cash donation of 100,000 dm from karlheinz schreiber , a bavarian businessman and arms dealer .
schäuble declared that this donation had not been published in the party 's official records .
he blamed brigitte baumeister , the former party treasurer , for this " mistake " and denies any personal wrong-doing . reluctant bedfellows ? chancellor-designate merkel took over the leadership of the cdu from schäuble in 2000 . but despite severe criticism from both within and outside of his party schäuble eventually salvaged his reputation and became one of germany 's most respected politicians .
he suffered a setback in 2004 when merkel refused to back him for the role of federal president , preferring the cdu 's former head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , for the job .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble congratulates angela merkel in 1998 after she was elected as cdu general secretary relations between merkel and schäuble have improved over the years but he is not regarded as a close ally .
still , many observers say merkel is turning to him now because she knows his political know-how will be essential if a potentially fractious government is to work . merkel has a history of sidelining party rivals and that has left her with few experienced conservative allies for top posts .
her party 's unexpectedly poor result in a sept .

27 and 28 . " france supports the spanish idea of a european-african conference on immigration , " french prime minister dominique de villepin said on monday after holding discussions with his spanish counterpart jose luis rodriguez zapatero in barcelona . " all of our countries are confronted today with this question of immigration .
we should treat it with courage , daring and imagination , " de villepin added . " spain and france will present a joint initiative at the next european council on a global plan on a response to immigration ... which commits the eu much more than it has been up to now , " prime minister zapatero told the press conference . the issue came to a head last month with a series of assaults by thousands of sub-saharan african immigrants on fencing at the spanish border surrounding the north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla - africa 's only land border with the eu . deaths and mayhem at spain 's african border at least 14 people have died in their attempt to leap over the heavily defended borders after trekking across vast swathes of africa to northern morocco .
some of them have been shot by moroccan security forces while desperately attempting to reach a better life in europe . bildunterschrift : african immigrants in a transit camp near spain after struggling for some time to keep the waves of immigrants from swamping its borders , spain has repeatedly called on the eu to get a grip on the roots of the illegal immigration problem by aiding the poor african countries from where migrants originate .
the reasoning behind this policy being that if better opportunities existed at home , there would be less reason for migrants to risk their lives in attempting to reach the wealthy eu . zapatero told his french counterpart that illegal immigration from sub-saharan africa was an issue that concerned the whole of africa and europe and one that morocco and spain could not deal with alone . zapatero calls on eu to avert " humanitarian drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero spoke to chirac about the immigration issue .
" europe refuses to take the african immigrants , but spain and morocco can not play the role of eu policeman on their own , " a spanish spokesman told afp on behalf of the prime minister , adding it was " time to act " to solve a " humanitarian drama . "
zapatero himself revealed that he had spoken directly by phone with french president jacques chirac about the issue . as well as storming the borders around ceuta and melilla , thousands more african migrants take to rickety boats each year in a perilous trip to the canary islands or across the gibraltar strait to southern spain .
many don ’ t make it across alive . french pm sketches out two-pronged strategy while zapatero provided no details of the proposal , de villepin hinted at a two-pronged strategy which would combine improving controls along the border regions with a development and training program in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin .
the french prime minister added that transit countries for immigrants should also be given support in protecting their borders under a new , broad european immigration policy . spain annoyed some of its eu partners earlier this year by giving documentation to hundreds of thousands of immigrants who had been working illegally in spain and then had irritated them further recently by allowing “ thousands ” more to enter spain .. neighbors " irritated " by spanish policy the spanish daily abc reported that the french and german interior ministers had complained " this week " about spain 's immigration policy , saying " 25,000 illegals from black africa have crossed the pyrenees in the past few months " to france , belgium and the netherlands . quoting police experts , abc said another 25,000 were still in spain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily the paper added that french interior minister nicolas sarkozy had called the spanish government the " sorcerer 's apprentice " in terms of immigration and called the country “ an open door ” while the paper quoted german counterpart otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- as saying that " massive -lrb- immigrant -rrb- regularization has the knock-on effect of attracting new illegals .

the bundestag is expected to sit in mid-november to formally elect merkel as chancellor . " we must take this criticism seriously " the oldest member of the bundestag , interior minster otto schilly officially opened the session .
afterwards , norbert lammert , a christian democrat who has been a member of parliament for 25 years , was elected its new speaker , replacing social democrat wolfgang thierse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new speaker , nobert lammert -lrb- left -rrb- , with angela merkel " neither germany ’ s parties and parliament nor the government and opposition are currently highly regarded by the german public , " said lammert .
" we must take this criticism seriously , because the huge challenges our country is facing can only be tackled if germans regain trust in their political institutions . " merkel 's christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , have 226 seats in the lower house , just four more than schröder 's social democrats .
despite having given up his ambitions of serving a third term as chancellor , schröder retains a seat in the bundestag . attack on all fronts the rest of the parliament is made up by the free democrats with 61 seats , the 54 lawmakers of the left party - a mix of former communists and disgruntled social democrats - and the former governing coalition partners , the greens , who have 51 seats . germany ’ s new left party already vowed to attack the new government , especially on its social policies .
the party unites former east german communists with former leftwing spd members who were critical of gerhard schröder ’ s economic and welfare reforms , which they described as unfair to the poor .
the environmentalist greens are convinced that neither the government nor the two other opposition parties are sufficiently committed to environmentally sound policies . problems at home ? meanwhile , the german press on tuesday predicted problems ahead for merkel from her own camp following the nomination of seehofer to the agriculture ministry . known for his stance on the left wing of the conservatives , seehofer has clashed with merkel over her proposals to reform the health service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trouble from within - edmund stoiber and merkel have their differences edmund stoiber , the head of the csu and the new economy minister , insisted on seehofer 's nomination to government in exchange for his support . " stoiber could not have brought a stronger merkel opponent into the cabinet , " commented the left-wing tageszeitung daily . other newspapers said seehofer was likely to side with the eight social democrat ministers in the government in opposing large-scale reforms . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de federal reform : a critical first step now that angela merkel 's cabinet has been named , it 's time for the hard work to begin .

the bundestag is expected to sit in mid-november to formally elect merkel as chancellor . " we must take this criticism seriously " the oldest member of the bundestag , interior minster otto schilly officially opened the session .
afterwards , norbert lammert , a christian democrat who has been a member of parliament for 25 years , was elected its new speaker , replacing social democrat wolfgang thierse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new speaker , nobert lammert -lrb- left -rrb- , with angela merkel " neither germany ’ s parties and parliament nor the government and opposition are currently highly regarded by the german public , " said lammert .
" we must take this criticism seriously , because the huge challenges our country is facing can only be tackled if germans regain trust in their political institutions . " merkel 's christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , have 226 seats in the lower house , just four more than schröder 's social democrats .
despite having given up his ambitions of serving a third term as chancellor , schröder retains a seat in the bundestag . attack on all fronts the rest of the parliament is made up by the free democrats with 61 seats , the 54 lawmakers of the left party - a mix of former communists and disgruntled social democrats - and the former governing coalition partners , the greens , who have 51 seats . germany ’ s new left party already vowed to attack the new government , especially on its social policies .
the party unites former east german communists with former leftwing spd members who were critical of gerhard schröder ’ s economic and welfare reforms , which they described as unfair to the poor .
the environmentalist greens are convinced that neither the government nor the two other opposition parties are sufficiently committed to environmentally sound policies . problems at home ? meanwhile , the german press on tuesday predicted problems ahead for merkel from her own camp following the nomination of seehofer to the agriculture ministry . known for his stance on the left wing of the conservatives , seehofer has clashed with merkel over her proposals to reform the health service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trouble from within - edmund stoiber and merkel have their differences edmund stoiber , the head of the csu and the new economy minister , insisted on seehofer 's nomination to government in exchange for his support . " stoiber could not have brought a stronger merkel opponent into the cabinet , " commented the left-wing tageszeitung daily . other newspapers said seehofer was likely to side with the eight social democrat ministers in the government in opposing large-scale reforms . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de federal reform : a critical first step now that angela merkel 's cabinet has been named , it 's time for the hard work to begin .
at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform .

things got worse when a criminal network was uncovered .
the scandal returns as the trial of those involved starts tuesday . it was the scandal that dulled the shine on germany ’ s successful campaign to host the 2006 world cup .
on tuesday , the specter of match-fixing and corruption in german soccer rears its ugly head once again when the disgraced bundesliga referee robert hoyzer and five others come to court to face fraud charges . hoyzer and his alleged cohorts are at the center of germany ’ s biggest sporting embarrassment ; a scandal involving crooked match officials , greedy and corrupt players and a network of gangsters which stretched from germany to turkey and beyond . the affair tells the story of games thrown for money , a widespread illegal betting cartel and the threats and intimidation that went with instigating a match-rigging operation which threatened to undermine the very structure of soccer in germany . trial likely to coincide with world cup draw tuesday 's opening session in berlin 's superior court will reopen wounds inflicted on the game that have barely had time to scab over .
and with the world cup due to kick off in less than nine months , german soccer authorities are hoping that the trial is concluded swiftly .
an on-going process dealing with the most sordid episode in the german game for 30 years would hardly be the best byline for the headlines trumpeting the start of germany ’ s moment in the global soccer sun . with full and partial confessions from all but one of the defendants , the trial is unlikely to still be going on by the time the first ball is kicked on june 8 , 2006 .
however , with sessions initially scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays and with lawyers in the case predicting anything from six to 12 sessions needed to conclude the case , it will almost certainly still be going on when the sport 's most powerful figures gather in leipzig before the draw for the world cup tournament on december 9 . disgraced referee hoyzer back in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer went underground after his release the trial will bring robert hoyzer back into the spotlight and will lay bare once more the details of the 26-year old ’ s involvement as a central figure in the scandal . the berlin-based former referee officiated at matches in the second division and lower leagues in the bundesliga but hit the headlines after it was revealed at the start of 2005 that he took a bribe to throw the result of the german cup first round game between top flight side hamburg sv and regional league side paderborn on august 21 , 2004 . hamburg had been leading 2-0 , but went on to lose 4-2 after hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg striker emile mpenza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei barbarez remonstrates with hoyzer in the notorious match as the investigation went on , it was revealed that hoyzer may have been involved with the fixing or attempted fixing of nine matches in total .
according to reports at the time , further investigation into hoyzer uncovered that he was paid bribes totaling 67,000 euros and was given a flat-screen television . he was arrested in february and spent two weeks in custody .
during his time in incarceration , hoyzer co-operated with berlin prosecutors and the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , who later banned him for life .
he faces 11 charges at trial , including complicity to defraud . official and shamed player face rigging charges as well as hoyer , referee dominik marks and former top flight player steffen karl are charged with involvement in the rigging of matches between april and december last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominik marks maintains his innocence marks has been accused of fixing two matches by hoyzer , one in the second division and the other in the regional northern league .

the offences could bring jail terms of up to 10 years , although lawyers from the defense counsel hope that the confessions and a lack of previous convictions will lead to sentences nearer the one year minimum . investigation uncovers widespread corruption in total , berlin prosecutors have investigated 25 people in connection with the scandal , many of whom are suspected of having been involved in manipulating at least 10 matches in 2004 .

things got worse when a criminal network was uncovered .
the scandal returns as the trial of those involved starts tuesday . it was the scandal that dulled the shine on germany ’ s successful campaign to host the 2006 world cup .
on tuesday , the specter of match-fixing and corruption in german soccer rears its ugly head once again when the disgraced bundesliga referee robert hoyzer and five others come to court to face fraud charges . hoyzer and his alleged cohorts are at the center of germany ’ s biggest sporting embarrassment ; a scandal involving crooked match officials , greedy and corrupt players and a network of gangsters which stretched from germany to turkey and beyond . the affair tells the story of games thrown for money , a widespread illegal betting cartel and the threats and intimidation that went with instigating a match-rigging operation which threatened to undermine the very structure of soccer in germany . trial likely to coincide with world cup draw tuesday 's opening session in berlin 's superior court will reopen wounds inflicted on the game that have barely had time to scab over .
and with the world cup due to kick off in less than nine months , german soccer authorities are hoping that the trial is concluded swiftly .
an on-going process dealing with the most sordid episode in the german game for 30 years would hardly be the best byline for the headlines trumpeting the start of germany ’ s moment in the global soccer sun . with full and partial confessions from all but one of the defendants , the trial is unlikely to still be going on by the time the first ball is kicked on june 8 , 2006 .
however , with sessions initially scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays and with lawyers in the case predicting anything from six to 12 sessions needed to conclude the case , it will almost certainly still be going on when the sport 's most powerful figures gather in leipzig before the draw for the world cup tournament on december 9 . disgraced referee hoyzer back in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer went underground after his release the trial will bring robert hoyzer back into the spotlight and will lay bare once more the details of the 26-year old ’ s involvement as a central figure in the scandal . the berlin-based former referee officiated at matches in the second division and lower leagues in the bundesliga but hit the headlines after it was revealed at the start of 2005 that he took a bribe to throw the result of the german cup first round game between top flight side hamburg sv and regional league side paderborn on august 21 , 2004 . hamburg had been leading 2-0 , but went on to lose 4-2 after hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg striker emile mpenza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei barbarez remonstrates with hoyzer in the notorious match as the investigation went on , it was revealed that hoyzer may have been involved with the fixing or attempted fixing of nine matches in total .
according to reports at the time , further investigation into hoyzer uncovered that he was paid bribes totaling 67,000 euros and was given a flat-screen television . he was arrested in february and spent two weeks in custody .
during his time in incarceration , hoyzer co-operated with berlin prosecutors and the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , who later banned him for life .
he faces 11 charges at trial , including complicity to defraud . official and shamed player face rigging charges as well as hoyer , referee dominik marks and former top flight player steffen karl are charged with involvement in the rigging of matches between april and december last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominik marks maintains his innocence marks has been accused of fixing two matches by hoyzer , one in the second division and the other in the regional northern league .
he was arrested in march 9 and spent four weeks in custody under suspicion of match-fixing .
despite maintaining his innocence , marks faces five charges . karl , a former defensive midfielder for borussia dortmund and hertha berlin , is accused of throwing games for financial gain and faces five charges . all three are accused of involvement under the orders of three croatian brothers who betted on the results .

the 40-year old eldest brother milan faces 11 charges of betting on rigged matches while 37-year old filip , who has apparently co-operated with investigators , faces four similar charges . the defendants will be required to enter a plea at the beginning of the trial with all – except marks – expected to plead guilty .
the offences could bring jail terms of up to 10 years , although lawyers from the defense counsel hope that the confessions and a lack of previous convictions will lead to sentences nearer the one year minimum . investigation uncovers widespread corruption in total , berlin prosecutors have investigated 25 people in connection with the scandal , many of whom are suspected of having been involved in manipulating at least 10 matches in 2004 .
there have also been 14 players investigated , from second division clubs energie cottbus , dynamo dresden and regional sides chemnitzer fc , kickers offenbach and sc paderborn . prosecutors have also seized 2.44 million euros in bank accounts and of assets belonging to the three sapina brothers during february raids . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a shadow over german soccer german soccer has struggled recently .

" we are only talking about material damage , " kaczynski , who is warsaw 's present-day mayor , told reporters at a briefing . although kaczynski , who is trailing liberal candidate donald tusk in the race for the presidency , which goes to a second round on sunday , denied he was using the lingering animosity between poland and germany to try to win votes , political analyst stanislaw mocek read the opposite into his tactic . " it is surely no fluke that he presented this report today .
it is clearly a new element of his campaign , " said mocek of the polish academy of sciences . " kaczynski is trying to win over older voters who still vividly remember the war .
to the young , the past does n't mean much , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk , presidential candidate from the civic platform party " he is also trying to win votes in the west of the country , in regions that were german before the war , " said mocek .
tusk scored a clear win in the west in the first round of the vote . " not linked in any way " but kaczynski insisted the report was not tied to the election . " work on this report was begun in may 2004 ; it is not linked in any way whatsoever to the electoral calendar , " he told journalists , before recalling his suspicion of poland 's large neighbour to the west , germany , and stressing that poland " needs a president who speaks out decisively , not a president who is open to compromise , as the german press presents donald tusk . " the report , nearly 700 pages long and entitled " warsaw 's losses between 1939 and 1945 , " was commissioned in response to announcements that germans who were expelled from areas in western poland at the end of the war intended to seek compensation for property they had to leave behind . " if germany insists on rewriting history , if there are more demands for compensation ... we have a weapon to defend ourselves with this report , " kaczynski said . " there was no other city in occupied europe which lost more than half its inhabitants and was more than 80 percent destroyed , as was warsaw , " he said . " the germans can not be allowed to present themselves as the second victims of world war two after the jews . " strategy already used fanning the abiding distrust of germany has already been used in the election campaign . last week , kaczynski 's election team accused tusk 's grandfather of fighting in the german army in world war ii , an accusation tusk said " overstepped the bounds of decency " - and which cost kaczynski 's campaign chief jacek kurski his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi troops march into poland in 1939 world war two started with the german invasion of poland , and accusations of collaborating with the nazis during the war still hit home , more than half a century later . " kaczynski always puts himself forward as the only good guy , " said mocek . but neither his accusations about tusk 's grandfather being in the wehrmacht , nor the report on nazi destruction in warsaw , appeared to have done the conservative presidential candidate much good . five days before the second round , opinion polls put tusk in the lead with around 58 percent of the vote , with kaczynski about 15 points behind him . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , warsaw head for cool spell strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .

" we are only talking about material damage , " kaczynski , who is warsaw 's present-day mayor , told reporters at a briefing . although kaczynski , who is trailing liberal candidate donald tusk in the race for the presidency , which goes to a second round on sunday , denied he was using the lingering animosity between poland and germany to try to win votes , political analyst stanislaw mocek read the opposite into his tactic . " it is surely no fluke that he presented this report today .

tusk scored a clear win in the west in the first round of the vote . " not linked in any way " but kaczynski insisted the report was not tied to the election . " work on this report was begun in may 2004 ; it is not linked in any way whatsoever to the electoral calendar , " he told journalists , before recalling his suspicion of poland 's large neighbour to the west , germany , and stressing that poland " needs a president who speaks out decisively , not a president who is open to compromise , as the german press presents donald tusk . " the report , nearly 700 pages long and entitled " warsaw 's losses between 1939 and 1945 , " was commissioned in response to announcements that germans who were expelled from areas in western poland at the end of the war intended to seek compensation for property they had to leave behind . " if germany insists on rewriting history , if there are more demands for compensation ... we have a weapon to defend ourselves with this report , " kaczynski said . " there was no other city in occupied europe which lost more than half its inhabitants and was more than 80 percent destroyed , as was warsaw , " he said . " the germans can not be allowed to present themselves as the second victims of world war two after the jews . " strategy already used fanning the abiding distrust of germany has already been used in the election campaign . last week , kaczynski 's election team accused tusk 's grandfather of fighting in the german army in world war ii , an accusation tusk said " overstepped the bounds of decency " - and which cost kaczynski 's campaign chief jacek kurski his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi troops march into poland in 1939 world war two started with the german invasion of poland , and accusations of collaborating with the nazis during the war still hit home , more than half a century later . " kaczynski always puts himself forward as the only good guy , " said mocek . but neither his accusations about tusk 's grandfather being in the wehrmacht , nor the report on nazi destruction in warsaw , appeared to have done the conservative presidential candidate much good . five days before the second round , opinion polls put tusk in the lead with around 58 percent of the vote , with kaczynski about 15 points behind him . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , warsaw head for cool spell strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .

a controversial figure , schäuble returns to the position which he held under former chancellor helmut kohl . wolfgang schäuble is considered by many to be the most experienced member of chancellor-designate angela merkel 's new coalition government . schäuble , 63 , made his career in the ample shadow of former chancellor kohl when he was considered the chancellor 's closest confidant . merkel 's conservatives named the respected cdu veteran to head the interior ministry , a position he also held from 1989-1991 . schäubles rise to the top wolfgang schäuble is a protestant who was born in freiburg in 1942 . a trained lawyer by profession , he has served as an elected official for over 35 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble survived an assasination attempt by a mentally ill man in 1990 .
confined to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 that left him paralyzed him from the waist down , schäuble is considered one of the architects of german reunification . he served as interior minister in the kohl government and was chief whip of the cdu , building a reputation as a cross-party deal-maker in germany 's complex system of federal government .
during the kohl years he came to be regarded as the chancellor 's political confidante and in return for his loyalty was the only candidate allowed to rise to a position of influence within the party .

schäuble declared that this donation had not been published in the party 's official records .

he suffered a setback in 2004 when merkel refused to back him for the role of federal president , preferring the cdu 's former head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , for the job .

" we are only talking about material damage , " kaczynski , who is warsaw 's present-day mayor , told reporters at a briefing . although kaczynski , who is trailing liberal candidate donald tusk in the race for the presidency , which goes to a second round on sunday , denied he was using the lingering animosity between poland and germany to try to win votes , political analyst stanislaw mocek read the opposite into his tactic . " it is surely no fluke that he presented this report today .
it is clearly a new element of his campaign , " said mocek of the polish academy of sciences . " kaczynski is trying to win over older voters who still vividly remember the war .
to the young , the past does n't mean much , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk , presidential candidate from the civic platform party " he is also trying to win votes in the west of the country , in regions that were german before the war , " said mocek .
tusk scored a clear win in the west in the first round of the vote . " not linked in any way " but kaczynski insisted the report was not tied to the election . " work on this report was begun in may 2004 ; it is not linked in any way whatsoever to the electoral calendar , " he told journalists , before recalling his suspicion of poland 's large neighbour to the west , germany , and stressing that poland " needs a president who speaks out decisively , not a president who is open to compromise , as the german press presents donald tusk . " the report , nearly 700 pages long and entitled " warsaw 's losses between 1939 and 1945 , " was commissioned in response to announcements that germans who were expelled from areas in western poland at the end of the war intended to seek compensation for property they had to leave behind . " if germany insists on rewriting history , if there are more demands for compensation ... we have a weapon to defend ourselves with this report , " kaczynski said . " there was no other city in occupied europe which lost more than half its inhabitants and was more than 80 percent destroyed , as was warsaw , " he said . " the germans can not be allowed to present themselves as the second victims of world war two after the jews . " strategy already used fanning the abiding distrust of germany has already been used in the election campaign . last week , kaczynski 's election team accused tusk 's grandfather of fighting in the german army in world war ii , an accusation tusk said " overstepped the bounds of decency " - and which cost kaczynski 's campaign chief jacek kurski his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi troops march into poland in 1939 world war two started with the german invasion of poland , and accusations of collaborating with the nazis during the war still hit home , more than half a century later . " kaczynski always puts himself forward as the only good guy , " said mocek . but neither his accusations about tusk 's grandfather being in the wehrmacht , nor the report on nazi destruction in warsaw , appeared to have done the conservative presidential candidate much good . five days before the second round , opinion polls put tusk in the lead with around 58 percent of the vote , with kaczynski about 15 points behind him . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , warsaw head for cool spell strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .

some subsidy backers say brussels is keeping them in the dark . first came the proposal to reduce agricultural subsidies ; then came the backlash . peter mandelson , the eu trade commissioner , called for reducing subsidies under the bloc 's common agricultural policy by 70 percent and farm import duties by 60 percent after 2013 . then france , along with a dozen other members , called an emergency meeting tuesday to tie his hands .
they accused him of exceeding his mandate , offering too many concessions in negotiations , and want him restricted before he goes to hong kong in december . france 's main farm union , fnsea , accused mandelson of " sacrificing european agriculture on the altar of economic and social deregulation , " saying thousands of jobs were threatened . not over yet mandelson has been pressuring member states to give him the negotiating power to allow him to reach a deal over farm subsidies , which he says would be to everyone 's benefit - both developing and industrial nations . trade experts say progress on cutting subsidies that developed nations pay to their farmers is crucial to agreeing on a global trade back at wto talks in hong kong in december , which could boost or hinder the world economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson wants his hands untied " the world trade talks are important for all of us , including many developing countries , " he told reporters .
" so it is very important that we are allowed to go forwards and not backwards .

" with these negotiations you have the opportunity to win a double dividend , " he said , because european farmers could benefit from agricultural reforms within the european union and from trade reforms by other members of the wto , which could give european manufacturers more access to fast-growing markets like brazil and india . lamy added that the united states had accepted the principle of reducing their agricultural subsidies and that the eu had to demonstrate " greater flexibility " in return .
the us has said europe needs to go further with agricultural subsidy reform . but anxieties within the farming community that the eu commission might go too far in reducing support for its farmers were backed by the president of the agricultural commission in the european parliament , joseph daul . daul said that he had " the painful feeling that the eu is capitulating at the wto .

they accused him of exceeding his mandate , offering too many concessions in negotiations , and want him restricted before he goes to hong kong in december . france 's main farm union , fnsea , accused mandelson of " sacrificing european agriculture on the altar of economic and social deregulation , " saying thousands of jobs were threatened . not over yet mandelson has been pressuring member states to give him the negotiating power to allow him to reach a deal over farm subsidies , which he says would be to everyone 's benefit - both developing and industrial nations . trade experts say progress on cutting subsidies that developed nations pay to their farmers is crucial to agreeing on a global trade back at wto talks in hong kong in december , which could boost or hinder the world economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson wants his hands untied " the world trade talks are important for all of us , including many developing countries , " he told reporters .
" so it is very important that we are allowed to go forwards and not backwards . " eleven of the union 's 25 members , including britain , support easing subsidies and tariffs during wto negotiations . mandelson has said that his initiative to lower subsidies does not exceed his mandate and denies that he is british prime minister tony blair 's lackey .
blair and french president jacques chirac have fought frequently over eu farm subsidies , which total over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- a year and largely benefit the french . european farmers warn eu meanwhile , european farmers reiterated their demands tuesday that the european commission stay within its mandate , echoing the french government . jean-michel lemetayer , head of the french farmers ' group caf , said that the commission had to know " the limits not to go past , " particularly on the issue of opening up the european market to imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamy wants to see a deal addressing the meeting of 650 members of agriculture groups from across europe , the director-general of the wto , pascal lamy , tried to reassuring those present . " my conviction is that european farmers have no reason to be on the defensive , " lamy said .
" with these negotiations you have the opportunity to win a double dividend , " he said , because european farmers could benefit from agricultural reforms within the european union and from trade reforms by other members of the wto , which could give european manufacturers more access to fast-growing markets like brazil and india . lamy added that the united states had accepted the principle of reducing their agricultural subsidies and that the eu had to demonstrate " greater flexibility " in return .
the us has said europe needs to go further with agricultural subsidy reform . but anxieties within the farming community that the eu commission might go too far in reducing support for its farmers were backed by the president of the agricultural commission in the european parliament , joseph daul . daul said that he had " the painful feeling that the eu is capitulating at the wto .

at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .
they want to know about the things that affect them directly .
which taxes will be raised or lowered ?
will their pensions rise or fall ?
will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?
will driving on the country 's freeways remain free of charge ? all of these questions will be addressed in the coming four weeks of coalition negotiations .
in this respect , the last month , while high drama for journalists , was wasted time in the eyes of most citizens . people are interested in results , even the kind of results that they suspect will be painful .
at the same time , that 's exactly what they are afraid of .
of course people know that five million unemployed will , over time , prove the ruin of the welfare state .
they 're aware that the public coffers are already in critical condition .
but they are very afraid of the actions that need to be taken to solve these problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans voted for reform , but not too much of it it is because the union parties prescribed bitter medicine to address germany 's ills during their election campaign that they did so poorly on election day .
and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .
the remaining tasks at hand could then be tackled by the next government , whatever its composition may be . felix steiner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .
they want to know about the things that affect them directly .
which taxes will be raised or lowered ?
will their pensions rise or fall ?
will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?
will driving on the country 's freeways remain free of charge ? all of these questions will be addressed in the coming four weeks of coalition negotiations .
in this respect , the last month , while high drama for journalists , was wasted time in the eyes of most citizens . people are interested in results , even the kind of results that they suspect will be painful .
at the same time , that 's exactly what they are afraid of .
of course people know that five million unemployed will , over time , prove the ruin of the welfare state .
they 're aware that the public coffers are already in critical condition .
but they are very afraid of the actions that need to be taken to solve these problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans voted for reform , but not too much of it it is because the union parties prescribed bitter medicine to address germany 's ills during their election campaign that they did so poorly on election day .
and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .
the remaining tasks at hand could then be tackled by the next government , whatever its composition may be . felix steiner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.10.2005 new german parliament sits for first time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the direction the new parliament will take is unclear germany 's new parliament sat for the first time on tuesday even as the incoming coalition government tries to put together a policy program . exactly one month after dramatic elections threw germany into political chaos , the 614 newly elected lawmakers met in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament . the sitting , which had to take place within 30 days of the election , marked the official end of chancellor gerhard schröder 's seven years in power , although he and his cabinet will continue to take care of state business until his successor , the leader of the conservative christian democrats , angela merkel , is in place . merkel completed her cabinet line-up on monday , naming conservative ministers , including one of her fiercest political rivals , horst seehofer , to ministerial posts . the cabinet of christian democrats and social democrats has begun four weeks of complex negotiations to hammer out a joint government program .
the bundestag is expected to sit in mid-november to formally elect merkel as chancellor . " we must take this criticism seriously " the oldest member of the bundestag , interior minster otto schilly officially opened the session .
afterwards , norbert lammert , a christian democrat who has been a member of parliament for 25 years , was elected its new speaker , replacing social democrat wolfgang thierse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new speaker , nobert lammert -lrb- left -rrb- , with angela merkel " neither germany ’ s parties and parliament nor the government and opposition are currently highly regarded by the german public , " said lammert .
" we must take this criticism seriously , because the huge challenges our country is facing can only be tackled if germans regain trust in their political institutions . " merkel 's christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , have 226 seats in the lower house , just four more than schröder 's social democrats .
despite having given up his ambitions of serving a third term as chancellor , schröder retains a seat in the bundestag . attack on all fronts the rest of the parliament is made up by the free democrats with 61 seats , the 54 lawmakers of the left party - a mix of former communists and disgruntled social democrats - and the former governing coalition partners , the greens , who have 51 seats . germany ’ s new left party already vowed to attack the new government , especially on its social policies .
the party unites former east german communists with former leftwing spd members who were critical of gerhard schröder ’ s economic and welfare reforms , which they described as unfair to the poor .
the environmentalist greens are convinced that neither the government nor the two other opposition parties are sufficiently committed to environmentally sound policies . problems at home ? meanwhile , the german press on tuesday predicted problems ahead for merkel from her own camp following the nomination of seehofer to the agriculture ministry . known for his stance on the left wing of the conservatives , seehofer has clashed with merkel over her proposals to reform the health service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trouble from within - edmund stoiber and merkel have their differences edmund stoiber , the head of the csu and the new economy minister , insisted on seehofer 's nomination to government in exchange for his support . " stoiber could not have brought a stronger merkel opponent into the cabinet , " commented the left-wing tageszeitung daily . other newspapers said seehofer was likely to side with the eight social democrat ministers in the government in opposing large-scale reforms . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de federal reform : a critical first step now that angela merkel 's cabinet has been named , it 's time for the hard work to begin .
at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform .

on tuesday , the specter of match-fixing and corruption in german soccer rears its ugly head once again when the disgraced bundesliga referee robert hoyzer and five others come to court to face fraud charges . hoyzer and his alleged cohorts are at the center of germany ’ s biggest sporting embarrassment ; a scandal involving crooked match officials , greedy and corrupt players and a network of gangsters which stretched from germany to turkey and beyond . the affair tells the story of games thrown for money , a widespread illegal betting cartel and the threats and intimidation that went with instigating a match-rigging operation which threatened to undermine the very structure of soccer in germany . trial likely to coincide with world cup draw tuesday 's opening session in berlin 's superior court will reopen wounds inflicted on the game that have barely had time to scab over .
and with the world cup due to kick off in less than nine months , german soccer authorities are hoping that the trial is concluded swiftly .

some subsidy backers say brussels is keeping them in the dark . first came the proposal to reduce agricultural subsidies ; then came the backlash . peter mandelson , the eu trade commissioner , called for reducing subsidies under the bloc 's common agricultural policy by 70 percent and farm import duties by 60 percent after 2013 . then france , along with a dozen other members , called an emergency meeting tuesday to tie his hands .
they accused him of exceeding his mandate , offering too many concessions in negotiations , and want him restricted before he goes to hong kong in december . france 's main farm union , fnsea , accused mandelson of " sacrificing european agriculture on the altar of economic and social deregulation , " saying thousands of jobs were threatened . not over yet mandelson has been pressuring member states to give him the negotiating power to allow him to reach a deal over farm subsidies , which he says would be to everyone 's benefit - both developing and industrial nations . trade experts say progress on cutting subsidies that developed nations pay to their farmers is crucial to agreeing on a global trade back at wto talks in hong kong in december , which could boost or hinder the world economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson wants his hands untied " the world trade talks are important for all of us , including many developing countries , " he told reporters .
" so it is very important that we are allowed to go forwards and not backwards . " eleven of the union 's 25 members , including britain , support easing subsidies and tariffs during wto negotiations . mandelson has said that his initiative to lower subsidies does not exceed his mandate and denies that he is british prime minister tony blair 's lackey .
blair and french president jacques chirac have fought frequently over eu farm subsidies , which total over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- a year and largely benefit the french . european farmers warn eu meanwhile , european farmers reiterated their demands tuesday that the european commission stay within its mandate , echoing the french government . jean-michel lemetayer , head of the french farmers ' group caf , said that the commission had to know " the limits not to go past , " particularly on the issue of opening up the european market to imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamy wants to see a deal addressing the meeting of 650 members of agriculture groups from across europe , the director-general of the wto , pascal lamy , tried to reassuring those present . " my conviction is that european farmers have no reason to be on the defensive , " lamy said .
" with these negotiations you have the opportunity to win a double dividend , " he said , because european farmers could benefit from agricultural reforms within the european union and from trade reforms by other members of the wto , which could give european manufacturers more access to fast-growing markets like brazil and india . lamy added that the united states had accepted the principle of reducing their agricultural subsidies and that the eu had to demonstrate " greater flexibility " in return .
the us has said europe needs to go further with agricultural subsidy reform . but anxieties within the farming community that the eu commission might go too far in reducing support for its farmers were backed by the president of the agricultural commission in the european parliament , joseph daul . daul said that he had " the painful feeling that the eu is capitulating at the wto .

a controversial figure , schäuble returns to the position which he held under former chancellor helmut kohl . wolfgang schäuble is considered by many to be the most experienced member of chancellor-designate angela merkel 's new coalition government . schäuble , 63 , made his career in the ample shadow of former chancellor kohl when he was considered the chancellor 's closest confidant . merkel 's conservatives named the respected cdu veteran to head the interior ministry , a position he also held from 1989-1991 . schäubles rise to the top wolfgang schäuble is a protestant who was born in freiburg in 1942 . a trained lawyer by profession , he has served as an elected official for over 35 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble survived an assasination attempt by a mentally ill man in 1990 .
confined to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 that left him paralyzed him from the waist down , schäuble is considered one of the architects of german reunification . he served as interior minister in the kohl government and was chief whip of the cdu , building a reputation as a cross-party deal-maker in germany 's complex system of federal government .
during the kohl years he came to be regarded as the chancellor 's political confidante and in return for his loyalty was the only candidate allowed to rise to a position of influence within the party .
when mr kohl finally stepped down , following the cdu 's 1998 election defeat mr schäuble , inherited the leadership of the cdu .
finance scandal damages cdu just over a year after being voted out of office , helmut kohl admitted in a tv interview that the cdu had received approximately two million deutsche marks in secret donations between 1993 and 1998 .
these donations , which were not published in the party 's annual finance reports , were then funnelled back into the coffers of regional and local cdu party branches , to cover campaign costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble was considered by many to be helmut kohls right hand man when the allegations first emerged in 1999 , schäuble promised quick party-wide investigations and acted carefully to minimize political damage to his predecessor and one-time mentor . however by the beginning of 2000 it was clear that the cdu 's funding scandal engulf him as well . schäuble admitted on january 10 , 2000 , that he had received a cash donation of 100,000 dm from karlheinz schreiber , a bavarian businessman and arms dealer .
schäuble declared that this donation had not been published in the party 's official records .
he blamed brigitte baumeister , the former party treasurer , for this " mistake " and denies any personal wrong-doing . reluctant bedfellows ? chancellor-designate merkel took over the leadership of the cdu from schäuble in 2000 . but despite severe criticism from both within and outside of his party schäuble eventually salvaged his reputation and became one of germany 's most respected politicians .
he suffered a setback in 2004 when merkel refused to back him for the role of federal president , preferring the cdu 's former head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , for the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble congratulates angela merkel in 1998 after she was elected as cdu general secretary relations between merkel and schäuble have improved over the years but he is not regarded as a close ally .
still , many observers say merkel is turning to him now because she knows his political know-how will be essential if a potentially fractious government is to work . merkel has a history of sidelining party rivals and that has left her with few experienced conservative allies for top posts .
her party 's unexpectedly poor result in a sept .
18 election likewise curbed her ability to dictate who will be in her team .
as for his role as the country 's top security official , schäuble is likely to take just as tough a line on law and order as his social democrat predecessor otto schily . dw staff -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel announces german cabinet after playing tug-of-war with her own party , germany 's chancellor-designate , angela merkel , named her cabinet members on monday , ahead of coalition talks aimed at forming the new government .

" we are only talking about material damage , " kaczynski , who is warsaw 's present-day mayor , told reporters at a briefing . although kaczynski , who is trailing liberal candidate donald tusk in the race for the presidency , which goes to a second round on sunday , denied he was using the lingering animosity between poland and germany to try to win votes , political analyst stanislaw mocek read the opposite into his tactic . " it is surely no fluke that he presented this report today .
it is clearly a new element of his campaign , " said mocek of the polish academy of sciences . " kaczynski is trying to win over older voters who still vividly remember the war .
to the young , the past does n't mean much , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk , presidential candidate from the civic platform party " he is also trying to win votes in the west of the country , in regions that were german before the war , " said mocek .
tusk scored a clear win in the west in the first round of the vote . " not linked in any way " but kaczynski insisted the report was not tied to the election . " work on this report was begun in may 2004 ; it is not linked in any way whatsoever to the electoral calendar , " he told journalists , before recalling his suspicion of poland 's large neighbour to the west , germany , and stressing that poland " needs a president who speaks out decisively , not a president who is open to compromise , as the german press presents donald tusk . " the report , nearly 700 pages long and entitled " warsaw 's losses between 1939 and 1945 , " was commissioned in response to announcements that germans who were expelled from areas in western poland at the end of the war intended to seek compensation for property they had to leave behind . " if germany insists on rewriting history , if there are more demands for compensation ... we have a weapon to defend ourselves with this report , " kaczynski said . " there was no other city in occupied europe which lost more than half its inhabitants and was more than 80 percent destroyed , as was warsaw , " he said . " the germans can not be allowed to present themselves as the second victims of world war two after the jews . " strategy already used fanning the abiding distrust of germany has already been used in the election campaign . last week , kaczynski 's election team accused tusk 's grandfather of fighting in the german army in world war ii , an accusation tusk said " overstepped the bounds of decency " - and which cost kaczynski 's campaign chief jacek kurski his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi troops march into poland in 1939 world war two started with the german invasion of poland , and accusations of collaborating with the nazis during the war still hit home , more than half a century later . " kaczynski always puts himself forward as the only good guy , " said mocek . but neither his accusations about tusk 's grandfather being in the wehrmacht , nor the report on nazi destruction in warsaw , appeared to have done the conservative presidential candidate much good . five days before the second round , opinion polls put tusk in the lead with around 58 percent of the vote , with kaczynski about 15 points behind him . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , warsaw head for cool spell strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .

" we are only talking about material damage , " kaczynski , who is warsaw 's present-day mayor , told reporters at a briefing . although kaczynski , who is trailing liberal candidate donald tusk in the race for the presidency , which goes to a second round on sunday , denied he was using the lingering animosity between poland and germany to try to win votes , political analyst stanislaw mocek read the opposite into his tactic . " it is surely no fluke that he presented this report today .
it is clearly a new element of his campaign , " said mocek of the polish academy of sciences . " kaczynski is trying to win over older voters who still vividly remember the war .
to the young , the past does n't mean much , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk , presidential candidate from the civic platform party " he is also trying to win votes in the west of the country , in regions that were german before the war , " said mocek .
tusk scored a clear win in the west in the first round of the vote . " not linked in any way " but kaczynski insisted the report was not tied to the election . " work on this report was begun in may 2004 ; it is not linked in any way whatsoever to the electoral calendar , " he told journalists , before recalling his suspicion of poland 's large neighbour to the west , germany , and stressing that poland " needs a president who speaks out decisively , not a president who is open to compromise , as the german press presents donald tusk . " the report , nearly 700 pages long and entitled " warsaw 's losses between 1939 and 1945 , " was commissioned in response to announcements that germans who were expelled from areas in western poland at the end of the war intended to seek compensation for property they had to leave behind . " if germany insists on rewriting history , if there are more demands for compensation ... we have a weapon to defend ourselves with this report , " kaczynski said . " there was no other city in occupied europe which lost more than half its inhabitants and was more than 80 percent destroyed , as was warsaw , " he said . " the germans can not be allowed to present themselves as the second victims of world war two after the jews . " strategy already used fanning the abiding distrust of germany has already been used in the election campaign . last week , kaczynski 's election team accused tusk 's grandfather of fighting in the german army in world war ii , an accusation tusk said " overstepped the bounds of decency " - and which cost kaczynski 's campaign chief jacek kurski his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi troops march into poland in 1939 world war two started with the german invasion of poland , and accusations of collaborating with the nazis during the war still hit home , more than half a century later . " kaczynski always puts himself forward as the only good guy , " said mocek . but neither his accusations about tusk 's grandfather being in the wehrmacht , nor the report on nazi destruction in warsaw , appeared to have done the conservative presidential candidate much good . five days before the second round , opinion polls put tusk in the lead with around 58 percent of the vote , with kaczynski about 15 points behind him . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , warsaw head for cool spell strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.10.2005 spain , france join forces on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are prepared to go to any length to enter the eu spain and france have announced that they will propose a joint plan for a european-african conference on immigration at a european union summit later this month . the plan will be supported at the meeting by the french who gave their public backing to the proposal which will be presented at the summit in britain on oct .
27 and 28 . " france supports the spanish idea of a european-african conference on immigration , " french prime minister dominique de villepin said on monday after holding discussions with his spanish counterpart jose luis rodriguez zapatero in barcelona . " all of our countries are confronted today with this question of immigration .
we should treat it with courage , daring and imagination , " de villepin added . " spain and france will present a joint initiative at the next european council on a global plan on a response to immigration ... which commits the eu much more than it has been up to now , " prime minister zapatero told the press conference . the issue came to a head last month with a series of assaults by thousands of sub-saharan african immigrants on fencing at the spanish border surrounding the north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla - africa 's only land border with the eu . deaths and mayhem at spain 's african border at least 14 people have died in their attempt to leap over the heavily defended borders after trekking across vast swathes of africa to northern morocco .
some of them have been shot by moroccan security forces while desperately attempting to reach a better life in europe . bildunterschrift : african immigrants in a transit camp near spain after struggling for some time to keep the waves of immigrants from swamping its borders , spain has repeatedly called on the eu to get a grip on the roots of the illegal immigration problem by aiding the poor african countries from where migrants originate .
the reasoning behind this policy being that if better opportunities existed at home , there would be less reason for migrants to risk their lives in attempting to reach the wealthy eu . zapatero told his french counterpart that illegal immigration from sub-saharan africa was an issue that concerned the whole of africa and europe and one that morocco and spain could not deal with alone . zapatero calls on eu to avert " humanitarian drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero spoke to chirac about the immigration issue .
" europe refuses to take the african immigrants , but spain and morocco can not play the role of eu policeman on their own , " a spanish spokesman told afp on behalf of the prime minister , adding it was " time to act " to solve a " humanitarian drama . "
zapatero himself revealed that he had spoken directly by phone with french president jacques chirac about the issue . as well as storming the borders around ceuta and melilla , thousands more african migrants take to rickety boats each year in a perilous trip to the canary islands or across the gibraltar strait to southern spain .
many don ’ t make it across alive . french pm sketches out two-pronged strategy while zapatero provided no details of the proposal , de villepin hinted at a two-pronged strategy which would combine improving controls along the border regions with a development and training program in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin .
the french prime minister added that transit countries for immigrants should also be given support in protecting their borders under a new , broad european immigration policy . spain annoyed some of its eu partners earlier this year by giving documentation to hundreds of thousands of immigrants who had been working illegally in spain and then had irritated them further recently by allowing “ thousands ” more to enter spain .. neighbors " irritated " by spanish policy the spanish daily abc reported that the french and german interior ministers had complained " this week " about spain 's immigration policy , saying " 25,000 illegals from black africa have crossed the pyrenees in the past few months " to france , belgium and the netherlands . quoting police experts , abc said another 25,000 were still in spain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily the paper added that french interior minister nicolas sarkozy had called the spanish government the " sorcerer 's apprentice " in terms of immigration and called the country “ an open door ” while the paper quoted german counterpart otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- as saying that " massive -lrb- immigrant -rrb- regularization has the knock-on effect of attracting new illegals .

27 and 28 . " france supports the spanish idea of a european-african conference on immigration , " french prime minister dominique de villepin said on monday after holding discussions with his spanish counterpart jose luis rodriguez zapatero in barcelona . " all of our countries are confronted today with this question of immigration .
we should treat it with courage , daring and imagination , " de villepin added . " spain and france will present a joint initiative at the next european council on a global plan on a response to immigration ... which commits the eu much more than it has been up to now , " prime minister zapatero told the press conference . the issue came to a head last month with a series of assaults by thousands of sub-saharan african immigrants on fencing at the spanish border surrounding the north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla - africa 's only land border with the eu . deaths and mayhem at spain 's african border at least 14 people have died in their attempt to leap over the heavily defended borders after trekking across vast swathes of africa to northern morocco .
some of them have been shot by moroccan security forces while desperately attempting to reach a better life in europe . bildunterschrift : african immigrants in a transit camp near spain after struggling for some time to keep the waves of immigrants from swamping its borders , spain has repeatedly called on the eu to get a grip on the roots of the illegal immigration problem by aiding the poor african countries from where migrants originate .
the reasoning behind this policy being that if better opportunities existed at home , there would be less reason for migrants to risk their lives in attempting to reach the wealthy eu . zapatero told his french counterpart that illegal immigration from sub-saharan africa was an issue that concerned the whole of africa and europe and one that morocco and spain could not deal with alone . zapatero calls on eu to avert " humanitarian drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero spoke to chirac about the immigration issue .
" europe refuses to take the african immigrants , but spain and morocco can not play the role of eu policeman on their own , " a spanish spokesman told afp on behalf of the prime minister , adding it was " time to act " to solve a " humanitarian drama . "
zapatero himself revealed that he had spoken directly by phone with french president jacques chirac about the issue . as well as storming the borders around ceuta and melilla , thousands more african migrants take to rickety boats each year in a perilous trip to the canary islands or across the gibraltar strait to southern spain .
many don ’ t make it across alive . french pm sketches out two-pronged strategy while zapatero provided no details of the proposal , de villepin hinted at a two-pronged strategy which would combine improving controls along the border regions with a development and training program in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin .
the french prime minister added that transit countries for immigrants should also be given support in protecting their borders under a new , broad european immigration policy . spain annoyed some of its eu partners earlier this year by giving documentation to hundreds of thousands of immigrants who had been working illegally in spain and then had irritated them further recently by allowing “ thousands ” more to enter spain .. neighbors " irritated " by spanish policy the spanish daily abc reported that the french and german interior ministers had complained " this week " about spain 's immigration policy , saying " 25,000 illegals from black africa have crossed the pyrenees in the past few months " to france , belgium and the netherlands . quoting police experts , abc said another 25,000 were still in spain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily the paper added that french interior minister nicolas sarkozy had called the spanish government the " sorcerer 's apprentice " in terms of immigration and called the country “ an open door ” while the paper quoted german counterpart otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- as saying that " massive -lrb- immigrant -rrb- regularization has the knock-on effect of attracting new illegals .

" we are only talking about material damage , " kaczynski , who is warsaw 's present-day mayor , told reporters at a briefing . although kaczynski , who is trailing liberal candidate donald tusk in the race for the presidency , which goes to a second round on sunday , denied he was using the lingering animosity between poland and germany to try to win votes , political analyst stanislaw mocek read the opposite into his tactic .

" if germany insists on rewriting history , if there are more demands for compensation ... we have a weapon to defend ourselves with this report , " kaczynski said . " there was no other city in occupied europe which lost more than half its inhabitants and was more than 80 percent destroyed , as was warsaw , " he said .

some are not surprised . this year , germany ranked the 16th cleanest country out of 159 surveyed , according to transparency international 's corruption perception index 2005 , slipping from its 15th place finish last year .

some are not surprised . this year , germany ranked the 16th cleanest country out of 159 surveyed , according to transparency international 's corruption perception index 2005 , slipping from its 15th place finish last year .
some officials are attributing the slide to recent scandals and to a lack of government anti-corruption measures .
" the frequency of corruption cases that we have had to deal with in the past months has taken some people by surprise , but not us . "
peter von blomberg with transparency deutschland , the local arm of the organization , told german news agency dpa . he referred to recent corruption scandals such as the one plaguing germany 's stock exchange and added that instead of tackling corruption problems themselves , representatives of the business community have been fighting the publication of corruption studies such as this latest one . iceland is cleanest the corruption survey reports that serious levels of corruption exist in two thirds of the 159 countries examined , and that there was a clear link between poverty and corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty breeds corruption , transparency says the report found that chad , bangladesh , turkmenistan and myanmar were perceived as the most corrupt countries in the world , while iceland was the cleanest .
most of the countries that landed at the bottom of the list were in africa , while those which came in at the top were industrialized asian and western countries . the nations perceived as the most corrupt also rank among the world 's poorest , which shows how corruption and poverty feed off each other , according to the report . " corruption is a major cause of poverty as well as a barrier to overcoming it , " locking poor countries in " a cycle of misery , " said transparency international chairman peter eigen .
" corruption must be vigorously addressed if aid is to make a real difference in freeing people from poverty . " severe corruption problem despite progress on many fronts , including the soon-to-be-implemented united nations convention against corruption , 70 countries scored less than three on the cpi , indicating a severe corruption problem , the report said . the cpi index score relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business people and country analysts and ranges between 10 , which is highly clean and zero , which is highly corrupt . for example , the united states was ranked 17th with a score of 7.6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says countries must do more against corruption iceland topped the list with a score of 9.7 , followed by finland -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , new zealand -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , denmark -lrb- 9.5 -rrb- , singapore -lrb- 9.4 -rrb- , sweden -lrb- 9.2 -rrb- , switzerland -lrb- 9.1 -rrb- norway -lrb- 8.9 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 8.8 -rrb- and austria -lrb- 8.7 -rrb- . ahead of germany 's score of 8.2 were the netherlands , britain , luxembourg , canada and hong kong .
france , belgium and ireland came in at 18th , 19th and 20th , respectively .
italy ranked 40th .
new eu countries such as poland fared worse , coming in at 70th place .
bottom of the list was chad -lrb- 1.7 -rrb- , followed by bangladesh -lrb- 1.7 -rrb- , turkmenistan -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- , myanmar -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- and haiti -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fighting global corruption from germany twelve years after he founded it , peter eigen is stepping down as chief of transparency international .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.10.2005 polish politician plays anti-german card großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's anti-german strategy has been meant to woo older voters conservative lech kaczynski played on poles ' lingering fears of germany to try to woo voters for the presidency when he presented a report on the devastation caused by the nazis in warsaw in world war ii . in today 's money , nazi germany caused at least 45.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in damage to the polish capital during the war , kaczynski , who is mayor of warsaw , said as he presented a report on the 1939 - 1945 nazi occupation . " we are only talking about material damage , " kaczynski , who is warsaw 's present-day mayor , told reporters at a briefing . although kaczynski , who is trailing liberal candidate donald tusk in the race for the presidency , which goes to a second round on sunday , denied he was using the lingering animosity between poland and germany to try to win votes , political analyst stanislaw mocek read the opposite into his tactic . " it is surely no fluke that he presented this report today .
it is clearly a new element of his campaign , " said mocek of the polish academy of sciences . " kaczynski is trying to win over older voters who still vividly remember the war .
to the young , the past does n't mean much , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk , presidential candidate from the civic platform party " he is also trying to win votes in the west of the country , in regions that were german before the war , " said mocek .
tusk scored a clear win in the west in the first round of the vote . " not linked in any way " but kaczynski insisted the report was not tied to the election . " work on this report was begun in may 2004 ; it is not linked in any way whatsoever to the electoral calendar , " he told journalists , before recalling his suspicion of poland 's large neighbour to the west , germany , and stressing that poland " needs a president who speaks out decisively , not a president who is open to compromise , as the german press presents donald tusk . " the report , nearly 700 pages long and entitled " warsaw 's losses between 1939 and 1945 , " was commissioned in response to announcements that germans who were expelled from areas in western poland at the end of the war intended to seek compensation for property they had to leave behind . " if germany insists on rewriting history , if there are more demands for compensation ... we have a weapon to defend ourselves with this report , " kaczynski said . " there was no other city in occupied europe which lost more than half its inhabitants and was more than 80 percent destroyed , as was warsaw , " he said . " the germans can not be allowed to present themselves as the second victims of world war two after the jews . " strategy already used fanning the abiding distrust of germany has already been used in the election campaign . last week , kaczynski 's election team accused tusk 's grandfather of fighting in the german army in world war ii , an accusation tusk said " overstepped the bounds of decency " - and which cost kaczynski 's campaign chief jacek kurski his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi troops march into poland in 1939 world war two started with the german invasion of poland , and accusations of collaborating with the nazis during the war still hit home , more than half a century later . " kaczynski always puts himself forward as the only good guy , " said mocek . but neither his accusations about tusk 's grandfather being in the wehrmacht , nor the report on nazi destruction in warsaw , appeared to have done the conservative presidential candidate much good . five days before the second round , opinion polls put tusk in the lead with around 58 percent of the vote , with kaczynski about 15 points behind him . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , warsaw head for cool spell strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .

27 and 28 . " france supports the spanish idea of a european-african conference on immigration , " french prime minister dominique de villepin said on monday after holding discussions with his spanish counterpart jose luis rodriguez zapatero in barcelona . " all of our countries are confronted today with this question of immigration .
we should treat it with courage , daring and imagination , " de villepin added . " spain and france will present a joint initiative at the next european council on a global plan on a response to immigration ... which commits the eu much more than it has been up to now , " prime minister zapatero told the press conference . the issue came to a head last month with a series of assaults by thousands of sub-saharan african immigrants on fencing at the spanish border surrounding the north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla - africa 's only land border with the eu . deaths and mayhem at spain 's african border at least 14 people have died in their attempt to leap over the heavily defended borders after trekking across vast swathes of africa to northern morocco .
some of them have been shot by moroccan security forces while desperately attempting to reach a better life in europe . bildunterschrift : african immigrants in a transit camp near spain after struggling for some time to keep the waves of immigrants from swamping its borders , spain has repeatedly called on the eu to get a grip on the roots of the illegal immigration problem by aiding the poor african countries from where migrants originate .
the reasoning behind this policy being that if better opportunities existed at home , there would be less reason for migrants to risk their lives in attempting to reach the wealthy eu . zapatero told his french counterpart that illegal immigration from sub-saharan africa was an issue that concerned the whole of africa and europe and one that morocco and spain could not deal with alone . zapatero calls on eu to avert " humanitarian drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero spoke to chirac about the immigration issue .
" europe refuses to take the african immigrants , but spain and morocco can not play the role of eu policeman on their own , " a spanish spokesman told afp on behalf of the prime minister , adding it was " time to act " to solve a " humanitarian drama . "
zapatero himself revealed that he had spoken directly by phone with french president jacques chirac about the issue . as well as storming the borders around ceuta and melilla , thousands more african migrants take to rickety boats each year in a perilous trip to the canary islands or across the gibraltar strait to southern spain .
many don ’ t make it across alive . french pm sketches out two-pronged strategy while zapatero provided no details of the proposal , de villepin hinted at a two-pronged strategy which would combine improving controls along the border regions with a development and training program in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin .
the french prime minister added that transit countries for immigrants should also be given support in protecting their borders under a new , broad european immigration policy . spain annoyed some of its eu partners earlier this year by giving documentation to hundreds of thousands of immigrants who had been working illegally in spain and then had irritated them further recently by allowing “ thousands ” more to enter spain .. neighbors " irritated " by spanish policy the spanish daily abc reported that the french and german interior ministers had complained " this week " about spain 's immigration policy , saying " 25,000 illegals from black africa have crossed the pyrenees in the past few months " to france , belgium and the netherlands . quoting police experts , abc said another 25,000 were still in spain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily the paper added that french interior minister nicolas sarkozy had called the spanish government the " sorcerer 's apprentice " in terms of immigration and called the country “ an open door ” while the paper quoted german counterpart otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- as saying that " massive -lrb- immigrant -rrb- regularization has the knock-on effect of attracting new illegals .

some are not surprised . this year , germany ranked the 16th cleanest country out of 159 surveyed , according to transparency international 's corruption perception index 2005 , slipping from its 15th place finish last year .
some officials are attributing the slide to recent scandals and to a lack of government anti-corruption measures .
" the frequency of corruption cases that we have had to deal with in the past months has taken some people by surprise , but not us . "
peter von blomberg with transparency deutschland , the local arm of the organization , told german news agency dpa . he referred to recent corruption scandals such as the one plaguing germany 's stock exchange and added that instead of tackling corruption problems themselves , representatives of the business community have been fighting the publication of corruption studies such as this latest one . iceland is cleanest the corruption survey reports that serious levels of corruption exist in two thirds of the 159 countries examined , and that there was a clear link between poverty and corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty breeds corruption , transparency says the report found that chad , bangladesh , turkmenistan and myanmar were perceived as the most corrupt countries in the world , while iceland was the cleanest .
most of the countries that landed at the bottom of the list were in africa , while those which came in at the top were industrialized asian and western countries . the nations perceived as the most corrupt also rank among the world 's poorest , which shows how corruption and poverty feed off each other , according to the report . " corruption is a major cause of poverty as well as a barrier to overcoming it , " locking poor countries in " a cycle of misery , " said transparency international chairman peter eigen .
" corruption must be vigorously addressed if aid is to make a real difference in freeing people from poverty . " severe corruption problem despite progress on many fronts , including the soon-to-be-implemented united nations convention against corruption , 70 countries scored less than three on the cpi , indicating a severe corruption problem , the report said . the cpi index score relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business people and country analysts and ranges between 10 , which is highly clean and zero , which is highly corrupt . for example , the united states was ranked 17th with a score of 7.6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says countries must do more against corruption iceland topped the list with a score of 9.7 , followed by finland -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , new zealand -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , denmark -lrb- 9.5 -rrb- , singapore -lrb- 9.4 -rrb- , sweden -lrb- 9.2 -rrb- , switzerland -lrb- 9.1 -rrb- norway -lrb- 8.9 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 8.8 -rrb- and austria -lrb- 8.7 -rrb- . ahead of germany 's score of 8.2 were the netherlands , britain , luxembourg , canada and hong kong .
france , belgium and ireland came in at 18th , 19th and 20th , respectively .
italy ranked 40th .
new eu countries such as poland fared worse , coming in at 70th place .

" we are only talking about material damage , " kaczynski , who is warsaw 's present-day mayor , told reporters at a briefing . although kaczynski , who is trailing liberal candidate donald tusk in the race for the presidency , which goes to a second round on sunday , denied he was using the lingering animosity between poland and germany to try to win votes , political analyst stanislaw mocek read the opposite into his tactic . " it is surely no fluke that he presented this report today .
it is clearly a new element of his campaign , " said mocek of the polish academy of sciences . " kaczynski is trying to win over older voters who still vividly remember the war .
to the young , the past does n't mean much , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk , presidential candidate from the civic platform party " he is also trying to win votes in the west of the country , in regions that were german before the war , " said mocek .
tusk scored a clear win in the west in the first round of the vote . " not linked in any way " but kaczynski insisted the report was not tied to the election . " work on this report was begun in may 2004 ; it is not linked in any way whatsoever to the electoral calendar , " he told journalists , before recalling his suspicion of poland 's large neighbour to the west , germany , and stressing that poland " needs a president who speaks out decisively , not a president who is open to compromise , as the german press presents donald tusk . " the report , nearly 700 pages long and entitled " warsaw 's losses between 1939 and 1945 , " was commissioned in response to announcements that germans who were expelled from areas in western poland at the end of the war intended to seek compensation for property they had to leave behind . " if germany insists on rewriting history , if there are more demands for compensation ... we have a weapon to defend ourselves with this report , " kaczynski said . " there was no other city in occupied europe which lost more than half its inhabitants and was more than 80 percent destroyed , as was warsaw , " he said . " the germans can not be allowed to present themselves as the second victims of world war two after the jews . " strategy already used fanning the abiding distrust of germany has already been used in the election campaign . last week , kaczynski 's election team accused tusk 's grandfather of fighting in the german army in world war ii , an accusation tusk said " overstepped the bounds of decency " - and which cost kaczynski 's campaign chief jacek kurski his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi troops march into poland in 1939 world war two started with the german invasion of poland , and accusations of collaborating with the nazis during the war still hit home , more than half a century later . " kaczynski always puts himself forward as the only good guy , " said mocek . but neither his accusations about tusk 's grandfather being in the wehrmacht , nor the report on nazi destruction in warsaw , appeared to have done the conservative presidential candidate much good . five days before the second round , opinion polls put tusk in the lead with around 58 percent of the vote , with kaczynski about 15 points behind him . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , warsaw head for cool spell strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .

fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds europe -pipe- 18.10.2005 bird flu confirmed in greece , fears mount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the risk of infected poultry is rising in europe concerns over the spread of bird flu in europe continued to grow after a related form of the h5n1 virus was discovered in greece as consumers across europe begin losing their appetite for chicken . the greek agriculture ministry said it had detected the h5 strain of the virus - of which the deadly h5n1 is a member - on the aegean islet of inoussess off the island of chios , just a few miles from turkey , which has also confirmed cases of bird flu . the greek authorities , which took nine samples from poultry on the islet last week found the presence of the h5 strain in a turkey , but have not yet confirmed whether it is the deadly strain . agriculture minister evangelos bassiakos said experts would need " seven or eight days " to carry out further tests to establish exactly what they are dealing with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is taking the threat of the virus seriously if confirmed as the h5n1 strain , which has already claimed 60 lives in asia , it would be the first case in the european union .
the infected turkey came from a small private poultry farm on the tiny island , and the authorities there have confirmed that they will cull all the other birds and medically examine the farmer 's family . the european union commission responded to the latest discovery by saying it would ban the export of live birds and bird related products from the chios area .
and the island 's prefect , polidoras lambrinoudis told the reuters news agency that no poultry or eggs were now allowed to leave the island . " risk to human health is conceivable , but minimal " so far , there have been no human cases of bird flu reported in europe , but the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has warned european nations not to divert funding and attention away from asia , which is the most likely breeding ground for the mutation of the virus into a form which is easily transmitted between humans . peter cordingly of the who says there is a lot of anxiety in europe which could mean that " governments might focus on domestic preparedness and forget the fact that ground zero is southeast asia . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of birds have been culled in southeast asia health experts say that the fight against bird flu is being hampered by huge differences in wealth between nations .
some countries have poor public health infrastructures and no stockpiles of the expensive anti-viral drugs which could help to limit a human pandemic . millions of birds in the region have already been culled in an attempt to stop the spread of the h5n1 strain , which first emerged in hong kong in 1997 . europe is keen to strike a balance between testing for outbreaks of the deadly bird flu and the need to play down the threat to the public . " the risk to human health , to public health , is minimal , " zsuzanna jakab , the director of the european centre for disease prevention and control -lrb- ecdc -rrb- told a news conference .
" it is conceivable , but minimal . " but who influenza program director klaus stoehr warns of the devastating consequences if the disease is not contained . " we do n't know whether a pandemic will break out in the coming weeks , months , or only in years .
but there 's no question that if such a pandemic occurs we 'll be looking at hundreds of thousands or even millions of deaths worldwide , " he said . chicken is off the menu consumers across europe are responding to the westward spread of bird flu by turning away from chicken and other poultry .
reassurances that cooking chicken at temperatures above 160 degrees fahrenheit destroys the virus have done little to allay fears , with farmers and supermarkets across much of the continent reporting a drop in sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers in southern europe are reportedly off poultry farmers in turkey say that poultry sales have fallen by 50 percent , and several restaurants have already removed white meat from their menus .
even france has reported a ten percent slíde in poultry deliveries , and one supermarket chain , systeme u , said sales had slumped by as much as 30 percent over the past few days . the trend was echoed in switzerland , italy and hungary , which shares a border with romania where cases of the deadly disease were discovered earlier this month . by contrast consumers in a number of northern european countries , including britain and denmark have not started to rethink their menus , and farming representatives in both belgium and the netherlands say there has been no noticeable change in poultry consumption . the german federation for the poultry industry , which represents 8,000 farms , stressed that german consumers had not lost their appetite for white meat . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks the growing threat of lethal bird flu spreading across europe will top the agendas of eu leaders this week , after the deadly asian strain of the virus landed on the continent for the first time .

at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .
they want to know about the things that affect them directly .
which taxes will be raised or lowered ?
will their pensions rise or fall ?
will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?
will driving on the country 's freeways remain free of charge ? all of these questions will be addressed in the coming four weeks of coalition negotiations .
in this respect , the last month , while high drama for journalists , was wasted time in the eyes of most citizens . people are interested in results , even the kind of results that they suspect will be painful .
at the same time , that 's exactly what they are afraid of .
of course people know that five million unemployed will , over time , prove the ruin of the welfare state .
they 're aware that the public coffers are already in critical condition .
but they are very afraid of the actions that need to be taken to solve these problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans voted for reform , but not too much of it it is because the union parties prescribed bitter medicine to address germany 's ills during their election campaign that they did so poorly on election day .
and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .
the remaining tasks at hand could then be tackled by the next government , whatever its composition may be . felix steiner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.10.2005 germany 's not so new interior minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble , sitting right , will bring experience to merkel 's new cabinet wolfgang schäuble , has been tapped to be germany 's new interior minister , replacing otto schily .
a controversial figure , schäuble returns to the position which he held under former chancellor helmut kohl . wolfgang schäuble is considered by many to be the most experienced member of chancellor-designate angela merkel 's new coalition government . schäuble , 63 , made his career in the ample shadow of former chancellor kohl when he was considered the chancellor 's closest confidant . merkel 's conservatives named the respected cdu veteran to head the interior ministry , a position he also held from 1989-1991 . schäubles rise to the top wolfgang schäuble is a protestant who was born in freiburg in 1942 . a trained lawyer by profession , he has served as an elected official for over 35 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble survived an assasination attempt by a mentally ill man in 1990 .
confined to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 that left him paralyzed him from the waist down , schäuble is considered one of the architects of german reunification . he served as interior minister in the kohl government and was chief whip of the cdu , building a reputation as a cross-party deal-maker in germany 's complex system of federal government .
during the kohl years he came to be regarded as the chancellor 's political confidante and in return for his loyalty was the only candidate allowed to rise to a position of influence within the party .
when mr kohl finally stepped down , following the cdu 's 1998 election defeat mr schäuble , inherited the leadership of the cdu .
finance scandal damages cdu just over a year after being voted out of office , helmut kohl admitted in a tv interview that the cdu had received approximately two million deutsche marks in secret donations between 1993 and 1998 .
these donations , which were not published in the party 's annual finance reports , were then funnelled back into the coffers of regional and local cdu party branches , to cover campaign costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble was considered by many to be helmut kohls right hand man when the allegations first emerged in 1999 , schäuble promised quick party-wide investigations and acted carefully to minimize political damage to his predecessor and one-time mentor . however by the beginning of 2000 it was clear that the cdu 's funding scandal engulf him as well . schäuble admitted on january 10 , 2000 , that he had received a cash donation of 100,000 dm from karlheinz schreiber , a bavarian businessman and arms dealer .
schäuble declared that this donation had not been published in the party 's official records .
he blamed brigitte baumeister , the former party treasurer , for this " mistake " and denies any personal wrong-doing . reluctant bedfellows ? chancellor-designate merkel took over the leadership of the cdu from schäuble in 2000 . but despite severe criticism from both within and outside of his party schäuble eventually salvaged his reputation and became one of germany 's most respected politicians .
he suffered a setback in 2004 when merkel refused to back him for the role of federal president , preferring the cdu 's former head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , for the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble congratulates angela merkel in 1998 after she was elected as cdu general secretary relations between merkel and schäuble have improved over the years but he is not regarded as a close ally .
still , many observers say merkel is turning to him now because she knows his political know-how will be essential if a potentially fractious government is to work . merkel has a history of sidelining party rivals and that has left her with few experienced conservative allies for top posts .
her party 's unexpectedly poor result in a sept .
18 election likewise curbed her ability to dictate who will be in her team .
as for his role as the country 's top security official , schäuble is likely to take just as tough a line on law and order as his social democrat predecessor otto schily . dw staff -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel announces german cabinet after playing tug-of-war with her own party , germany 's chancellor-designate , angela merkel , named her cabinet members on monday , ahead of coalition talks aimed at forming the new government .

a controversial figure , schäuble returns to the position which he held under former chancellor helmut kohl . wolfgang schäuble is considered by many to be the most experienced member of chancellor-designate angela merkel 's new coalition government . schäuble , 63 , made his career in the ample shadow of former chancellor kohl when he was considered the chancellor 's closest confidant . merkel 's conservatives named the respected cdu veteran to head the interior ministry , a position he also held from 1989-1991 . schäubles rise to the top wolfgang schäuble is a protestant who was born in freiburg in 1942 . a trained lawyer by profession , he has served as an elected official for over 35 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble survived an assasination attempt by a mentally ill man in 1990 .
confined to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 that left him paralyzed him from the waist down , schäuble is considered one of the architects of german reunification . he served as interior minister in the kohl government and was chief whip of the cdu , building a reputation as a cross-party deal-maker in germany 's complex system of federal government .
during the kohl years he came to be regarded as the chancellor 's political confidante and in return for his loyalty was the only candidate allowed to rise to a position of influence within the party .
when mr kohl finally stepped down , following the cdu 's 1998 election defeat mr schäuble , inherited the leadership of the cdu .
finance scandal damages cdu just over a year after being voted out of office , helmut kohl admitted in a tv interview that the cdu had received approximately two million deutsche marks in secret donations between 1993 and 1998 .
these donations , which were not published in the party 's annual finance reports , were then funnelled back into the coffers of regional and local cdu party branches , to cover campaign costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble was considered by many to be helmut kohls right hand man when the allegations first emerged in 1999 , schäuble promised quick party-wide investigations and acted carefully to minimize political damage to his predecessor and one-time mentor . however by the beginning of 2000 it was clear that the cdu 's funding scandal engulf him as well . schäuble admitted on january 10 , 2000 , that he had received a cash donation of 100,000 dm from karlheinz schreiber , a bavarian businessman and arms dealer .
schäuble declared that this donation had not been published in the party 's official records .
he blamed brigitte baumeister , the former party treasurer , for this " mistake " and denies any personal wrong-doing . reluctant bedfellows ? chancellor-designate merkel took over the leadership of the cdu from schäuble in 2000 . but despite severe criticism from both within and outside of his party schäuble eventually salvaged his reputation and became one of germany 's most respected politicians .
he suffered a setback in 2004 when merkel refused to back him for the role of federal president , preferring the cdu 's former head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , for the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble congratulates angela merkel in 1998 after she was elected as cdu general secretary relations between merkel and schäuble have improved over the years but he is not regarded as a close ally .

these donations , which were not published in the party 's annual finance reports , were then funnelled back into the coffers of regional and local cdu party branches , to cover campaign costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble was considered by many to be helmut kohls right hand man when the allegations first emerged in 1999 , schäuble promised quick party-wide investigations and acted carefully to minimize political damage to his predecessor and one-time mentor . however by the beginning of 2000 it was clear that the cdu 's funding scandal engulf him as well . schäuble admitted on january 10 , 2000 , that he had received a cash donation of 100,000 dm from karlheinz schreiber , a bavarian businessman and arms dealer .
schäuble declared that this donation had not been published in the party 's official records .
he blamed brigitte baumeister , the former party treasurer , for this " mistake " and denies any personal wrong-doing . reluctant bedfellows ? chancellor-designate merkel took over the leadership of the cdu from schäuble in 2000 . but despite severe criticism from both within and outside of his party schäuble eventually salvaged his reputation and became one of germany 's most respected politicians .
he suffered a setback in 2004 when merkel refused to back him for the role of federal president , preferring the cdu 's former head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , for the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble congratulates angela merkel in 1998 after she was elected as cdu general secretary relations between merkel and schäuble have improved over the years but he is not regarded as a close ally .
still , many observers say merkel is turning to him now because she knows his political know-how will be essential if a potentially fractious government is to work . merkel has a history of sidelining party rivals and that has left her with few experienced conservative allies for top posts .
her party 's unexpectedly poor result in a sept .
18 election likewise curbed her ability to dictate who will be in her team .
as for his role as the country 's top security official , schäuble is likely to take just as tough a line on law and order as his social democrat predecessor otto schily . dw staff -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel announces german cabinet after playing tug-of-war with her own party , germany 's chancellor-designate , angela merkel , named her cabinet members on monday , ahead of coalition talks aimed at forming the new government .

at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .
they want to know about the things that affect them directly .
which taxes will be raised or lowered ?
will their pensions rise or fall ?
will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?
will driving on the country 's freeways remain free of charge ? all of these questions will be addressed in the coming four weeks of coalition negotiations .
in this respect , the last month , while high drama for journalists , was wasted time in the eyes of most citizens . people are interested in results , even the kind of results that they suspect will be painful .
at the same time , that 's exactly what they are afraid of .
of course people know that five million unemployed will , over time , prove the ruin of the welfare state .
they 're aware that the public coffers are already in critical condition .
but they are very afraid of the actions that need to be taken to solve these problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans voted for reform , but not too much of it it is because the union parties prescribed bitter medicine to address germany 's ills during their election campaign that they did so poorly on election day .
and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .
the remaining tasks at hand could then be tackled by the next government , whatever its composition may be . felix steiner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

they accused him of exceeding his mandate , offering too many concessions in negotiations , and want him restricted before he goes to hong kong in december . france 's main farm union , fnsea , accused mandelson of " sacrificing european agriculture on the altar of economic and social deregulation , " saying thousands of jobs were threatened . not over yet mandelson has been pressuring member states to give him the negotiating power to allow him to reach a deal over farm subsidies , which he says would be to everyone 's benefit - both developing and industrial nations . trade experts say progress on cutting subsidies that developed nations pay to their farmers is crucial to agreeing on a global trade back at wto talks in hong kong in december , which could boost or hinder the world economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson wants his hands untied " the world trade talks are important for all of us , including many developing countries , " he told reporters .
" so it is very important that we are allowed to go forwards and not backwards . " eleven of the union 's 25 members , including britain , support easing subsidies and tariffs during wto negotiations . mandelson has said that his initiative to lower subsidies does not exceed his mandate and denies that he is british prime minister tony blair 's lackey .
blair and french president jacques chirac have fought frequently over eu farm subsidies , which total over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- a year and largely benefit the french . european farmers warn eu meanwhile , european farmers reiterated their demands tuesday that the european commission stay within its mandate , echoing the french government . jean-michel lemetayer , head of the french farmers ' group caf , said that the commission had to know " the limits not to go past , " particularly on the issue of opening up the european market to imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamy wants to see a deal addressing the meeting of 650 members of agriculture groups from across europe , the director-general of the wto , pascal lamy , tried to reassuring those present . " my conviction is that european farmers have no reason to be on the defensive , " lamy said .
" with these negotiations you have the opportunity to win a double dividend , " he said , because european farmers could benefit from agricultural reforms within the european union and from trade reforms by other members of the wto , which could give european manufacturers more access to fast-growing markets like brazil and india . lamy added that the united states had accepted the principle of reducing their agricultural subsidies and that the eu had to demonstrate " greater flexibility " in return .
the us has said europe needs to go further with agricultural subsidy reform . but anxieties within the farming community that the eu commission might go too far in reducing support for its farmers were backed by the president of the agricultural commission in the european parliament , joseph daul . daul said that he had " the painful feeling that the eu is capitulating at the wto .

at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .
they want to know about the things that affect them directly .
which taxes will be raised or lowered ?
will their pensions rise or fall ?
will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?
will driving on the country 's freeways remain free of charge ? all of these questions will be addressed in the coming four weeks of coalition negotiations .
in this respect , the last month , while high drama for journalists , was wasted time in the eyes of most citizens . people are interested in results , even the kind of results that they suspect will be painful .
at the same time , that 's exactly what they are afraid of .
of course people know that five million unemployed will , over time , prove the ruin of the welfare state .
they 're aware that the public coffers are already in critical condition .
but they are very afraid of the actions that need to be taken to solve these problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans voted for reform , but not too much of it it is because the union parties prescribed bitter medicine to address germany 's ills during their election campaign that they did so poorly on election day .
and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .
the remaining tasks at hand could then be tackled by the next government , whatever its composition may be . felix steiner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

some are not surprised . this year , germany ranked the 16th cleanest country out of 159 surveyed , according to transparency international 's corruption perception index 2005 , slipping from its 15th place finish last year .
some officials are attributing the slide to recent scandals and to a lack of government anti-corruption measures .
" the frequency of corruption cases that we have had to deal with in the past months has taken some people by surprise , but not us . "
peter von blomberg with transparency deutschland , the local arm of the organization , told german news agency dpa . he referred to recent corruption scandals such as the one plaguing germany 's stock exchange and added that instead of tackling corruption problems themselves , representatives of the business community have been fighting the publication of corruption studies such as this latest one . iceland is cleanest the corruption survey reports that serious levels of corruption exist in two thirds of the 159 countries examined , and that there was a clear link between poverty and corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty breeds corruption , transparency says the report found that chad , bangladesh , turkmenistan and myanmar were perceived as the most corrupt countries in the world , while iceland was the cleanest .
most of the countries that landed at the bottom of the list were in africa , while those which came in at the top were industrialized asian and western countries . the nations perceived as the most corrupt also rank among the world 's poorest , which shows how corruption and poverty feed off each other , according to the report . " corruption is a major cause of poverty as well as a barrier to overcoming it , " locking poor countries in " a cycle of misery , " said transparency international chairman peter eigen .
" corruption must be vigorously addressed if aid is to make a real difference in freeing people from poverty . " severe corruption problem despite progress on many fronts , including the soon-to-be-implemented united nations convention against corruption , 70 countries scored less than three on the cpi , indicating a severe corruption problem , the report said . the cpi index score relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business people and country analysts and ranges between 10 , which is highly clean and zero , which is highly corrupt . for example , the united states was ranked 17th with a score of 7.6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says countries must do more against corruption iceland topped the list with a score of 9.7 , followed by finland -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , new zealand -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , denmark -lrb- 9.5 -rrb- , singapore -lrb- 9.4 -rrb- , sweden -lrb- 9.2 -rrb- , switzerland -lrb- 9.1 -rrb- norway -lrb- 8.9 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 8.8 -rrb- and austria -lrb- 8.7 -rrb- . ahead of germany 's score of 8.2 were the netherlands , britain , luxembourg , canada and hong kong .
france , belgium and ireland came in at 18th , 19th and 20th , respectively .
italy ranked 40th .
new eu countries such as poland fared worse , coming in at 70th place .
bottom of the list was chad -lrb- 1.7 -rrb- , followed by bangladesh -lrb- 1.7 -rrb- , turkmenistan -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- , myanmar -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- and haiti -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fighting global corruption from germany twelve years after he founded it , peter eigen is stepping down as chief of transparency international .

the bundestag is expected to sit in mid-november to formally elect merkel as chancellor . " we must take this criticism seriously " the oldest member of the bundestag , interior minster otto schilly officially opened the session .
afterwards , norbert lammert , a christian democrat who has been a member of parliament for 25 years , was elected its new speaker , replacing social democrat wolfgang thierse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new speaker , nobert lammert -lrb- left -rrb- , with angela merkel " neither germany ’ s parties and parliament nor the government and opposition are currently highly regarded by the german public , " said lammert .
" we must take this criticism seriously , because the huge challenges our country is facing can only be tackled if germans regain trust in their political institutions . " merkel 's christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , have 226 seats in the lower house , just four more than schröder 's social democrats .
despite having given up his ambitions of serving a third term as chancellor , schröder retains a seat in the bundestag . attack on all fronts the rest of the parliament is made up by the free democrats with 61 seats , the 54 lawmakers of the left party - a mix of former communists and disgruntled social democrats - and the former governing coalition partners , the greens , who have 51 seats . germany ’ s new left party already vowed to attack the new government , especially on its social policies .
the party unites former east german communists with former leftwing spd members who were critical of gerhard schröder ’ s economic and welfare reforms , which they described as unfair to the poor .
the environmentalist greens are convinced that neither the government nor the two other opposition parties are sufficiently committed to environmentally sound policies . problems at home ? meanwhile , the german press on tuesday predicted problems ahead for merkel from her own camp following the nomination of seehofer to the agriculture ministry . known for his stance on the left wing of the conservatives , seehofer has clashed with merkel over her proposals to reform the health service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trouble from within - edmund stoiber and merkel have their differences edmund stoiber , the head of the csu and the new economy minister , insisted on seehofer 's nomination to government in exchange for his support . " stoiber could not have brought a stronger merkel opponent into the cabinet , " commented the left-wing tageszeitung daily . other newspapers said seehofer was likely to side with the eight social democrat ministers in the government in opposing large-scale reforms . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de federal reform : a critical first step now that angela merkel 's cabinet has been named , it 's time for the hard work to begin .

some are not surprised . this year , germany ranked the 16th cleanest country out of 159 surveyed , according to transparency international 's corruption perception index 2005 , slipping from its 15th place finish last year .
some officials are attributing the slide to recent scandals and to a lack of government anti-corruption measures .
" the frequency of corruption cases that we have had to deal with in the past months has taken some people by surprise , but not us . "
peter von blomberg with transparency deutschland , the local arm of the organization , told german news agency dpa . he referred to recent corruption scandals such as the one plaguing germany 's stock exchange and added that instead of tackling corruption problems themselves , representatives of the business community have been fighting the publication of corruption studies such as this latest one . iceland is cleanest the corruption survey reports that serious levels of corruption exist in two thirds of the 159 countries examined , and that there was a clear link between poverty and corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty breeds corruption , transparency says the report found that chad , bangladesh , turkmenistan and myanmar were perceived as the most corrupt countries in the world , while iceland was the cleanest .
most of the countries that landed at the bottom of the list were in africa , while those which came in at the top were industrialized asian and western countries . the nations perceived as the most corrupt also rank among the world 's poorest , which shows how corruption and poverty feed off each other , according to the report . " corruption is a major cause of poverty as well as a barrier to overcoming it , " locking poor countries in " a cycle of misery , " said transparency international chairman peter eigen .
" corruption must be vigorously addressed if aid is to make a real difference in freeing people from poverty . " severe corruption problem despite progress on many fronts , including the soon-to-be-implemented united nations convention against corruption , 70 countries scored less than three on the cpi , indicating a severe corruption problem , the report said . the cpi index score relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business people and country analysts and ranges between 10 , which is highly clean and zero , which is highly corrupt . for example , the united states was ranked 17th with a score of 7.6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says countries must do more against corruption iceland topped the list with a score of 9.7 , followed by finland -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , new zealand -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , denmark -lrb- 9.5 -rrb- , singapore -lrb- 9.4 -rrb- , sweden -lrb- 9.2 -rrb- , switzerland -lrb- 9.1 -rrb- norway -lrb- 8.9 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 8.8 -rrb- and austria -lrb- 8.7 -rrb- . ahead of germany 's score of 8.2 were the netherlands , britain , luxembourg , canada and hong kong .
france , belgium and ireland came in at 18th , 19th and 20th , respectively .
italy ranked 40th .
new eu countries such as poland fared worse , coming in at 70th place .
bottom of the list was chad -lrb- 1.7 -rrb- , followed by bangladesh -lrb- 1.7 -rrb- , turkmenistan -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- , myanmar -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- and haiti -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fighting global corruption from germany twelve years after he founded it , peter eigen is stepping down as chief of transparency international .

some are not surprised . this year , germany ranked the 16th cleanest country out of 159 surveyed , according to transparency international 's corruption perception index 2005 , slipping from its 15th place finish last year .
some officials are attributing the slide to recent scandals and to a lack of government anti-corruption measures .
" the frequency of corruption cases that we have had to deal with in the past months has taken some people by surprise , but not us . "
peter von blomberg with transparency deutschland , the local arm of the organization , told german news agency dpa . he referred to recent corruption scandals such as the one plaguing germany 's stock exchange and added that instead of tackling corruption problems themselves , representatives of the business community have been fighting the publication of corruption studies such as this latest one . iceland is cleanest the corruption survey reports that serious levels of corruption exist in two thirds of the 159 countries examined , and that there was a clear link between poverty and corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty breeds corruption , transparency says the report found that chad , bangladesh , turkmenistan and myanmar were perceived as the most corrupt countries in the world , while iceland was the cleanest .
most of the countries that landed at the bottom of the list were in africa , while those which came in at the top were industrialized asian and western countries . the nations perceived as the most corrupt also rank among the world 's poorest , which shows how corruption and poverty feed off each other , according to the report . " corruption is a major cause of poverty as well as a barrier to overcoming it , " locking poor countries in " a cycle of misery , " said transparency international chairman peter eigen .
" corruption must be vigorously addressed if aid is to make a real difference in freeing people from poverty . " severe corruption problem despite progress on many fronts , including the soon-to-be-implemented united nations convention against corruption , 70 countries scored less than three on the cpi , indicating a severe corruption problem , the report said . the cpi index score relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business people and country analysts and ranges between 10 , which is highly clean and zero , which is highly corrupt . for example , the united states was ranked 17th with a score of 7.6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says countries must do more against corruption iceland topped the list with a score of 9.7 , followed by finland -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , new zealand -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , denmark -lrb- 9.5 -rrb- , singapore -lrb- 9.4 -rrb- , sweden -lrb- 9.2 -rrb- , switzerland -lrb- 9.1 -rrb- norway -lrb- 8.9 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 8.8 -rrb- and austria -lrb- 8.7 -rrb- . ahead of germany 's score of 8.2 were the netherlands , britain , luxembourg , canada and hong kong .
france , belgium and ireland came in at 18th , 19th and 20th , respectively .
italy ranked 40th .
new eu countries such as poland fared worse , coming in at 70th place .
bottom of the list was chad -lrb- 1.7 -rrb- , followed by bangladesh -lrb- 1.7 -rrb- , turkmenistan -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- , myanmar -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- and haiti -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fighting global corruption from germany twelve years after he founded it , peter eigen is stepping down as chief of transparency international .

" we are only talking about material damage , " kaczynski , who is warsaw 's present-day mayor , told reporters at a briefing . although kaczynski , who is trailing liberal candidate donald tusk in the race for the presidency , which goes to a second round on sunday , denied he was using the lingering animosity between poland and germany to try to win votes , political analyst stanislaw mocek read the opposite into his tactic . " it is surely no fluke that he presented this report today .

tusk scored a clear win in the west in the first round of the vote . " not linked in any way " but kaczynski insisted the report was not tied to the election . " work on this report was begun in may 2004 ; it is not linked in any way whatsoever to the electoral calendar , " he told journalists , before recalling his suspicion of poland 's large neighbour to the west , germany , and stressing that poland " needs a president who speaks out decisively , not a president who is open to compromise , as the german press presents donald tusk . " the report , nearly 700 pages long and entitled " warsaw 's losses between 1939 and 1945 , " was commissioned in response to announcements that germans who were expelled from areas in western poland at the end of the war intended to seek compensation for property they had to leave behind . " if germany insists on rewriting history , if there are more demands for compensation ... we have a weapon to defend ourselves with this report , " kaczynski said . " there was no other city in occupied europe which lost more than half its inhabitants and was more than 80 percent destroyed , as was warsaw , " he said . " the germans can not be allowed to present themselves as the second victims of world war two after the jews . " strategy already used fanning the abiding distrust of germany has already been used in the election campaign . last week , kaczynski 's election team accused tusk 's grandfather of fighting in the german army in world war ii , an accusation tusk said " overstepped the bounds of decency " - and which cost kaczynski 's campaign chief jacek kurski his job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi troops march into poland in 1939 world war two started with the german invasion of poland , and accusations of collaborating with the nazis during the war still hit home , more than half a century later . " kaczynski always puts himself forward as the only good guy , " said mocek . but neither his accusations about tusk 's grandfather being in the wehrmacht , nor the report on nazi destruction in warsaw , appeared to have done the conservative presidential candidate much good . five days before the second round , opinion polls put tusk in the lead with around 58 percent of the vote , with kaczynski about 15 points behind him . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , warsaw head for cool spell strong winds of political change are blowing through the eu 's two largest members and neighbors , germany and poland .

some are not surprised . this year , germany ranked the 16th cleanest country out of 159 surveyed , according to transparency international 's corruption perception index 2005 , slipping from its 15th place finish last year .
some officials are attributing the slide to recent scandals and to a lack of government anti-corruption measures .
" the frequency of corruption cases that we have had to deal with in the past months has taken some people by surprise , but not us . "
peter von blomberg with transparency deutschland , the local arm of the organization , told german news agency dpa . he referred to recent corruption scandals such as the one plaguing germany 's stock exchange and added that instead of tackling corruption problems themselves , representatives of the business community have been fighting the publication of corruption studies such as this latest one . iceland is cleanest the corruption survey reports that serious levels of corruption exist in two thirds of the 159 countries examined , and that there was a clear link between poverty and corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty breeds corruption , transparency says the report found that chad , bangladesh , turkmenistan and myanmar were perceived as the most corrupt countries in the world , while iceland was the cleanest .
most of the countries that landed at the bottom of the list were in africa , while those which came in at the top were industrialized asian and western countries . the nations perceived as the most corrupt also rank among the world 's poorest , which shows how corruption and poverty feed off each other , according to the report . " corruption is a major cause of poverty as well as a barrier to overcoming it , " locking poor countries in " a cycle of misery , " said transparency international chairman peter eigen .
" corruption must be vigorously addressed if aid is to make a real difference in freeing people from poverty . " severe corruption problem despite progress on many fronts , including the soon-to-be-implemented united nations convention against corruption , 70 countries scored less than three on the cpi , indicating a severe corruption problem , the report said . the cpi index score relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business people and country analysts and ranges between 10 , which is highly clean and zero , which is highly corrupt . for example , the united states was ranked 17th with a score of 7.6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says countries must do more against corruption iceland topped the list with a score of 9.7 , followed by finland -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , new zealand -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , denmark -lrb- 9.5 -rrb- , singapore -lrb- 9.4 -rrb- , sweden -lrb- 9.2 -rrb- , switzerland -lrb- 9.1 -rrb- norway -lrb- 8.9 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 8.8 -rrb- and austria -lrb- 8.7 -rrb- . ahead of germany 's score of 8.2 were the netherlands , britain , luxembourg , canada and hong kong .
france , belgium and ireland came in at 18th , 19th and 20th , respectively .
italy ranked 40th .
new eu countries such as poland fared worse , coming in at 70th place .
bottom of the list was chad -lrb- 1.7 -rrb- , followed by bangladesh -lrb- 1.7 -rrb- , turkmenistan -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- , myanmar -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- and haiti -lrb- 1.8 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fighting global corruption from germany twelve years after he founded it , peter eigen is stepping down as chief of transparency international .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.10.2005 federal reform : a critical first step großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rethinking federal and state responsibilities is critical now that angela merkel 's cabinet has been named , it 's time for the hard work to begin .
at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .
they want to know about the things that affect them directly .
which taxes will be raised or lowered ?
will their pensions rise or fall ?
will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?
will driving on the country 's freeways remain free of charge ? all of these questions will be addressed in the coming four weeks of coalition negotiations .
in this respect , the last month , while high drama for journalists , was wasted time in the eyes of most citizens . people are interested in results , even the kind of results that they suspect will be painful .
at the same time , that 's exactly what they are afraid of .
of course people know that five million unemployed will , over time , prove the ruin of the welfare state .
they 're aware that the public coffers are already in critical condition .
but they are very afraid of the actions that need to be taken to solve these problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans voted for reform , but not too much of it it is because the union parties prescribed bitter medicine to address germany 's ills during their election campaign that they did so poorly on election day .
and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .
the remaining tasks at hand could then be tackled by the next government , whatever its composition may be . felix steiner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.10.2005 federal reform : a critical first step großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rethinking federal and state responsibilities is critical now that angela merkel 's cabinet has been named , it 's time for the hard work to begin .
at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .
they want to know about the things that affect them directly .
which taxes will be raised or lowered ?
will their pensions rise or fall ?
will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?
will driving on the country 's freeways remain free of charge ? all of these questions will be addressed in the coming four weeks of coalition negotiations .
in this respect , the last month , while high drama for journalists , was wasted time in the eyes of most citizens . people are interested in results , even the kind of results that they suspect will be painful .
at the same time , that 's exactly what they are afraid of .
of course people know that five million unemployed will , over time , prove the ruin of the welfare state .
they 're aware that the public coffers are already in critical condition .
but they are very afraid of the actions that need to be taken to solve these problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans voted for reform , but not too much of it it is because the union parties prescribed bitter medicine to address germany 's ills during their election campaign that they did so poorly on election day .
and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .
the remaining tasks at hand could then be tackled by the next government , whatever its composition may be . felix steiner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

" we are only talking about material damage , " kaczynski , who is warsaw 's present-day mayor , told reporters at a briefing . although kaczynski , who is trailing liberal candidate donald tusk in the race for the presidency , which goes to a second round on sunday , denied he was using the lingering animosity between poland and germany to try to win votes , political analyst stanislaw mocek read the opposite into his tactic . " it is surely no fluke that he presented this report today .
it is clearly a new element of his campaign , " said mocek of the polish academy of sciences . " kaczynski is trying to win over older voters who still vividly remember the war .
to the young , the past does n't mean much , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk , presidential candidate from the civic platform party " he is also trying to win votes in the west of the country , in regions that were german before the war , " said mocek .
tusk scored a clear win in the west in the first round of the vote . " not linked in any way " but kaczynski insisted the report was not tied to the election . " work on this report was begun in may 2004 ; it is not linked in any way whatsoever to the electoral calendar , " he told journalists , before recalling his suspicion of poland 's large neighbour to the west , germany , and stressing that poland " needs a president who speaks out decisively , not a president who is open to compromise , as the german press presents donald tusk . " the report , nearly 700 pages long and entitled " warsaw 's losses between 1939 and 1945 , " was commissioned in response to announcements that germans who were expelled from areas in western poland at the end of the war intended to seek compensation for property they had to leave behind .

things got worse when a criminal network was uncovered .
the scandal returns as the trial of those involved starts tuesday . it was the scandal that dulled the shine on germany ’ s successful campaign to host the 2006 world cup .
on tuesday , the specter of match-fixing and corruption in german soccer rears its ugly head once again when the disgraced bundesliga referee robert hoyzer and five others come to court to face fraud charges . hoyzer and his alleged cohorts are at the center of germany ’ s biggest sporting embarrassment ; a scandal involving crooked match officials , greedy and corrupt players and a network of gangsters which stretched from germany to turkey and beyond . the affair tells the story of games thrown for money , a widespread illegal betting cartel and the threats and intimidation that went with instigating a match-rigging operation which threatened to undermine the very structure of soccer in germany . trial likely to coincide with world cup draw tuesday 's opening session in berlin 's superior court will reopen wounds inflicted on the game that have barely had time to scab over .
and with the world cup due to kick off in less than nine months , german soccer authorities are hoping that the trial is concluded swiftly .
an on-going process dealing with the most sordid episode in the german game for 30 years would hardly be the best byline for the headlines trumpeting the start of germany ’ s moment in the global soccer sun . with full and partial confessions from all but one of the defendants , the trial is unlikely to still be going on by the time the first ball is kicked on june 8 , 2006 .
however , with sessions initially scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays and with lawyers in the case predicting anything from six to 12 sessions needed to conclude the case , it will almost certainly still be going on when the sport 's most powerful figures gather in leipzig before the draw for the world cup tournament on december 9 . disgraced referee hoyzer back in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer went underground after his release the trial will bring robert hoyzer back into the spotlight and will lay bare once more the details of the 26-year old ’ s involvement as a central figure in the scandal . the berlin-based former referee officiated at matches in the second division and lower leagues in the bundesliga but hit the headlines after it was revealed at the start of 2005 that he took a bribe to throw the result of the german cup first round game between top flight side hamburg sv and regional league side paderborn on august 21 , 2004 . hamburg had been leading 2-0 , but went on to lose 4-2 after hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg striker emile mpenza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei barbarez remonstrates with hoyzer in the notorious match as the investigation went on , it was revealed that hoyzer may have been involved with the fixing or attempted fixing of nine matches in total .
according to reports at the time , further investigation into hoyzer uncovered that he was paid bribes totaling 67,000 euros and was given a flat-screen television . he was arrested in february and spent two weeks in custody .
during his time in incarceration , hoyzer co-operated with berlin prosecutors and the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , who later banned him for life .
he faces 11 charges at trial , including complicity to defraud . official and shamed player face rigging charges as well as hoyer , referee dominik marks and former top flight player steffen karl are charged with involvement in the rigging of matches between april and december last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominik marks maintains his innocence marks has been accused of fixing two matches by hoyzer , one in the second division and the other in the regional northern league .
he was arrested in march 9 and spent four weeks in custody under suspicion of match-fixing .
despite maintaining his innocence , marks faces five charges . karl , a former defensive midfielder for borussia dortmund and hertha berlin , is accused of throwing games for financial gain and faces five charges . all three are accused of involvement under the orders of three croatian brothers who betted on the results .
it is thought that ante sapina , one of the brothers and the alleged gambling ringleader , made over 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.20 million -rrb- on two rigged matches alone . croatians at the heart of betting cartel # b # ante , at 27 the youngest of the three sapina brothers , faces 42 charges including the running of an illegal match-fixing operation .
the 40-year old eldest brother milan faces 11 charges of betting on rigged matches while 37-year old filip , who has apparently co-operated with investigators , faces four similar charges . the defendants will be required to enter a plea at the beginning of the trial with all – except marks – expected to plead guilty .
the offences could bring jail terms of up to 10 years , although lawyers from the defense counsel hope that the confessions and a lack of previous convictions will lead to sentences nearer the one year minimum . investigation uncovers widespread corruption in total , berlin prosecutors have investigated 25 people in connection with the scandal , many of whom are suspected of having been involved in manipulating at least 10 matches in 2004 .
there have also been 14 players investigated , from second division clubs energie cottbus , dynamo dresden and regional sides chemnitzer fc , kickers offenbach and sc paderborn . prosecutors have also seized 2.44 million euros in bank accounts and of assets belonging to the three sapina brothers during february raids . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a shadow over german soccer german soccer has struggled recently .

" france supports the spanish idea of a european-african conference on immigration , " french prime minister dominique de villepin said on monday after holding discussions with his spanish counterpart jose luis rodriguez zapatero in barcelona . " all of our countries are confronted today with this question of immigration .
we should treat it with courage , daring and imagination , " de villepin added . " spain and france will present a joint initiative at the next european council on a global plan on a response to immigration ... which commits the eu much more than it has been up to now , " prime minister zapatero told the press conference . the issue came to a head last month with a series of assaults by thousands of sub-saharan african immigrants on fencing at the spanish border surrounding the north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla - africa 's only land border with the eu . deaths and mayhem at spain 's african border at least 14 people have died in their attempt to leap over the heavily defended borders after trekking across vast swathes of africa to northern morocco .

" europe refuses to take the african immigrants , but spain and morocco can not play the role of eu policeman on their own , " a spanish spokesman told afp on behalf of the prime minister , adding it was " time to act " to solve a " humanitarian drama . "

27 and 28 . " france supports the spanish idea of a european-african conference on immigration , " french prime minister dominique de villepin said on monday after holding discussions with his spanish counterpart jose luis rodriguez zapatero in barcelona . " all of our countries are confronted today with this question of immigration .
we should treat it with courage , daring and imagination , " de villepin added . " spain and france will present a joint initiative at the next european council on a global plan on a response to immigration ... which commits the eu much more than it has been up to now , " prime minister zapatero told the press conference . the issue came to a head last month with a series of assaults by thousands of sub-saharan african immigrants on fencing at the spanish border surrounding the north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla - africa 's only land border with the eu . deaths and mayhem at spain 's african border at least 14 people have died in their attempt to leap over the heavily defended borders after trekking across vast swathes of africa to northern morocco .
some of them have been shot by moroccan security forces while desperately attempting to reach a better life in europe . bildunterschrift : african immigrants in a transit camp near spain after struggling for some time to keep the waves of immigrants from swamping its borders , spain has repeatedly called on the eu to get a grip on the roots of the illegal immigration problem by aiding the poor african countries from where migrants originate .
the reasoning behind this policy being that if better opportunities existed at home , there would be less reason for migrants to risk their lives in attempting to reach the wealthy eu . zapatero told his french counterpart that illegal immigration from sub-saharan africa was an issue that concerned the whole of africa and europe and one that morocco and spain could not deal with alone . zapatero calls on eu to avert " humanitarian drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero spoke to chirac about the immigration issue .
" europe refuses to take the african immigrants , but spain and morocco can not play the role of eu policeman on their own , " a spanish spokesman told afp on behalf of the prime minister , adding it was " time to act " to solve a " humanitarian drama . "
zapatero himself revealed that he had spoken directly by phone with french president jacques chirac about the issue . as well as storming the borders around ceuta and melilla , thousands more african migrants take to rickety boats each year in a perilous trip to the canary islands or across the gibraltar strait to southern spain .
many don ’ t make it across alive . french pm sketches out two-pronged strategy while zapatero provided no details of the proposal , de villepin hinted at a two-pronged strategy which would combine improving controls along the border regions with a development and training program in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin .
the french prime minister added that transit countries for immigrants should also be given support in protecting their borders under a new , broad european immigration policy . spain annoyed some of its eu partners earlier this year by giving documentation to hundreds of thousands of immigrants who had been working illegally in spain and then had irritated them further recently by allowing “ thousands ” more to enter spain .. neighbors " irritated " by spanish policy the spanish daily abc reported that the french and german interior ministers had complained " this week " about spain 's immigration policy , saying " 25,000 illegals from black africa have crossed the pyrenees in the past few months " to france , belgium and the netherlands . quoting police experts , abc said another 25,000 were still in spain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily the paper added that french interior minister nicolas sarkozy had called the spanish government the " sorcerer 's apprentice " in terms of immigration and called the country “ an open door ” while the paper quoted german counterpart otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- as saying that " massive -lrb- immigrant -rrb- regularization has the knock-on effect of attracting new illegals .

a controversial figure , schäuble returns to the position which he held under former chancellor helmut kohl . wolfgang schäuble is considered by many to be the most experienced member of chancellor-designate angela merkel 's new coalition government . schäuble , 63 , made his career in the ample shadow of former chancellor kohl when he was considered the chancellor 's closest confidant . merkel 's conservatives named the respected cdu veteran to head the interior ministry , a position he also held from 1989-1991 . schäubles rise to the top wolfgang schäuble is a protestant who was born in freiburg in 1942 . a trained lawyer by profession , he has served as an elected official for over 35 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble survived an assasination attempt by a mentally ill man in 1990 .
confined to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 that left him paralyzed him from the waist down , schäuble is considered one of the architects of german reunification . he served as interior minister in the kohl government and was chief whip of the cdu , building a reputation as a cross-party deal-maker in germany 's complex system of federal government .
during the kohl years he came to be regarded as the chancellor 's political confidante and in return for his loyalty was the only candidate allowed to rise to a position of influence within the party .
when mr kohl finally stepped down , following the cdu 's 1998 election defeat mr schäuble , inherited the leadership of the cdu .
finance scandal damages cdu just over a year after being voted out of office , helmut kohl admitted in a tv interview that the cdu had received approximately two million deutsche marks in secret donations between 1993 and 1998 .
these donations , which were not published in the party 's annual finance reports , were then funnelled back into the coffers of regional and local cdu party branches , to cover campaign costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble was considered by many to be helmut kohls right hand man when the allegations first emerged in 1999 , schäuble promised quick party-wide investigations and acted carefully to minimize political damage to his predecessor and one-time mentor . however by the beginning of 2000 it was clear that the cdu 's funding scandal engulf him as well . schäuble admitted on january 10 , 2000 , that he had received a cash donation of 100,000 dm from karlheinz schreiber , a bavarian businessman and arms dealer .
schäuble declared that this donation had not been published in the party 's official records .
he blamed brigitte baumeister , the former party treasurer , for this " mistake " and denies any personal wrong-doing . reluctant bedfellows ? chancellor-designate merkel took over the leadership of the cdu from schäuble in 2000 . but despite severe criticism from both within and outside of his party schäuble eventually salvaged his reputation and became one of germany 's most respected politicians .
he suffered a setback in 2004 when merkel refused to back him for the role of federal president , preferring the cdu 's former head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , for the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble congratulates angela merkel in 1998 after she was elected as cdu general secretary relations between merkel and schäuble have improved over the years but he is not regarded as a close ally .

a controversial figure , schäuble returns to the position which he held under former chancellor helmut kohl . wolfgang schäuble is considered by many to be the most experienced member of chancellor-designate angela merkel 's new coalition government . schäuble , 63 , made his career in the ample shadow of former chancellor kohl when he was considered the chancellor 's closest confidant . merkel 's conservatives named the respected cdu veteran to head the interior ministry , a position he also held from 1989-1991 . schäubles rise to the top wolfgang schäuble is a protestant who was born in freiburg in 1942 . a trained lawyer by profession , he has served as an elected official for over 35 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble survived an assasination attempt by a mentally ill man in 1990 .
confined to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 that left him paralyzed him from the waist down , schäuble is considered one of the architects of german reunification . he served as interior minister in the kohl government and was chief whip of the cdu , building a reputation as a cross-party deal-maker in germany 's complex system of federal government .
during the kohl years he came to be regarded as the chancellor 's political confidante and in return for his loyalty was the only candidate allowed to rise to a position of influence within the party .
when mr kohl finally stepped down , following the cdu 's 1998 election defeat mr schäuble , inherited the leadership of the cdu .
finance scandal damages cdu just over a year after being voted out of office , helmut kohl admitted in a tv interview that the cdu had received approximately two million deutsche marks in secret donations between 1993 and 1998 .
these donations , which were not published in the party 's annual finance reports , were then funnelled back into the coffers of regional and local cdu party branches , to cover campaign costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble was considered by many to be helmut kohls right hand man when the allegations first emerged in 1999 , schäuble promised quick party-wide investigations and acted carefully to minimize political damage to his predecessor and one-time mentor . however by the beginning of 2000 it was clear that the cdu 's funding scandal engulf him as well . schäuble admitted on january 10 , 2000 , that he had received a cash donation of 100,000 dm from karlheinz schreiber , a bavarian businessman and arms dealer .
schäuble declared that this donation had not been published in the party 's official records .
he blamed brigitte baumeister , the former party treasurer , for this " mistake " and denies any personal wrong-doing . reluctant bedfellows ? chancellor-designate merkel took over the leadership of the cdu from schäuble in 2000 . but despite severe criticism from both within and outside of his party schäuble eventually salvaged his reputation and became one of germany 's most respected politicians .
he suffered a setback in 2004 when merkel refused to back him for the role of federal president , preferring the cdu 's former head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , for the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble congratulates angela merkel in 1998 after she was elected as cdu general secretary relations between merkel and schäuble have improved over the years but he is not regarded as a close ally .
still , many observers say merkel is turning to him now because she knows his political know-how will be essential if a potentially fractious government is to work . merkel has a history of sidelining party rivals and that has left her with few experienced conservative allies for top posts .
her party 's unexpectedly poor result in a sept .
18 election likewise curbed her ability to dictate who will be in her team .
as for his role as the country 's top security official , schäuble is likely to take just as tough a line on law and order as his social democrat predecessor otto schily . dw staff -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel announces german cabinet after playing tug-of-war with her own party , germany 's chancellor-designate , angela merkel , named her cabinet members on monday , ahead of coalition talks aimed at forming the new government .

during the kohl years he came to be regarded as the chancellor 's political confidante and in return for his loyalty was the only candidate allowed to rise to a position of influence within the party .
when mr kohl finally stepped down , following the cdu 's 1998 election defeat mr schäuble , inherited the leadership of the cdu .
finance scandal damages cdu just over a year after being voted out of office , helmut kohl admitted in a tv interview that the cdu had received approximately two million deutsche marks in secret donations between 1993 and 1998 .
these donations , which were not published in the party 's annual finance reports , were then funnelled back into the coffers of regional and local cdu party branches , to cover campaign costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble was considered by many to be helmut kohls right hand man when the allegations first emerged in 1999 , schäuble promised quick party-wide investigations and acted carefully to minimize political damage to his predecessor and one-time mentor . however by the beginning of 2000 it was clear that the cdu 's funding scandal engulf him as well . schäuble admitted on january 10 , 2000 , that he had received a cash donation of 100,000 dm from karlheinz schreiber , a bavarian businessman and arms dealer .
schäuble declared that this donation had not been published in the party 's official records .
he blamed brigitte baumeister , the former party treasurer , for this " mistake " and denies any personal wrong-doing . reluctant bedfellows ? chancellor-designate merkel took over the leadership of the cdu from schäuble in 2000 . but despite severe criticism from both within and outside of his party schäuble eventually salvaged his reputation and became one of germany 's most respected politicians .
he suffered a setback in 2004 when merkel refused to back him for the role of federal president , preferring the cdu 's former head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , for the job .

some subsidy backers say brussels is keeping them in the dark . first came the proposal to reduce agricultural subsidies ; then came the backlash . peter mandelson , the eu trade commissioner , called for reducing subsidies under the bloc 's common agricultural policy by 70 percent and farm import duties by 60 percent after 2013 . then france , along with a dozen other members , called an emergency meeting tuesday to tie his hands .
they accused him of exceeding his mandate , offering too many concessions in negotiations , and want him restricted before he goes to hong kong in december . france 's main farm union , fnsea , accused mandelson of " sacrificing european agriculture on the altar of economic and social deregulation , " saying thousands of jobs were threatened . not over yet mandelson has been pressuring member states to give him the negotiating power to allow him to reach a deal over farm subsidies , which he says would be to everyone 's benefit - both developing and industrial nations . trade experts say progress on cutting subsidies that developed nations pay to their farmers is crucial to agreeing on a global trade back at wto talks in hong kong in december , which could boost or hinder the world economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson wants his hands untied " the world trade talks are important for all of us , including many developing countries , " he told reporters .

at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .
they want to know about the things that affect them directly .
which taxes will be raised or lowered ?
will their pensions rise or fall ?
will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?
will driving on the country 's freeways remain free of charge ? all of these questions will be addressed in the coming four weeks of coalition negotiations .
in this respect , the last month , while high drama for journalists , was wasted time in the eyes of most citizens . people are interested in results , even the kind of results that they suspect will be painful .
at the same time , that 's exactly what they are afraid of .
of course people know that five million unemployed will , over time , prove the ruin of the welfare state .
they 're aware that the public coffers are already in critical condition .
but they are very afraid of the actions that need to be taken to solve these problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans voted for reform , but not too much of it it is because the union parties prescribed bitter medicine to address germany 's ills during their election campaign that they did so poorly on election day .
and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .
the remaining tasks at hand could then be tackled by the next government , whatever its composition may be . felix steiner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

things got worse when a criminal network was uncovered .
the scandal returns as the trial of those involved starts tuesday . it was the scandal that dulled the shine on germany ’ s successful campaign to host the 2006 world cup .
on tuesday , the specter of match-fixing and corruption in german soccer rears its ugly head once again when the disgraced bundesliga referee robert hoyzer and five others come to court to face fraud charges . hoyzer and his alleged cohorts are at the center of germany ’ s biggest sporting embarrassment ; a scandal involving crooked match officials , greedy and corrupt players and a network of gangsters which stretched from germany to turkey and beyond . the affair tells the story of games thrown for money , a widespread illegal betting cartel and the threats and intimidation that went with instigating a match-rigging operation which threatened to undermine the very structure of soccer in germany . trial likely to coincide with world cup draw tuesday 's opening session in berlin 's superior court will reopen wounds inflicted on the game that have barely had time to scab over .
and with the world cup due to kick off in less than nine months , german soccer authorities are hoping that the trial is concluded swiftly .
an on-going process dealing with the most sordid episode in the german game for 30 years would hardly be the best byline for the headlines trumpeting the start of germany ’ s moment in the global soccer sun . with full and partial confessions from all but one of the defendants , the trial is unlikely to still be going on by the time the first ball is kicked on june 8 , 2006 .
however , with sessions initially scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays and with lawyers in the case predicting anything from six to 12 sessions needed to conclude the case , it will almost certainly still be going on when the sport 's most powerful figures gather in leipzig before the draw for the world cup tournament on december 9 . disgraced referee hoyzer back in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer went underground after his release the trial will bring robert hoyzer back into the spotlight and will lay bare once more the details of the 26-year old ’ s involvement as a central figure in the scandal . the berlin-based former referee officiated at matches in the second division and lower leagues in the bundesliga but hit the headlines after it was revealed at the start of 2005 that he took a bribe to throw the result of the german cup first round game between top flight side hamburg sv and regional league side paderborn on august 21 , 2004 . hamburg had been leading 2-0 , but went on to lose 4-2 after hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg striker emile mpenza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei barbarez remonstrates with hoyzer in the notorious match as the investigation went on , it was revealed that hoyzer may have been involved with the fixing or attempted fixing of nine matches in total .
according to reports at the time , further investigation into hoyzer uncovered that he was paid bribes totaling 67,000 euros and was given a flat-screen television . he was arrested in february and spent two weeks in custody .
during his time in incarceration , hoyzer co-operated with berlin prosecutors and the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , who later banned him for life .
he faces 11 charges at trial , including complicity to defraud . official and shamed player face rigging charges as well as hoyer , referee dominik marks and former top flight player steffen karl are charged with involvement in the rigging of matches between april and december last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominik marks maintains his innocence marks has been accused of fixing two matches by hoyzer , one in the second division and the other in the regional northern league .
he was arrested in march 9 and spent four weeks in custody under suspicion of match-fixing .
despite maintaining his innocence , marks faces five charges . karl , a former defensive midfielder for borussia dortmund and hertha berlin , is accused of throwing games for financial gain and faces five charges . all three are accused of involvement under the orders of three croatian brothers who betted on the results .
it is thought that ante sapina , one of the brothers and the alleged gambling ringleader , made over 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.20 million -rrb- on two rigged matches alone . croatians at the heart of betting cartel # b # ante , at 27 the youngest of the three sapina brothers , faces 42 charges including the running of an illegal match-fixing operation .
the 40-year old eldest brother milan faces 11 charges of betting on rigged matches while 37-year old filip , who has apparently co-operated with investigators , faces four similar charges . the defendants will be required to enter a plea at the beginning of the trial with all – except marks – expected to plead guilty .
the offences could bring jail terms of up to 10 years , although lawyers from the defense counsel hope that the confessions and a lack of previous convictions will lead to sentences nearer the one year minimum . investigation uncovers widespread corruption in total , berlin prosecutors have investigated 25 people in connection with the scandal , many of whom are suspected of having been involved in manipulating at least 10 matches in 2004 .

things got worse when a criminal network was uncovered .
the scandal returns as the trial of those involved starts tuesday . it was the scandal that dulled the shine on germany ’ s successful campaign to host the 2006 world cup .
on tuesday , the specter of match-fixing and corruption in german soccer rears its ugly head once again when the disgraced bundesliga referee robert hoyzer and five others come to court to face fraud charges . hoyzer and his alleged cohorts are at the center of germany ’ s biggest sporting embarrassment ; a scandal involving crooked match officials , greedy and corrupt players and a network of gangsters which stretched from germany to turkey and beyond . the affair tells the story of games thrown for money , a widespread illegal betting cartel and the threats and intimidation that went with instigating a match-rigging operation which threatened to undermine the very structure of soccer in germany . trial likely to coincide with world cup draw tuesday 's opening session in berlin 's superior court will reopen wounds inflicted on the game that have barely had time to scab over .
and with the world cup due to kick off in less than nine months , german soccer authorities are hoping that the trial is concluded swiftly .
an on-going process dealing with the most sordid episode in the german game for 30 years would hardly be the best byline for the headlines trumpeting the start of germany ’ s moment in the global soccer sun . with full and partial confessions from all but one of the defendants , the trial is unlikely to still be going on by the time the first ball is kicked on june 8 , 2006 .
however , with sessions initially scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays and with lawyers in the case predicting anything from six to 12 sessions needed to conclude the case , it will almost certainly still be going on when the sport 's most powerful figures gather in leipzig before the draw for the world cup tournament on december 9 . disgraced referee hoyzer back in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer went underground after his release the trial will bring robert hoyzer back into the spotlight and will lay bare once more the details of the 26-year old ’ s involvement as a central figure in the scandal . the berlin-based former referee officiated at matches in the second division and lower leagues in the bundesliga but hit the headlines after it was revealed at the start of 2005 that he took a bribe to throw the result of the german cup first round game between top flight side hamburg sv and regional league side paderborn on august 21 , 2004 . hamburg had been leading 2-0 , but went on to lose 4-2 after hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg striker emile mpenza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei barbarez remonstrates with hoyzer in the notorious match as the investigation went on , it was revealed that hoyzer may have been involved with the fixing or attempted fixing of nine matches in total .
according to reports at the time , further investigation into hoyzer uncovered that he was paid bribes totaling 67,000 euros and was given a flat-screen television . he was arrested in february and spent two weeks in custody .
during his time in incarceration , hoyzer co-operated with berlin prosecutors and the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , who later banned him for life .
he faces 11 charges at trial , including complicity to defraud . official and shamed player face rigging charges as well as hoyer , referee dominik marks and former top flight player steffen karl are charged with involvement in the rigging of matches between april and december last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominik marks maintains his innocence marks has been accused of fixing two matches by hoyzer , one in the second division and the other in the regional northern league .
he was arrested in march 9 and spent four weeks in custody under suspicion of match-fixing .
despite maintaining his innocence , marks faces five charges . karl , a former defensive midfielder for borussia dortmund and hertha berlin , is accused of throwing games for financial gain and faces five charges . all three are accused of involvement under the orders of three croatian brothers who betted on the results .
it is thought that ante sapina , one of the brothers and the alleged gambling ringleader , made over 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.20 million -rrb- on two rigged matches alone . croatians at the heart of betting cartel # b # ante , at 27 the youngest of the three sapina brothers , faces 42 charges including the running of an illegal match-fixing operation .

at the top of the agenda should be changing germany 's creaking federal structure , which has served mostly to block needed reform . " merkel 's cabinet is complete " - those words , or similar ones , make up the headlines in the majority of germany 's papers today .
and indeed , now that the conservatives have decided who will head the ministries they were alloted in grand coalition negotiations , germans do know for certain who will govern them .
but while the cabinet make-up is clear , the cabinet 's future direction is anything but . in the meantime , germany 's top journalists and talk show hosts are engaging in their favorite pursuits : analyzing who got his or her way in the doling out of cabinet positions ; opining over whether or not merkel is being strengthened or weakened by the actions of various leading politicians from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ; and trying to find out which players inside the coalition might build their own smaller coalitions behind the chancellor 's back . but such questions are of very little interest to the normal citizen .
they want to know about the things that affect them directly .
which taxes will be raised or lowered ?
will their pensions rise or fall ?
will unemployment benefits decrease in the future ?
what will a visit to the doctor , the hospital or the pharmacy cost ?
will driving on the country 's freeways remain free of charge ? all of these questions will be addressed in the coming four weeks of coalition negotiations .
in this respect , the last month , while high drama for journalists , was wasted time in the eyes of most citizens . people are interested in results , even the kind of results that they suspect will be painful .
at the same time , that 's exactly what they are afraid of .
of course people know that five million unemployed will , over time , prove the ruin of the welfare state .
they 're aware that the public coffers are already in critical condition .
but they are very afraid of the actions that need to be taken to solve these problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans voted for reform , but not too much of it it is because the union parties prescribed bitter medicine to address germany 's ills during their election campaign that they did so poorly on election day .
and it is because of that fear of change , of loss , that current surveys show the most public support going to those cabinet members who promise to maintain the status quo . those are not good signs for a coalition led by angela merkel , especially in an age when politics increasingly depends on opinion polls .
it is questionable whether she will have much room to maneuver when it comes to lowering the unemployment rate and getting germany 's budget in order . it is for that reason that the third task that the coalition negotiators have chosen to tackle - the reform of the german federal system - could prove to be the most important .
that is no easy task - it means untying the gordian knot that has developed between the federal government and the 16 federal states , or länder , and determining which is ultimately responsible for different policy areas , such as education , the environment or consumer protection . such reform would take away the possibility for citizens to sabotage the work of the federal government which they themselves elected , since state elections these days often become pure protest votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat , controlled by the states , has a say over many budget matters the result is that any federal government ready to enact serious reform is confronted in record time with massive opposition in the bundesrat - the upper house of parliament consisting of representatives from the states - and the state parliaments . this development , which has taken place over the past 15 years , has inflicted a great deal of damage on the country and if a grand coalition can do something to reverse it , there would be much to celebrate .
the remaining tasks at hand could then be tackled by the next government , whatever its composition may be . felix steiner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

" korea is an unknown country in europe .
korean culture is overshadowed by japan and china , " said hwang chi-woo , the author acting as director of the guest of honour delegation . he said his aim was simply to get europeans to talk about his country 's writing and to understand its quiet understatement , which he compared to " the light that softens everything . " a divided country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea is the guest of honor for many of the visiting authors it is also a quest to inform the west of the political plight of the korean peninsula , which was cut in two along the 38th latitude in 1948 , and their longing for reunification with the communist north . " we are all homeless .
i am not from the north or the south , i have no identity apart from the korean language , " the country 's most-read author , hwang sok-yong , told the berlin-based daily newspaper der tagesspiegel . hwang , who spent five years in prison for an unauthorised visit to north korea to promote dialogue between artists from the two states , said the heavily-guarded border between korea 's two halves seemed like a hangover from an era the rest of the world is forgetting . " it all looks like a museum depicting the cold war - it looks like make-believe , " hwang said . lost without translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt book fair focused on arabic literature last year the lack of german translations of korean works has made for a two-year race against time to get some 100 titles ready for the book fair . according to the festival spokeswoman caroline vogel , it proved to be an impossible deadline . " it is very difficult because there are not enough translations and there are not enough translators .
it is literature and not everybody can translate literature , " vogel said . " but it is always like this .
last year it was the same problem for arab authors , and i think the koreans have managed almost 80 translations . " at a kiosk near you bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asterix is in lofty company at the world 's most important book fair asterix creator albert uderzo , on the other hand , does not have any problems getting his work translated . two and half million translations of the latest title in the legendary french comic strip series about two gauls ' adventures in the roman empire went on sale in germany on friday . the germans have a love affair with asterix rivalled only by the french , to the point at which some readers forget what nationality the heroes are .
the release in germany coincided with that in france . uderzo will put in at least three public appearances at frankfurt , vogel said , including a live internet chat with eight of his translators to which fans can " listen in . " the most exhibitors ever frankfurt remains the biggest book forum for english language publishers , surpassing even the london book fair .
this year will have the most exhibitors yet with 7,000 expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret atwood , a pioneer of canadian women 's writing publishers are bringing out feminist writer margaret atwood alongside top-selling english authors nick hornby and ken follet , as well as controversial turkish author ohran pamuk .
pamuk 's seventh novel , " snow , " which tells of a surreal homecoming amid a wave of suicides prompted by a ban on the muslim headscarf , has earned him comparisons with german modernist master franz kafka . also coming to the fair is the dutch poet , novelist and playwright cees nooteboom , who has frequently been mentioned as a candidate for the nobel literature prize . echoes from sweden this year , the world 's most prestigious literary award went to british playwright harold pinter , who is published in germany by rowohlt , the same publishing house that struck it lucky last year when austria 's elfriede jelinek won the nobel prize . some 240,000 copies of her novels and plays sold within days of the announcement of the swedish academy 's decision last year , which is why rowohlt is expected to prepare for a pinter rush in frankfurt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders ' latest film will be screened during the book fair if the book fair keeps growing , vogel said it is not because the book market itself is getting bigger , but because it is moving with the times and adding innovative categories to the event . this year will see an antique book fair and a new section on magazines , while german director wim wenders is coming for a screening of his latest film " do n't come knocking " in the cinema section . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de harold pinter wins nobel literature prize leading british playwright harold pinter won the 2005 nobel literature prize on thursday , the swedish academy announced .

27 and 28 . " france supports the spanish idea of a european-african conference on immigration , " french prime minister dominique de villepin said on monday after holding discussions with his spanish counterpart jose luis rodriguez zapatero in barcelona . " all of our countries are confronted today with this question of immigration .
we should treat it with courage , daring and imagination , " de villepin added . " spain and france will present a joint initiative at the next european council on a global plan on a response to immigration ... which commits the eu much more than it has been up to now , " prime minister zapatero told the press conference . the issue came to a head last month with a series of assaults by thousands of sub-saharan african immigrants on fencing at the spanish border surrounding the north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla - africa 's only land border with the eu . deaths and mayhem at spain 's african border at least 14 people have died in their attempt to leap over the heavily defended borders after trekking across vast swathes of africa to northern morocco .
some of them have been shot by moroccan security forces while desperately attempting to reach a better life in europe . bildunterschrift : african immigrants in a transit camp near spain after struggling for some time to keep the waves of immigrants from swamping its borders , spain has repeatedly called on the eu to get a grip on the roots of the illegal immigration problem by aiding the poor african countries from where migrants originate .
the reasoning behind this policy being that if better opportunities existed at home , there would be less reason for migrants to risk their lives in attempting to reach the wealthy eu . zapatero told his french counterpart that illegal immigration from sub-saharan africa was an issue that concerned the whole of africa and europe and one that morocco and spain could not deal with alone . zapatero calls on eu to avert " humanitarian drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero spoke to chirac about the immigration issue .
" europe refuses to take the african immigrants , but spain and morocco can not play the role of eu policeman on their own , " a spanish spokesman told afp on behalf of the prime minister , adding it was " time to act " to solve a " humanitarian drama . "
zapatero himself revealed that he had spoken directly by phone with french president jacques chirac about the issue . as well as storming the borders around ceuta and melilla , thousands more african migrants take to rickety boats each year in a perilous trip to the canary islands or across the gibraltar strait to southern spain .
many don ’ t make it across alive . french pm sketches out two-pronged strategy while zapatero provided no details of the proposal , de villepin hinted at a two-pronged strategy which would combine improving controls along the border regions with a development and training program in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin .
the french prime minister added that transit countries for immigrants should also be given support in protecting their borders under a new , broad european immigration policy . spain annoyed some of its eu partners earlier this year by giving documentation to hundreds of thousands of immigrants who had been working illegally in spain and then had irritated them further recently by allowing “ thousands ” more to enter spain .. neighbors " irritated " by spanish policy the spanish daily abc reported that the french and german interior ministers had complained " this week " about spain 's immigration policy , saying " 25,000 illegals from black africa have crossed the pyrenees in the past few months " to france , belgium and the netherlands . quoting police experts , abc said another 25,000 were still in spain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily the paper added that french interior minister nicolas sarkozy had called the spanish government the " sorcerer 's apprentice " in terms of immigration and called the country “ an open door ” while the paper quoted german counterpart otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- as saying that " massive -lrb- immigrant -rrb- regularization has the knock-on effect of attracting new illegals .

some are not surprised . this year , germany ranked the 16th cleanest country out of 159 surveyed , according to transparency international 's corruption perception index 2005 , slipping from its 15th place finish last year .
some officials are attributing the slide to recent scandals and to a lack of government anti-corruption measures .
" the frequency of corruption cases that we have had to deal with in the past months has taken some people by surprise , but not us . "
peter von blomberg with transparency deutschland , the local arm of the organization , told german news agency dpa . he referred to recent corruption scandals such as the one plaguing germany 's stock exchange and added that instead of tackling corruption problems themselves , representatives of the business community have been fighting the publication of corruption studies such as this latest one . iceland is cleanest the corruption survey reports that serious levels of corruption exist in two thirds of the 159 countries examined , and that there was a clear link between poverty and corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty breeds corruption , transparency says the report found that chad , bangladesh , turkmenistan and myanmar were perceived as the most corrupt countries in the world , while iceland was the cleanest .
most of the countries that landed at the bottom of the list were in africa , while those which came in at the top were industrialized asian and western countries . the nations perceived as the most corrupt also rank among the world 's poorest , which shows how corruption and poverty feed off each other , according to the report . " corruption is a major cause of poverty as well as a barrier to overcoming it , " locking poor countries in " a cycle of misery , " said transparency international chairman peter eigen .
" corruption must be vigorously addressed if aid is to make a real difference in freeing people from poverty . " severe corruption problem despite progress on many fronts , including the soon-to-be-implemented united nations convention against corruption , 70 countries scored less than three on the cpi , indicating a severe corruption problem , the report said . the cpi index score relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business people and country analysts and ranges between 10 , which is highly clean and zero , which is highly corrupt . for example , the united states was ranked 17th with a score of 7.6 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says countries must do more against corruption iceland topped the list with a score of 9.7 , followed by finland -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , new zealand -lrb- 9.6 -rrb- , denmark -lrb- 9.5 -rrb- , singapore -lrb- 9.4 -rrb- , sweden -lrb- 9.2 -rrb- , switzerland -lrb- 9.1 -rrb- norway -lrb- 8.9 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 8.8 -rrb- and austria -lrb- 8.7 -rrb- . ahead of germany 's score of 8.2 were the netherlands , britain , luxembourg , canada and hong kong .

italy ranked 40th .

things got worse when a criminal network was uncovered .
the scandal returns as the trial of those involved starts tuesday . it was the scandal that dulled the shine on germany ’ s successful campaign to host the 2006 world cup .
on tuesday , the specter of match-fixing and corruption in german soccer rears its ugly head once again when the disgraced bundesliga referee robert hoyzer and five others come to court to face fraud charges . hoyzer and his alleged cohorts are at the center of germany ’ s biggest sporting embarrassment ; a scandal involving crooked match officials , greedy and corrupt players and a network of gangsters which stretched from germany to turkey and beyond . the affair tells the story of games thrown for money , a widespread illegal betting cartel and the threats and intimidation that went with instigating a match-rigging operation which threatened to undermine the very structure of soccer in germany . trial likely to coincide with world cup draw tuesday 's opening session in berlin 's superior court will reopen wounds inflicted on the game that have barely had time to scab over .
and with the world cup due to kick off in less than nine months , german soccer authorities are hoping that the trial is concluded swiftly .
an on-going process dealing with the most sordid episode in the german game for 30 years would hardly be the best byline for the headlines trumpeting the start of germany ’ s moment in the global soccer sun . with full and partial confessions from all but one of the defendants , the trial is unlikely to still be going on by the time the first ball is kicked on june 8 , 2006 .
however , with sessions initially scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays and with lawyers in the case predicting anything from six to 12 sessions needed to conclude the case , it will almost certainly still be going on when the sport 's most powerful figures gather in leipzig before the draw for the world cup tournament on december 9 . disgraced referee hoyzer back in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer went underground after his release the trial will bring robert hoyzer back into the spotlight and will lay bare once more the details of the 26-year old ’ s involvement as a central figure in the scandal . the berlin-based former referee officiated at matches in the second division and lower leagues in the bundesliga but hit the headlines after it was revealed at the start of 2005 that he took a bribe to throw the result of the german cup first round game between top flight side hamburg sv and regional league side paderborn on august 21 , 2004 . hamburg had been leading 2-0 , but went on to lose 4-2 after hoyzer awarded paderborn two penalties and sent off hamburg striker emile mpenza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei barbarez remonstrates with hoyzer in the notorious match as the investigation went on , it was revealed that hoyzer may have been involved with the fixing or attempted fixing of nine matches in total .
according to reports at the time , further investigation into hoyzer uncovered that he was paid bribes totaling 67,000 euros and was given a flat-screen television . he was arrested in february and spent two weeks in custody .
during his time in incarceration , hoyzer co-operated with berlin prosecutors and the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , who later banned him for life .
he faces 11 charges at trial , including complicity to defraud . official and shamed player face rigging charges as well as hoyer , referee dominik marks and former top flight player steffen karl are charged with involvement in the rigging of matches between april and december last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominik marks maintains his innocence marks has been accused of fixing two matches by hoyzer , one in the second division and the other in the regional northern league .
he was arrested in march 9 and spent four weeks in custody under suspicion of match-fixing .
despite maintaining his innocence , marks faces five charges . karl , a former defensive midfielder for borussia dortmund and hertha berlin , is accused of throwing games for financial gain and faces five charges . all three are accused of involvement under the orders of three croatian brothers who betted on the results .
it is thought that ante sapina , one of the brothers and the alleged gambling ringleader , made over 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.20 million -rrb- on two rigged matches alone . croatians at the heart of betting cartel # b # ante , at 27 the youngest of the three sapina brothers , faces 42 charges including the running of an illegal match-fixing operation .
the 40-year old eldest brother milan faces 11 charges of betting on rigged matches while 37-year old filip , who has apparently co-operated with investigators , faces four similar charges . the defendants will be required to enter a plea at the beginning of the trial with all – except marks – expected to plead guilty .

dafydd rhys williams , whose father was from bargoed , south wales , is due to undertake three spacewalks on a mission to the international space station .
but nasa has grounded the shuttle fleet until may 2006 following problems during discovery 's recent flight .
dr williams ' first mission was in 1998 when he flew the welsh flag in space .
speaking to the bbc wales news website , he said that if everything goes to plan and the next launch takes place in may , his second mission could be in march 2007 , possibly aboard endeavour .
but it is possible that could be delayed as nasa tries to solve the problem with shuttles shedding foam from the fuel tanks - and there are four other missions planned before his .
" we are looking at this mission by mission , " he said .
" hopefully ... we 're not going to have a problem with the foam again , a lot of it remains to be determined on how each flight goes . "
the ill-fated shuttle columbia took dr williams into orbit the first time his first mission was aboard columbia in 1998 and his second was to have taken place in november 2003 , again aboard columbia .
he lost close friends and nasa classmates when the spacecraft burnt up on re-entry to earth in february 2003 , killing all seven astronauts .
" it 's really hard when you lose people who are that close to you , " he said .
" and i was one of the first groups of astronauts to go into the field to participate in the recovery efforts so that made it very difficult as well .
" but i think out of all of this though we have a strong commitment to continue the legacy of human space exploration - for the crew of columbia , also for the crew of challenger and for the crew of apollo 1 .
challenger exploded a minute into its flight in january 1986 , killing the crew of seven , while a fire on apollo 1 in 1967 claimed the lives of three astronauts .
dr williams said although such tragedies brought home the hazards , he felt the missions were now " probably safer than they have been in the past " .
on his next mission , he will carry out three spacewalks , and is training underwater to install an extension to the international space station .
dr williams flew the flag for wales in tribute to his late father bill for the first time since the challenger disaster , a teacher who is also an astronaut is to fly on his mission and dr williams is keen to involve welsh schoolchildren in the educational programme .
he said : " we 're proposing flying plant growth chambers in space .
students on the ground could compare the growth rate of the terrestrial plants with the space plants .
" what would be exciting is to see if we can make the plant growth chambers that we 're going to make available in north america available to students in wales so that they can have their classroom projects going on at the same time . "
he is also hoping to visit wales again before his mission , and , having learned a few words of welsh which he broadcast from orbit in 1998 , said he wanted to brush up on the language to speak it in space again .
dr williams added : " i 'm very excited about the chance to be able to go back and fly in space again - all of us in the astronaut programme are really excited to be back flying the shuttle . "

she said : " i had thought it might have been too experimental for chapel-goers , and too strange for the rock scene .
" but people have understood what i 'm trying to do . "
the hymns were released on the cd , duw a wyr , -lrb- god knows -rrb- at the beginning of october . "

ms steffan , from sling , near tregarth , bangor , first became interested in hymns after finding a hymn book in her grandmother 's attic .
" i knew the words off by heart because i used to sing them like a polly parrot , but i had never thought what they actually meant , " she said .
" there was a feeling that something big was happening , there was a revolution behind these hymns .
" the message is ageless , no matter if you believe in a religion or not .
" you ca n't fail to be touched by the strength of feeling in the words , and understand that the people who wrote them experienced something real , " she added .
ms steffan co-worked with pianist huw warren , who lives in porthmadog , but is originally from swansea , and saxophonist mark lockheart , on the cd released by babel label in london , and distributed in wales by sain records .

a promenade is planned to link the city centre and the waterfront museum opened on monday , but critics say more needs to be done in the city centre .
gordon gibson , chair of the swansea 's civic society , has accused the council of being obsessed with roads and cars .
but the council denies that , saying its plans aim to get more people walking and using public transport .
meanwhile , chris wilkinson , the award-winning architect of the national waterfront museum is upbeat about the part of the city he has been working in - the maritime quarter .
" i think a major intervention like this will give the other things that are happening there a lot more power ...
the environment there is superb and swansea has huge potential . "
" the museum should boost swansea by turning it into more of a destination " john collins , swansea business forum the question is : can swansea exploit this potential ?
can the city , which has seen its population and manufacturing base erode since the 1980s , use the museum and other developments to turn itself around economically ?
a quarter of a million visitors are projected to visit mr wilkinson 's steel , slate and glass creation on the waterfront .
it is hoped that they will make a day of it , visiting other attractions .
" the museum should boost swansea by turning it into more of a destination , " said john collins , who is chair of the city 's business forum .
" and along with all the other investment , it 's really making local business much more confident about the future . "
some £ 300m of new money is coming into swansea , most of it from the welsh assembly government , backed by european objective one funds .
there are concerns in the city , however , about whether this money can be used to improve things on a broader front .
there is a feeling , for example , that waterfront development will not spill over even as far back as swansea 's city centre , which has been in real decline for two decades .
businesses have been leaving , as have shoppers who now prefer out-of-town centres .
eileen walton , a member of the city 's civic society , said the projects on the waterfront might split the city : " we 're talking about huge amounts of residential development down there .
wales ' tallest tower block - 29 storeys - will just concentrate things on the front . "
" we need ... to get a greater diversity of activities that will attract more people " gordon gibson , civic society swansea council is building a promenade along princess way between the waterfront museum and the kingsway roundabout , aimed at connecting the city centre to the sea .
mr wilkinson has also aligned the museum to encourage people to walk and get the building integrated into the maritime quarter and the city beyond .
however , gordon gibson , chair of swansea 's civic society , says the council is failing to regenerate the city centre because it still sees the central kingsway roundabout as a hub for traffic rather than people .
" we need to use that area to encourage pedestrians and to get a greater diversity of activities that will attract more people .
the council 's obsessed with cars and roads . "

fears that syria is using them to retain some sort of grip on the country have been exacerbated by international pressure to implement un resolution 1559 , which calls for all non-government factions to lay down their guns .
but behind the high politics lies another , more human story .
palestinian community leaders and ngo workers say that the real danger comes from the deplorable conditions in which the country 's 400,000 palestinians - refugees since the establishment of israel in 1948 - continue to live .
they argue that deteriorating services in the 12 cramped refugee camps and the lack of future prospects for the young are fomenting the conditions for extremism . "
the islamic groups are moving in .
we - the ngos - are moving out " sylvia haddad sylvia haddad , one of the palestinian elite with lebanese citizenship , runs the charity joint christian committee -lrb- jcc -rrb- , which provides refugees with training .
" now there is no more ambition in the camps , " she says .
" they say , ' even if we study , we ca n't work ' .
their big dream is to buy their cigarettes .
this is very disturbing for us as palestinian leaders . "
the malaise means that her projects are suffering .
" i have the funding , i have the teachers , i have the equipment .
i have everything .
but i do n't have the beneficiaries , " she says .
" the islamic groups are moving in .
we - the ngos - are moving out . "
unauthorised professions part of the problem is the restrictions placed by the lebanese government on palestinians ' right to work , barring them from over 70 professions .
in august , it lifted the ban on 50 jobs , although the professions - law , medicine , engineering - remain off-limits .
but palestinians say that , with a work permit costing hundreds of dollars , the change has had no impact .
" nothing happened .
no palestinian has benefited from this rule , " says hasan bakir , a palestinian journalist for al-quds newspaper .
in the heart of shatila refugee camp , locals have domestic worries , too .
every winter , residents in the southern end of the camp find their homes flooded as the over-worked water and sewage system fails to cope .
" every year we are afraid of the water ! " says nadia abdeen , resident of a ground-floor flat , describing how she threw away her contaminated furniture after the flood subsided .
" not only the seats - the carpets , clothes , beds . "
like others in the camp , she has been feeling the effects of the funding crisis that has hit the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , which is charged with providing palestinian refugees with services .
" all the people go to unrwa , but they do n't do anything , " says ms abdeen .
dreams of escape palestinian refugees draw little consolation from explanations that it is the growing population and rising healthcare costs , rather than cuts , that have led to poorer services . "
if you put them in a corner , what can they do ?
they will replace the earth with paradise " mohammad al-najjar palestinian human rights organisation " the needs are growing , but the budget is not growing at the same pace , " says hoda souaiby , unrwa 's public information officer in lebanon .
other sections of lebanon 's palestinian population have even fewer resources to draw on .
fatima kayed lives in qasmieh in south lebanon , one of many illegal " collections " , or encampments scattered across the country .
she and her six children live in a makeshift home largely constructed of corrugated iron .
" in winter , the water gets under and it is cold , " she tells me .
social worker hannan hassan , who runs a youth club in qasmieh for the french charity enfants refugies du monde , says that many young people dream of a better life abroad .
" there is no chance for the palestinians to work , because if they get an engineering or a law degree - what is next ?
so they plan to work abroad - maybe illegally . "
her brother fell victim to a common scam , paying $ 2,000 - his life savings - for the prospect of emigration to germany .
" this man asked him to visit his office in beirut , but when i tried to go , i found it was a false address , " she says .
plo funding recently , ngos have begun to highlight the plight of the " non-ids " , a group of palestinians lacking identity papers who are not recognised by the lebanese government or unrwa .
they risk imprisonment if they are caught by the authorities , and survive on the black economy - or cash from political groups .
mohammad al-najjar , project co-ordinator for the palestinian human rights organisation , is campaigning for them to be officially recognised .
" we , as palestinians , are worried about it .
of course , they will be very dangerous if the plo stops the funding , and the situation is as it is now , " he says .
" there are four to five thousand of them , and they are still young . "
he warns that they , as much as anyone , might be the force that upsets lebanon 's delicate sectarian balance .

fears that syria is using them to retain some sort of grip on the country have been exacerbated by international pressure to implement un resolution 1559 , which calls for all non-government factions to lay down their guns .
but behind the high politics lies another , more human story .
palestinian community leaders and ngo workers say that the real danger comes from the deplorable conditions in which the country 's 400,000 palestinians - refugees since the establishment of israel in 1948 - continue to live .
they argue that deteriorating services in the 12 cramped refugee camps and the lack of future prospects for the young are fomenting the conditions for extremism .
the islamic groups are moving in .
we - the ngos - are moving out sylvia haddad sylvia haddad , one of the palestinian elite with lebanese citizenship , runs the charity joint christian committee -lrb- jcc -rrb- , which provides refugees with training .
" now there is no more ambition in the camps , " she says .
" they say , ' even if we study , we ca n't work ' .
their big dream is to buy their cigarettes .
this is very disturbing for us as palestinian leaders . "
the malaise means that her projects are suffering .
" i have the funding , i have the teachers , i have the equipment .
i have everything .
but i do n't have the beneficiaries , " she says .
" the islamic groups are moving in .
we - the ngos - are moving out . "
unauthorised professions part of the problem is the restrictions placed by the lebanese government on palestinians ' right to work , barring them from over 70 professions .
in august , it lifted the ban on 50 jobs , although the professions - law , medicine , engineering - remain off-limits .
armed groups in the camps are set to move top of the agenda but palestinians say that , with a work permit costing hundreds of dollars , the change has had no impact .
" nothing happened .
no palestinian has benefited from this rule , " says hasan bakir , a palestinian journalist for al-quds newspaper .
in the heart of shatila refugee camp , locals have domestic worries , too .
every winter , residents in the southern end of the camp find their homes flooded as the over-worked water and sewage system fails to cope .
" every year we are afraid of the water ! " says nadia abdeen , resident of a ground-floor flat , describing how she threw away her contaminated furniture after the flood subsided .
" not only the seats - the carpets , clothes , beds . "
like others in the camp , she has been feeling the effects of the funding crisis that has hit the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , which is charged with providing palestinian refugees with services .
" all the people go to unrwa , but they do n't do anything , " says ms abdeen .
dreams of escape palestinian refugees draw little consolation from explanations that it is the growing population and rising healthcare costs , rather than cuts , that have led to poorer services .
if you put them in a corner , what can they do ?
they will replace the earth with paradise mohammad al-najjar palestinian human rights organisation " the needs are growing , but the budget is not growing at the same pace , " says hoda souaiby , unrwa 's public information officer in lebanon .
other sections of lebanon 's palestinian population have even fewer resources to draw on .
fatima kayed lives in qasmieh in south lebanon , one of many illegal " collections " , or encampments scattered across the country .
she and her six children live in a makeshift home largely constructed of corrugated iron .
" in winter , the water gets under and it is cold , " she tells me .
social worker hannan hassan , who runs a youth club in qasmieh for the french charity enfants refugies du monde , says that many young people dream of a better life abroad .
" there is no chance for the palestinians to work , because if they get an engineering or a law degree - what is next ?
so they plan to work abroad - maybe illegally . "
her brother fell victim to a common scam , paying $ 2,000 - his life savings - for the prospect of emigration to germany .
" this man asked him to visit his office in beirut , but when i tried to go , i found it was a false address , " she says .

fears that syria is using them to retain some sort of grip on the country have been exacerbated by international pressure to implement un resolution 1559 , which calls for all non-government factions to lay down their guns .
but behind the high politics lies another , more human story .
palestinian community leaders and ngo workers say that the real danger comes from the deplorable conditions in which the country 's 400,000 palestinians - refugees since the establishment of israel in 1948 - continue to live .
they argue that deteriorating services in the 12 cramped refugee camps and the lack of future prospects for the young are fomenting the conditions for extremism .
the islamic groups are moving in .
we - the ngos - are moving out sylvia haddad sylvia haddad , one of the palestinian elite with lebanese citizenship , runs the charity joint christian committee -lrb- jcc -rrb- , which provides refugees with training .
" now there is no more ambition in the camps , " she says .
" they say , ' even if we study , we ca n't work ' .
their big dream is to buy their cigarettes .
this is very disturbing for us as palestinian leaders . "
the malaise means that her projects are suffering .
" i have the funding , i have the teachers , i have the equipment .
i have everything .
but i do n't have the beneficiaries , " she says .
" the islamic groups are moving in .
we - the ngos - are moving out . "
unauthorised professions part of the problem is the restrictions placed by the lebanese government on palestinians ' right to work , barring them from over 70 professions .
in august , it lifted the ban on 50 jobs , although the professions - law , medicine , engineering - remain off-limits .
armed groups in the camps are set to move top of the agenda but palestinians say that , with a work permit costing hundreds of dollars , the change has had no impact .
" nothing happened .
no palestinian has benefited from this rule , " says hasan bakir , a palestinian journalist for al-quds newspaper .
in the heart of shatila refugee camp , locals have domestic worries , too .
every winter , residents in the southern end of the camp find their homes flooded as the over-worked water and sewage system fails to cope .
" every year we are afraid of the water ! " says nadia abdeen , resident of a ground-floor flat , describing how she threw away her contaminated furniture after the flood subsided .
" not only the seats - the carpets , clothes , beds . "
like others in the camp , she has been feeling the effects of the funding crisis that has hit the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , which is charged with providing palestinian refugees with services .
" all the people go to unrwa , but they do n't do anything , " says ms abdeen .
dreams of escape palestinian refugees draw little consolation from explanations that it is the growing population and rising healthcare costs , rather than cuts , that have led to poorer services .
if you put them in a corner , what can they do ?
they will replace the earth with paradise mohammad al-najjar palestinian human rights organisation " the needs are growing , but the budget is not growing at the same pace , " says hoda souaiby , unrwa 's public information officer in lebanon .
other sections of lebanon 's palestinian population have even fewer resources to draw on .
fatima kayed lives in qasmieh in south lebanon , one of many illegal " collections " , or encampments scattered across the country .
she and her six children live in a makeshift home largely constructed of corrugated iron .

derrick bensted was ordered in july 2004 to move out of half of stag cottage in whitstable , kent , because of a dispute over a lease .
he inherited the home unaware previous owners had rented half of it from the whitstable oyster and fishery company .
the firm applied to make the other half into a house but has scrapped the idea .
after being asked to move mr bensted vowed to remain in his house and bailiffs had to erect a wall in august 2004 to split the building in two , taking away his kitchen and bedroom and half his living room .
' not a priority ' previous owners had paid rent to the firm for the section it owned , but when mr bensted inherited the house in the 1990s he said he was unaware of the arrangement and did not pay .
the oyster company 's development manager james green said the firm had withdrawn its application to transform its half of the building after councillors were recommended to turn the application down .

venus express will blast off aboard a russian rocket from baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan on 26 october .
it will slip into orbit around venus next year , using science instruments to study the planet from space .
venus underwent runaway greenhouse warming , so experts think it may offer clues to how earth will evolve .
venus has developed in quite a different way to our own planet dr andrew coates , ucl at face value , venus and earth would seem to be similar ; they are of comparable size and mass and were born out of the same cloud of stellar gas .
but that is more or less where the resemblance ends .
ground temperatures on venus can reach 460c and the thick atmosphere generates surface pressures similar to those found one kilometre down in earth 's oceans .
fire and brimstone venus express will carry out the first global investigation of venus ' atmosphere , to shed light on how the planet evolved its hellish climate .
the highly reflective layer of clouds , which rain sulphuric acid , absorbs less heat from the sun than does the earth , despite the fact venus is a third closer to our star .
the mission will shed light on the planet 's hellish environment but once absorbed , solar energy is trapped by an atmosphere that is 96 % carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- .
this has led to an extreme greenhouse effect with volcanism perhaps contributing to the warming .
" venus has developed in quite a different way to our own planet , " said dr andrew coates , a co-investigator on the aspera science instrument .
" in some ways it could be thought of as an evil twin of earth . "
the us magellan probe , sent to map venus , revealed extensive volcanic flows on the planet 's surface .
" i suspect that venus is very volcanically active but we do n't know that for certain , " said oxford university 's professor fred taylor , an interdisciplinary scientist on the mission .
venus has undergone runaway greenhouse warming the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- mission will investigate this question and others in a mission that lasts two venusian days , equivalent to about 500 of our own .
british industry has played a significant role in the mission .
stevenage-based company eads-astrium built the propulsion system and scisys , based in wiltshire , built mission control systems .
venus express will lift-off from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan aboard a soyuz rocket .
an upper " fregat " stage with the orbiter mounted on top will then enter a sub-orbital trajectory .
after two burns , fregat will launch the spacecraft into an escape trajectory that takes it directly to venus .
after about five months , venus express will reach its target and enter an elliptical polar orbit .

scientists at newcastle university have developed what they claim is an early warning system to aid treatment of skin cancer and skin damaged by sunburn .
the " skin physical " test uses dna technology to give patients a measure of the extent of damage .
the £ 200-a-time test is only available privately , but researchers hope it will be taken up by the nhs soon .
the technology has been developed by a north american company , which invested more than £ 800,000 in its base at newcastle university .
this will let people know how sun damaged their skin is and the preventative steps that can be taken to reduce future risk prof mark birch-machin , newcastle university additional funding of £ 200,000 came from regeneration agency one northeast .
the test involves tiny skin samples being sent to a team at the university , who would analyse the sample and send results back electronically or by post .
prof mark birch-machin , of dermatological sciences at newcastle university , said : " this will help to make a significant contribution to the decrease in skin cancer , which has one of the fastest growing cancer incidences in europe and totals 70,000 new cases each year in the uk .
" our research group at newcastle is leading world advances in this field .
" the unique element of our work is being able to measure the sunburnt dna in normal , healthy people rather than just in people who are suffering from skin cancer .
" we have managed to find a particular dna marker which tells us who has been damaged and how much they have been damaged .
" this will let people know how sun-damaged their skin is and the preventative steps that can be taken to reduce future risk . "

the poll asked how they would regard a leader of the conservative party if it emerged that he had taken illegal drugs .
two thirds -lrb- 66 % -rrb- of voters said it would make no difference to whether they would vote conservative if they knew the leader of the party had used cocaine at some point in the past , with 28 % of voters saying they would be less likely to vote conservative if they knew the party 's leader had used cocaine .
the poll also asked about cannabis .
it asked : would knowing that the leader of the conservative party had used cannabis at some time in the past make you more or less likely to vote conservative or would it make no difference ? 82 % of the voting public said it would make no difference , 11 % said less likely , 4 % more likely and 3 % did n't know .
tory target voters however , of people who vote conservative or would at least consider voting conservative at some point , the knowledge that the leader of the conservative party had used cannabis at some time in the past , made very little difference to whether they are likely to vote conservative with 81 % saying it would make no difference , 9 % less likely and 8 % more likely .
amongst some groups of electors , the knowledge that the leader of the conservative party may have used cannabis , may actually be a net positive .
in the age group 25-34 , 7 % said it would make them " more likely " to vote conservative compared with 5 % saying " less likely " , a net " more likely " of 2 % .
amongst people who are currently non-conservative voters but say they would consider voting conservative , 16 % said it would make them " more likely " to vote conservative compared with 10 % saying " less likely " - a net of 6 % saying " more likely " .
the results of this poll were released by newsnight on monday , 17 october , 2005 .
1,003 people were surveyed between 14 and 16 october , 2005 .

she is one of a group with breast cancer who have been campaigning to be prescribed the drug herceptin on the nhs .
but her battle , replicated many times over across the uk , is caught in the eye of a red tape storm .
alison , who is 44 , found a lump under her arm last year .
i believe i am only halfway through my life and i want to be able to grow old disgracefully alison poole it was quickly diagnosed as breast cancer and removed in wide incision surgery which also , she explains cheerily , took away the sweat glands in her right armpit .
the cancer had already spread to alison 's lymph glands at the base of her neck .
her oncologist put her on tamoxifen , another much-trumpeted drug , which works on the hormones causing the disease .
she has had chemotherapy and finished her 14th course of radiotherapy last week .
looking healthy five live decided to follow alison 's quest to get her questions about treatment with herceptin answered .
when i meet her and one of her two daughters , 17-year-old hayley , at the city general hospital in stoke-on-trent , she looked to be glowing with good health .
" that 's the thing with this disease , " she explains , " you can have absolutely no idea you are ill when it happens - i was feeling really fit and well when i found the lump .
" and the chemo makes you brown , but i have skin burns from the toxins here on my neck - it 's like you 've been in the sun too long - and my veins are ruined ! "
she believes in being ' upfront ' about her condition , not least for the sake of her family and the countless other women who have contacted the group over recent weeks with their heartache .
being ' upfront ' means she is happy to show me the neat scar above her right breast to prove ' what a good job they did ' .
she refers to it as her crocodile bite .
new hairstyle alison 's hair is cropped short - it 's a style she 's adopted by default after losing her hair .
" well , i had quite a thick ' bob ' before , but i quite like this style now - i never would have tried it before - i think it suits me ! "
i am at a far higher risk of getting secondary breast cancer than any side-effects from herceptin alison poole i ask her why she wants to take an unlicensed drug with side-effects - herceptin is licensed for advanced breast cancer , but wo n't be licensed for the early stages until february at the earliest .
then will have to be considered by the england and wales authority nice before it can be recommended for use on the nhs next spring or summer .
this is the red tape which so far prevents alison from getting it free of charge .
" the reason why i am willing to take that chance is because i am at a far higher risk of getting secondary breast cancer than any side-effects from herceptin and i want to live for my children .
" i believe i am only halfway through my life and i want to be able to grow old disgracefully ! "
specialist meeting i go with alison to see her oncologist dr murray brunt who , ironically , referred several other women to the international herceptin trials before alison came along .
dr brunt supports alison 's case alison was diagnosed too late to be on the trial .
" alison 's breast cancer is what 15-20 % of women with the disease have " he explains .
" it is an aggressive her2 type , which means she has too many copies of the gene her2 and it overproduces protein , which causes the cancer . "
secondary cancers develop more quickly in her2 positive women and alison has been told by dr brunt hers is likely to come back .
" i would like to give you herceptin , because that would halve the risk of it coming back now .
" because it 's not funded on the nhs -lrb- it would cost £ 23,000 for a year 's treatment - more than £ 40,000 privately -rrb- , i 've put in a request asking for it for you .
" i 've written to the medical director of the trust who supports my request , and it 's been passed to the primary care trust . "
key development the news that alison 's specialist is prepared to take clinical responsibility for giving her the drug is crucial .
health secretary patricia hewitt has pointed out that clinicians are able to take that decision to get herceptin for their patients ahead of licensing .
what this really needs is a national initiative to pay for it dr murray brunt but dr brunt feels that is a disingenuous observation , because he still has to go to the pct pot to fund it .
he said : " it is frustrating , not so much locally from the pct part , but as a country .
" there are , i think , about 30 countries now that have gone ahead to give this drug - they are all in the same situation - it has n't yet got a license and yet they 've looked at the data and they 've said ' we will put specific money , hypothecated funds , into this ' .
" that 's really what i 'd like us to do in the uk .
the burden is being put on the pct 's who have n't been given a budget specifically for it , but what this really needs is a national initiative to pay for it . "
fingers crossed outside dr brunt 's office i ask alison if she 's pleased to hear her case has been recommended for funding .
if i get cancer again , i am going to cost the nhs a heck of a lot of money anyway , so they should take the long-term view alison poole " well , i wo n't hold my breath !
dr brunt says he 's written five letters for women so far , and is writing requests for another four .
" some of them are in our group and have already had letters saying ' no ' .
" i 've had to go ahead and raid my savings and pension fund to get herceptin privately for now - i 'm hoping to start it next month , because it 's clear i have n't got time to wait .
" but i just do n't see why i should have to use that money to stay alive .
" if i get cancer again , i am going to cost the nhs a heck of a lot of money anyway , so they should take the long-term view . "
we request a meeting with north stoke primary care trust .
the ultimate irony is that they employ alison , who is an elderly care nurse .
case considered the director of corporate affairs tells me : " we are shortly going to be considering alison 's case .
" a meeting with her now is not something we can consider .
we find these meetings can be too upsetting for the patients . "
alison is not impressed : " we feel as though we 're on a merry-go-round .
everybody is blaming everybody else .
" we want people to tell the truth for a change .
we want them to tell us the facts as it is .
" if they could be courageous and just say it is a lack of funding then we 'll know where to go to and ask the right questions . "
because north stoke pct felt unable to meet with alison , we took her to london to speak with gill morgan , chief executive of the nhs confederation , which represents nhs trusts .
the chief executive gill morgan tells alison she could not discuss her individual case .
but she said that if pcts gave unlicensed drugs to patients , they would be left in a difficult legal position .
postcode lottery " once it is licensed you 'll be in a much stronger position .
a good pct will be forward planning now how much money they need to put aside to pay for these drugs once nice has evaluated them .
" this is a tragedy and a terrible situation for you , and i understand what your frustrations and fears are , but we have this system to give assurances for patients . "
it 's not an argument alison can stomach : " that argument is already lost , because we know that the nhs are funding it down south for some women .
" you ca n't have one rule for some and not for all the rest .
i am prepared to sign a waiver , i have the backing of my oncologist , what more do they need ?
" i feel like i 've been resigned to the scrapheap , because i live in north stafforshire . "
on wednesday : alison speaks to the drug company which has developed herceptin .

specialist meeting i go with alison to see her oncologist dr murray brunt who , ironically , referred several other women to the international herceptin trials before alison came along .
dr brunt supports alison 's case alison was diagnosed too late to be on the trial .
" alison 's breast cancer is what 15-20 % of women with the disease have " he explains .
" it is an aggressive her2 type , which means she has too many copies of the gene her2 and it overproduces protein , which causes the cancer . "
secondary cancers develop more quickly in her2 positive women and alison has been told by dr brunt hers is likely to come back .
" i would like to give you herceptin , because that would halve the risk of it coming back now .
" because it 's not funded on the nhs -lrb- it would cost £ 23,000 for a year 's treatment - more than £ 40,000 privately -rrb- , i 've put in a request asking for it for you .
" i 've written to the medical director of the trust who supports my request , and it 's been passed to the primary care trust . "
key development the news that alison 's specialist is prepared to take clinical responsibility for giving her the drug is crucial .
health secretary patricia hewitt has pointed out that clinicians are able to take that decision to get herceptin for their patients ahead of licensing .
what this really needs is a national initiative to pay for it dr murray brunt but dr brunt feels that is a disingenuous observation , because he still has to go to the pct pot to fund it .
he said : " it is frustrating , not so much locally from the pct part , but as a country .
" there are , i think , about 30 countries now that have gone ahead to give this drug - they are all in the same situation - it has n't yet got a license and yet they 've looked at the data and they 've said ' we will put specific money , hypothecated funds , into this ' .
" that 's really what i 'd like us to do in the uk .
the burden is being put on the pct 's who have n't been given a budget specifically for it , but what this really needs is a national initiative to pay for it . "
fingers crossed outside dr brunt 's office i ask alison if she 's pleased to hear her case has been recommended for funding .
if i get cancer again , i am going to cost the nhs a heck of a lot of money anyway , so they should take the long-term view alison poole " well , i wo n't hold my breath !
dr brunt says he 's written five letters for women so far , and is writing requests for another four .
" some of them are in our group and have already had letters saying ' no ' .
" i 've had to go ahead and raid my savings and pension fund to get herceptin privately for now - i 'm hoping to start it next month , because it 's clear i have n't got time to wait .
" but i just do n't see why i should have to use that money to stay alive .
" if i get cancer again , i am going to cost the nhs a heck of a lot of money anyway , so they should take the long-term view . "
we request a meeting with north stoke primary care trust .
the ultimate irony is that they employ alison , who is an elderly care nurse .
case considered the director of corporate affairs tells me : " we are shortly going to be considering alison 's case .
" a meeting with her now is not something we can consider .
we find these meetings can be too upsetting for the patients . "
alison is not impressed : " we feel as though we 're on a merry-go-round .
everybody is blaming everybody else .
" we want people to tell the truth for a change .
we want them to tell us the facts as it is .
" if they could be courageous and just say it is a lack of funding then we 'll know where to go to and ask the right questions . "
because north stoke pct felt unable to meet with alison , we took her to london to speak with gill morgan , chief executive of the nhs confederation , which represents nhs trusts .
the chief executive gill morgan tells alison she could not discuss her individual case .
but she said that if pcts gave unlicensed drugs to patients , they would be left in a difficult legal position .
postcode lottery " once it is licensed you 'll be in a much stronger position .
a good pct will be forward planning now how much money they need to put aside to pay for these drugs once nice has evaluated them .
" this is a tragedy and a terrible situation for you , and i understand what your frustrations and fears are , but we have this system to give assurances for patients . "
it 's not an argument alison can stomach : " that argument is already lost , because we know that the nhs are funding it down south for some women .
" you ca n't have one rule for some and not for all the rest .
i am prepared to sign a waiver , i have the backing of my oncologist , what more do they need ?
" i feel like i 've been resigned to the scrapheap , because i live in north stafforshire . "
on wednesday : alison speaks to the drug company which has developed herceptin .

" i 've had to go ahead and raid my savings and pension fund to get herceptin privately for now - i 'm hoping to start it next month , because it 's clear i have n't got time to wait .
" but i just do n't see why i should have to use that money to stay alive .
" if i get cancer again , i am going to cost the nhs a heck of a lot of money anyway , so they should take the long-term view . "
we request a meeting with north stoke primary care trust .
the ultimate irony is that they employ alison , who is an elderly care nurse .
case considered the director of corporate affairs tells me : " we are shortly going to be considering alison 's case .
" a meeting with her now is not something we can consider .
we find these meetings can be too upsetting for the patients . "
alison is not impressed : " we feel as though we 're on a merry-go-round .
everybody is blaming everybody else .
" we want people to tell the truth for a change .
we want them to tell us the facts as it is .
" if they could be courageous and just say it is a lack of funding then we 'll know where to go to and ask the right questions . "
because north stoke pct felt unable to meet with alison , we took her to london to speak with gill morgan , chief executive of the nhs confederation , which represents nhs trusts .
the chief executive gill morgan tells alison she could not discuss her individual case .
but she said that if pcts gave unlicensed drugs to patients , they would be left in a difficult legal position .
postcode lottery " once it is licensed you 'll be in a much stronger position .
a good pct will be forward planning now how much money they need to put aside to pay for these drugs once nice has evaluated them .
" this is a tragedy and a terrible situation for you , and i understand what your frustrations and fears are , but we have this system to give assurances for patients . "
it 's not an argument alison can stomach : " that argument is already lost , because we know that the nhs are funding it down south for some women .
" you ca n't have one rule for some and not for all the rest .
i am prepared to sign a waiver , i have the backing of my oncologist , what more do they need ?
" i feel like i 've been resigned to the scrapheap , because i live in north stafforshire . "
on wednesday : alison speaks to the drug company which has developed herceptin .

a recent global survey across 15 countries revealed that the most desired features in a future mobile device was a long-life battery .
two-thirds of mobile and personal digital assistant owners said two days ' active battery life was vital .
the report said that poor battery life on mobile devices was one of the main reasons people did not play more games , music and video on their devices more often .
but the field of power is one which has not kept up with the speed of advances in processor performance and capabilities of consumer electronics . "
what very often makes more sense is a hybridised technology ; so you have both - the fuel cell is like a battery recharger " gary mepsted , qinetiq " the issue is that , as far as batteries go , there has not been major development .
and even on the horizon , a doubling in performance would be a big , big step , " explains dr vishal nayar , from the uk 's former defence research labs , qinetiq .
power experts there think that although conventional batteries -lrb- lithium ions -rrb- will be around for long time yet , we may start to see more of a mix of power solutions over the next five to 10 years .
scientists at qinetiq are working on several power solutions .
many of their ideas will first benefit the battlefield soldier , who needs lightweight portable and reliable power systems , before they make their way into everyday gadgets .
old friends fuel-cell technology is one of the most promising fields for power .
they convert the chemical energy stored in sources of fuel , such as hydrogen or methanol , into electrical energy .
they are one of the leading technologies that have the potential to leap ahead in terms of what batteries can do , thinks qinetiq .
companies such as nec , olympus and toshiba , are just some of the hi-tech firms looking to exploit fuel cells for consumer devices ; although in march this year , nokia announced it was halting its plans to develop fuel-cell-powered devices because the sector was " not mature " enough .
toshiba has developed a fuel-cell laptop , digital music player , and a mobile phone , but there is no confirmed date for the launch of any products .
last year , it showcased a tiny prototype fuel cell the size of a thumb .
it claims the methanol fuel cell could power gadgets for 20 hours or more .
although methanol is one of the most promising source of fuel for smaller consumer electronic devices , according to experts , there are concerns around the potential toxicity of methanol vapour , as a result of methanol leaking across the membrane in a fuel cell .
international flight regulations already prohibit taking methanol on aircraft because it is highly flammable .
the regulations are to be reviewed in 2007 .
so qinetiq is already working with companies such as olympus to come up with more efficient and non-flammable sources of fuel , such as solid hydrogen pellets .
consumer electronics devices - multimedia mobiles , personal digital assistants , multimedia digital video players and cameras - will represent the first major mass market for fuel cells , according to chemical industry consultants .
the first available products powered by direct methanol fuel cells for portable consumer electronics are expected to be launched within two years .
with 470 million consumer electronic devices requiring portable power , it could represent a fuel cell business worth about $ 25bn .
life in the lithium but continuing improvements in fuel cell technology will not signal the death of the conventional lithium ion battery just yet .
engineers and technologists continue to develop displays , chips and other innards that do not eat up as much power which prolongs the life of lithium ion .
one of the biggest challenges is that different functions on a laptop , for instance , require different amounts of power ; it is a crisis of functionality versus total power available .
" the current situation is that there is a growing amount of functionality being added from everything to mobiles , laptops and other consumer gadgets , " explains dr nayar .
" there are some devices out there that are good at managing power , but if you start to use the dvd player function , immediately the lifetime will go down to two hours from five . "
these kinds of peaks and troughs is something which methanol-based fuel cell technology does not deal with particularly well yet , he says .
lithium ion batteries are being developed which use different chemical make-ups , and micro-components are also being refined using new nano-structure materials , to make them better at what they do to increase efficiency , cycle life , and power capability .
lithium-ion phosphate and lithium-ion sulphur battery technologies are both being worked on as alternative battery make-ups , but they are some way off from becoming a commercial reality .
in the meantime , the scientists at qinetiq think the most likely development in the near future will combine conventional lithium ion batteries with fuel cells .
" i think what is likely to happen , and what very often makes more sense , is a hybridised technology ; so you have both - the fuel cell is like a battery recharger , " says dr gary mepsted , who heads up all of qinetiq 's fuel cell and battery research .
" for consumer electronics , the hybrid approach is going to be augmented because one area under rapid development is , rather than using batteries , people using supercapacitors for large devices .
" there is also growth in miniature supercapacitors .
they do n't have the resistive losses in conventional batteries .
these power devices will potentially be a mix of fuel cells , energy storage and electronics , " says dr mepsted .

it claims the methanol fuel cell could power gadgets for 20 hours or more .
medis showed off its fuel cell recently in japan although methanol is one of the most promising source of fuel for smaller consumer electronic devices , according to experts , there are concerns around the potential toxicity of methanol vapour , as a result of methanol leaking across the membrane in a fuel cell .
international flight regulations already prohibit taking methanol on aircraft because it is highly flammable .
the regulations are to be reviewed in 2007 .
so qinetiq is already working with companies such as olympus to come up with more efficient and non-flammable sources of fuel , such as solid hydrogen pellets .
consumer electronics devices - multimedia mobiles , personal digital assistants , multimedia digital video players and cameras - will represent the first major mass market for fuel cells , according to chemical industry consultants .
the first available products powered by direct methanol fuel cells for portable consumer electronics are expected to be launched within two years .
with 470 million consumer electronic devices requiring portable power , it could represent a fuel cell business worth about $ 25bn .
life in the lithium but continuing improvements in fuel cell technology will not signal the death of the conventional lithium ion battery just yet .
engineers and technologists continue to develop displays , chips and other innards that do not eat up as much power which prolongs the life of lithium ion .
one of the biggest challenges is that different functions on a laptop , for instance , require different amounts of power ; it is a crisis of functionality versus total power available .
" the current situation is that there is a growing amount of functionality being added from everything to mobiles , laptops and other consumer gadgets , " explains dr nayar .
" there are some devices out there that are good at managing power , but if you start to use the dvd player function , immediately the lifetime will go down to two hours from five . "
with more to do for gadgets , " power pain " has become a big issue these kinds of peaks and troughs is something which methanol-based fuel cell technology does not deal with particularly well yet , he says .
lithium ion batteries are being developed which use different chemical make-ups , and micro-components are also being refined using new nano-structure materials , to make them better at what they do to increase efficiency , cycle life , and power capability .
lithium-ion phosphate and lithium-ion sulphur battery technologies are both being worked on as alternative battery make-ups , but they are some way off from becoming a commercial reality .
in the meantime , the scientists at qinetiq think the most likely development in the near future will combine conventional lithium ion batteries with fuel cells .
" i think what is likely to happen , and what very often makes more sense , is a hybridised technology ; so you have both - the fuel cell is like a battery recharger , " says dr gary mepsted , who heads up all of qinetiq 's fuel cell and battery research .
" for consumer electronics , the hybrid approach is going to be augmented because one area under rapid development is , rather than using batteries , people using supercapacitors for large devices .
" there is also growth in miniature supercapacitors .
they do n't have the resistive losses in conventional batteries .
these power devices will potentially be a mix of fuel cells , energy storage and electronics , " says dr mepsted .

consumer price index -lrb- cpi -rrb- inflation rose to 2.5 % , from 2.4 % in august , the office for national statistics said .
the underlying rate of retail price inflation rose from 2.3 % to 2.5 % , but the headline rate - which includes mortgages - fell to 2.7 % from 2.8 % .
petrol costs did fuel the rise , but their effect was slightly offset by falling footwear and clothing prices .
fuel factor the ons added that the average price for ultra-low sulphur petrol rose by 4.6p per litre in september , compared with a rise of around 0.1p a year ago . "
these numbers probably pull the argument away from mervyn king 's implied hawkishness against higher rates " david brown , bears stearns international a steep fall in the cost of air fares also helped to limit the increase in inflation .
statisticians said rising recreation and culture costs had also contributed to the increase .
cut price offers for computer game consoles on the high street last year had not been repeated while theatre ticket prices had risen , the ons explained .
however , " core inflation " , excluding energy costs and food , drink and tobacco , was unchanged at 1.7 % .
the rise in cpi inflation means the figure has now stayed above the government 's target of 2 % for three months in a row .
it is the highest rate of consumer price inflation since january 1997 when the index first started .
before december 2003 , the bank of england used the retail price index -lrb- rpi -rrb- , which included the cost of mortgages and other housing costs , as its target for inflation .
the rpi is still used to index state benefits like pensions .
in its quarterly inflation report in august , the bank of england predicted cpi inflation would rise above government targets in the short term .
but it predicted that inflation would then ease off before gathering strength and passing the 2 % level at the end of its two-year forecast period .
concerns eased experts said the figures were a surprise , as cpi inflation had been expected to come in at 2.7 % and to rise even higher levels in coming months .
" some of the concerns out there about cpi hitting 3 % ... at least in the short term look overdone , " said ross walker , uk economist at rbs financial markets .
" unless we get another surge in oil prices , this may well mark the peak , " mr walker added .
crude oil recently reached record highs of $ 70 a barrel amid fears over the effect of hurricanes katrina and rita , however , prices are now beginning to fall back slightly .
analysts added the uk could " breathe a sigh of relief " over the predicted fallout for interest rates .
" these numbers probably pull the argument away from mervyn king 's implied hawkishness against higher rates back to the doves camp and for the uk easing bias to stay intact , " said david brown , chief european economist at bears stearns international said .
howard archer at global insight added he believed the " door was still ajar " for a rate cut this year - particularly as core inflation had remained steady .
