once seen as a key element in the reinvigoration of the national team , the fast-moving train has derailed .
his chances of playing for germany are sinking rapidly . huth was brought to england from berlin in 2001 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : riesling from the rhineland and other divine drops discounter aldi pulls top german vintners into low-cost fold eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines german vintners feel squeeze from new world wines vintners toast german wine 's popularity business -pipe- 22.10.2005 the wines they are a-changin ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more competition means vintners have to produce better wines german winegrowers are innovating and returning to their roots in order to compete in an increasingly cut-throat industry . high above the rhine near rüdesheim , the times they are a-changing in the world of wine . anthony hammond is an up-and-coming grower in the rheingau region who 's making waves and catching raves with his unconventional wines although he 's only been in the business for four years .
but hammond is willing to experiment and calls his vineyard the " garage winery . " " people expect something different from me , " he said .
" i have to present something different , something that people think is interesting and that they want to taste and hopefully buy . " germany is the world 's 9th biggest wine grower , and about a quarter of its wines are sold abroad .
britons bought 97 million liters last year and even the french bought 11.2 million liters . even so , new players have been joining the world wine market , which is forcing germans producers to place quality over quantity in order to compete .
but even very high quality is n't always enough .
vineyards often have to come up with unique selling points to establish themselves on the world market , say experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quality beats quantity these days " germany imports more wine than anywhere else , " said ingo swoboda , a wine critic and author .
" that 's why it 's important for growers to have their own image - a german image for german wine .
they also need new ideas to keep up with competitors from overseas . " innovation a hit the rheingau region is at the heart of the german wine industry , which has flourished here for a thousand years .
but increasingly , new names and new products are making their way onto the market .
those include a sort-of riesling-prosecco described by its makers as " frivolous . "
some 20 young growers are involved in its production . " back when we started , the older generation of growers snickered at us and doubted we 'd be successful , " said vintner frank nikolai .
" they could n't believe we wanted to launch the idea together . " their creation has been a hit .
each of the growers contributes part of their riesling harvest to the joint effort .
production is subject to strict quality controls and judges make sure that only wines that meet the standards are used to make the prosecco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : innovation popular in the traditional art embracing new trends does n't mean having to forego tradition .
hans-josef becker uses many of the same techniques as his grandfather .
at the same time , he 's not afraid to tinker .
he was the first german grower to use glass stoppers instead of corks . " it 's really easy to remove the glass stopper , " becker said .
" and you can close it again so that you can put the bottle in the refrigerator . " becker decided to switch to glass stoppers because of the declining quality of natural corks : the more delicate a wine is , like the dry rieslings in his region , the more sensitive it is to unpleasant aftertastes or changes that can come about because of the cork .
the glass stoppers have helped avoid spoiled bottles and won over customers . back to basics there are a total of 13 wine-growing regions in germany : the largest ones , are along the rhine and neckar valleys in the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
but the region around the mosel , saar and ruwer valleys is also famous for its own light , dry white wine - the riesling . a century ago , this was the most expensive wine in the world .
but its reputation , particularly since 1985 , has been declining along with its export numbers .
now , that is beginning to change with a new generation of innovative vintners who want to return the reputation of old . roman niewodniczanski of van volxem vinyard is one of those growers .
he bought an old jesuit monastery in wiltingen on the saar river and completely renovated it - keeping only the wooden wine barrels .
just like in the past , the must - juice from the grapes - ferments in the barrels without any added ingredients . he also believes in going for quality over quantity .
in the past , the vineyards in the region tried to produce as much as possible and as a result , quality - and business - suffered . as a result , he gives his grapes as much sunshine and space as possible .
he is having his stock thinned out and the remaining grapes on the vine wo n't be harvested until november when they 've had the opportunity to soak up as much sun as possible . " if you try these grapes you 'll notice very strong exotic fruit flavors : apricot , passion fruit , papaya - lovely fruit combinations - and they produce fantastic wines , " he said . " we want to produce complex , hand-made wines that will last unlike modern high-tech wines that do n't keep very long . " neighboring winegrowers agree .
" these steep hillsides here make for high cultivation and harvesting costs , " said peter mertes , a winegrower from wiltingen .
" everything has to be done manually .
to compete on the international market , we need something unique - and we can only achieve that via small harvests and high quality .

hans-josef becker uses many of the same techniques as his grandfather .
at the same time , he 's not afraid to tinker .
he was the first german grower to use glass stoppers instead of corks . " it 's really easy to remove the glass stopper , " becker said .
" and you can close it again so that you can put the bottle in the refrigerator . " becker decided to switch to glass stoppers because of the declining quality of natural corks : the more delicate a wine is , like the dry rieslings in his region , the more sensitive it is to unpleasant aftertastes or changes that can come about because of the cork .
the glass stoppers have helped avoid spoiled bottles and won over customers . back to basics there are a total of 13 wine-growing regions in germany : the largest ones , are along the rhine and neckar valleys in the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
but the region around the mosel , saar and ruwer valleys is also famous for its own light , dry white wine - the riesling . a century ago , this was the most expensive wine in the world .
but its reputation , particularly since 1985 , has been declining along with its export numbers .
now , that is beginning to change with a new generation of innovative vintners who want to return the reputation of old . roman niewodniczanski of van volxem vinyard is one of those growers .
he bought an old jesuit monastery in wiltingen on the saar river and completely renovated it - keeping only the wooden wine barrels .
just like in the past , the must - juice from the grapes - ferments in the barrels without any added ingredients . he also believes in going for quality over quantity .
in the past , the vineyards in the region tried to produce as much as possible and as a result , quality - and business - suffered . as a result , he gives his grapes as much sunshine and space as possible .
he is having his stock thinned out and the remaining grapes on the vine wo n't be harvested until november when they 've had the opportunity to soak up as much sun as possible . " if you try these grapes you 'll notice very strong exotic fruit flavors : apricot , passion fruit , papaya - lovely fruit combinations - and they produce fantastic wines , " he said . " we want to produce complex , hand-made wines that will last unlike modern high-tech wines that do n't keep very long . " neighboring winegrowers agree .
" these steep hillsides here make for high cultivation and harvesting costs , " said peter mertes , a winegrower from wiltingen .
" everything has to be done manually .
to compete on the international market , we need something unique - and we can only achieve that via small harvests and high quality .

" they will spend long periods of time at previously known places .
that makes this big event an attractive target for terrorists . " the world cup will attract politicians , royalty and celebrities from around the world and will be broadcast globally , making it an extremely high-profile target for terrorist groups wanting to attack international figures and have their atrocities publicized around the world . no compromises or reductions in police bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large police presence will be in evidence in germany freiberg was adamant that there should be no compromises made in securing germany ’ s world cup and that it would irresponsible to cut police numbers before the event . walter gagg , fifa 's director of stadiums and security , has made assurances that the security focus now is as much about preventing terrorism as hooliganism .

while we do n't want to consider every spectator a potential terrorist - at the same time we are aware it could be a wonderful platform for terrorists .

it arrived in britain from south america last month and had been held with a consignment of birds from taiwan , britain 's agriculture ministry said . the chief veterinary officer declined to speculate whether it had the lethal h5n1 strain , which has spread to romania and turkey . russian outbreak meanwhile , yet another avian flu outbreak was reported in russia , this time in the southern ural region of chelyabinsk , and among swans at a croatian lake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range chickens are being brought indoors in many places in moscow , the emergencies ministry said 31 birds in sunaly village in the chelyabinsk region had died , and in another six cases the diagnosis had been confirmed . a russian agriculture ministry official said friday the risk of the lethal strain occurring in moscow or surrounding area was minimal , despite an outbreak in tula , 300 kilometers -lrb- 190 miles -rrb- south of moscow . russian veterinary services said friday they suspected that the bird flu virus had now spread to 24 areas , including 20 in the novosibirsk region of siberia , three in the kurgan region one in the southern region of stavropol . the tula village of yandovka , where the lethal h5n1 strain of the virus which has killed 61 people in southeast asia since 2003 was found , has been quarantined for three weeks with all poultry there being killed and burned . meanwhile neighbouring ukraine slapped a six-month ban on poultry imports . swans in croatia croatia said further tests were needed to determine if the virus detected in the dead swans was the h5n1 strain , feared to be the precursor of a human pandemic , or more widespread form of epidemic , that could kill millions . the six swans were found in the lake at zdenci in eastern croatia , one of 20 sites croatian veterinary services have put under increased surveillance as part of a huge operation to take samples from wild birds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry is under strict surveillance the french agency for food safety , afssa , recommended increased scrutiny of wildlife , but stopped short of proposing poultry be confined . the united nations ' bird flu envoy flew into china friday where more than 91,000 birds have been destroyed to stamp out a new outbreak .

the boy had close contact with the virus -lrb- from being around sick chickens -rrb- and possibly from handling the birds ' excrement , " siriraj hospital director prasit watanapa said . the asian development bank said it would spend $ 58 million -lrb- 49 million euros -rrb- on two projects to help combat avian flu . european measures in romania , officials said a suspected new case of bird flu had been detected in the northeast only hours after assurances that the outbreak of the deadly h5n1 virus had been contained to two southeastern locations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian health workers have gassed infected domestic birds the world health organization -lrb- wto -rrb- warned against " scaremongering " but it also said each additional human case was making it easier to develop human-to-human transmission of the disease . the czech agriculture ministry banned sales of chickens in markets and exhibitions or sale of other birds in public places . the government of the principality of liechtenstein has banned rearing free range poultry for the next few months following a lead by neighbors austria , germany and switzerland . serious threat to africa migratory birds believed to be carriers may next take the virus to africa , the un 's food and agriculture organisation -lrb- fao -rrb- said , warning that the continent would be an " ideal breeding ground " because of close contact between people and animals . scientists have said ethiopia , kenya , tanzania and uganda were particularly threatened as they host millions of migratory fowl flying to warmer climes during the european winter . senegal - with west africa 's largest bird sanctuaries - asked people to take any poultry found dead to the nearest vet for inspection . the canadian government sought to reassure australia , which imported racing pigeons from canada carrying flu antibodies and subsequently banned canadian bird imports . australia has drawn up a bird flu battle plan including the possibility of holding airline passengers in quarantine in aircraft hangars for six days , a report said saturday . passengers arriving in australia would be subjected to thermal screening for fever and those on an aircraft found to be carrying someone suspected of having bird flu could be held at the airport quarantine centres , the sydney morning herald reported . the government plan would be put into operation if bird flu mutated into a human-to-human virus and posed the risk of a pandemic . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to hamper flu , germans lock up fowl as eu veterinarians meet to set a unified strategy to combat the spreading avian flu , germany took a drastic measure of its own : keeping farmed bird indoors in order to prevent infection from migrating ones .

it 's what most people throw onto a salad , but an increasing number of germans are also pouring this vegetable oil straight into their tanks as a substitute for diesel .
" it 's a bit better than the cold-pressed variety , if you 're using it for your car , " said lothar lauxen , a veggie-oil enthusiast .
" you can also use it for french fries if you want - the quality 's just as good . "
he has his own garage , and also runs a business supplying rapeseed oil .
he even drives around frankfurt in a car with his company 's motto plastered all over the vehicle in fluorescent green that says : " i drive on pure rapeseed oil . " just like making french fries he 's got every reason to be proud of himself .
conventional oil and diesel are getting ever more expensive , and bio-diesel is hard to get .
for the time being , the network of stations selling it is n't large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetable oils can be multi-purpose more motorists are following lauxen 's lead .
they buy rapeseed oil by the bottle from the local supermarket or , cheaper still , from a wholesaler .
then it 's just a matter of tipping it into the tank - just like filling up a vat for making french fries . of course , you have to put your car into the garage for conversion beforehand - at a cost of a couple of thousand euros .
" we converted 13 trucks for one of our customers , " said lauxen .
" he now saves 280,000 euros a year when filling up . "
an environmentally friendly alternative berthold haas is a self-employed electrician .
he 's dropped in to see lauxen and to buy his weekly dose of rapeseed oil . " i save two-thirds of what i used to pay to fill up a tank , " he said . the european union 's been pushing for the development of pure vegetable oils as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fuels for some time .
in some eu countries , they 're still banned .
critics say this is because governments miss out on the taxes that they usually rake in from standard fuels . not recommended in france , you can even get fined for using pure vegetable oil .
but according to distributors , a few thousand motorists do it anyway . the idea 's fast catching on in germany , too - especially among truck companies .
but the country 's main motoring organization , adac , does n't like the idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecological alternatives to diesel help clean up the motorways " it 's legal and there 's no problem using it to run a vehicle , but we do n't recommend it , " said ulrich buchmann from the adac .
damage can occur unless the right adjustments are made to diesel engines .
and the oil can pose other problems too . " you also ca n't claim for damages if anything goes wrong , " said buchmann .
" it 's also problematic in winter , as it starts to clog up at very cold temperatures . " a proven track record but veggie campaigners say that 's no problem , and point out that you just need to add a bit of diesel during the chillier months .
" we 've been running this business for more than two-and-a-half years , " said lauxen .
" our customers have done hundreds of thousands of kilometers on this stuff and have n't had any problems . "
commodity traders say the increasing trend for pure rapeseed oil among truck drivers , taxis and regular motorists is already evident , with production levels in germany suddenly reaching capacity earlier this season . rocketing prices market analyst martin schrah from the german firm zmp in bonn says another sign is that rapeseed oil prices have gone through the roof as a result of the strong demand .
" they 've jumped by about thirty percent in the last six months , " he said .
" many smaller farms have set up their own presses to produce the oil on location , either as a form of energy or for cooking oil . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to diesel have never been more popular he says the mills are working flat out , and still ca n't keep up with demand .
processors are now increasingly forced to look abroad to satisfy the growing hunger for vegetable oils in germany - whether it 's for cooking or taking the merc out for a spin . ben fajzullin -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fill it up with natural since fuel prices have hit the stratosphere , the search is on for alternatives to gasoline and diesel .

once seen as a key element in the reinvigoration of the national team , the fast-moving train has derailed .
his chances of playing for germany are sinking rapidly . huth was brought to england from berlin in 2001 .
at stamford bridge , the grounds of english premiership club chelsea , the fans call him the berlin wall , since he is something of a barricade that strikers must get around .
at 1.87 meters -lrb- 6 ft .

it 's what most people throw onto a salad , but an increasing number of germans are also pouring this vegetable oil straight into their tanks as a substitute for diesel .
" it 's a bit better than the cold-pressed variety , if you 're using it for your car , " said lothar lauxen , a veggie-oil enthusiast .
" you can also use it for french fries if you want - the quality 's just as good . "
he has his own garage , and also runs a business supplying rapeseed oil .
he even drives around frankfurt in a car with his company 's motto plastered all over the vehicle in fluorescent green that says : " i drive on pure rapeseed oil . " just like making french fries he 's got every reason to be proud of himself .
conventional oil and diesel are getting ever more expensive , and bio-diesel is hard to get .
for the time being , the network of stations selling it is n't large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetable oils can be multi-purpose more motorists are following lauxen 's lead .
they buy rapeseed oil by the bottle from the local supermarket or , cheaper still , from a wholesaler .
then it 's just a matter of tipping it into the tank - just like filling up a vat for making french fries . of course , you have to put your car into the garage for conversion beforehand - at a cost of a couple of thousand euros .
" we converted 13 trucks for one of our customers , " said lauxen .
" he now saves 280,000 euros a year when filling up . "
an environmentally friendly alternative berthold haas is a self-employed electrician .
he 's dropped in to see lauxen and to buy his weekly dose of rapeseed oil . " i save two-thirds of what i used to pay to fill up a tank , " he said . the european union 's been pushing for the development of pure vegetable oils as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fuels for some time .
in some eu countries , they 're still banned .
critics say this is because governments miss out on the taxes that they usually rake in from standard fuels . not recommended in france , you can even get fined for using pure vegetable oil .
but according to distributors , a few thousand motorists do it anyway . the idea 's fast catching on in germany , too - especially among truck companies .
but the country 's main motoring organization , adac , does n't like the idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecological alternatives to diesel help clean up the motorways " it 's legal and there 's no problem using it to run a vehicle , but we do n't recommend it , " said ulrich buchmann from the adac .
damage can occur unless the right adjustments are made to diesel engines .
and the oil can pose other problems too . " you also ca n't claim for damages if anything goes wrong , " said buchmann .
" it 's also problematic in winter , as it starts to clog up at very cold temperatures . " a proven track record but veggie campaigners say that 's no problem , and point out that you just need to add a bit of diesel during the chillier months .
" we 've been running this business for more than two-and-a-half years , " said lauxen .
" our customers have done hundreds of thousands of kilometers on this stuff and have n't had any problems . "
commodity traders say the increasing trend for pure rapeseed oil among truck drivers , taxis and regular motorists is already evident , with production levels in germany suddenly reaching capacity earlier this season . rocketing prices market analyst martin schrah from the german firm zmp in bonn says another sign is that rapeseed oil prices have gone through the roof as a result of the strong demand .
" they 've jumped by about thirty percent in the last six months , " he said .
" many smaller farms have set up their own presses to produce the oil on location , either as a form of energy or for cooking oil . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to diesel have never been more popular he says the mills are working flat out , and still ca n't keep up with demand .
processors are now increasingly forced to look abroad to satisfy the growing hunger for vegetable oils in germany - whether it 's for cooking or taking the merc out for a spin . ben fajzullin -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fill it up with natural since fuel prices have hit the stratosphere , the search is on for alternatives to gasoline and diesel .

while we do n't want to consider every spectator a potential terrorist - at the same time we are aware it could be a wonderful platform for terrorists . " fan violence more likely in cities meanwhile , freiberg added that with ticketless fans loitering in host cities and giant tv screens in public places providing sets of supporters with places to mingle , germany ’ s city centers will be under greater threat of violence than any of the stadiums in which the games will be played . bildunterschrift : huge screens in cities will attract rival fans to open spaces " for each england game alone 25,000 fans without tickets will be expected , " freiberg said .

once seen as a key element in the reinvigoration of the national team , the fast-moving train has derailed .
his chances of playing for germany are sinking rapidly . huth was brought to england from berlin in 2001 .
at stamford bridge , the grounds of english premiership club chelsea , the fans call him the berlin wall , since he is something of a barricade that strikers must get around .
at 1.87 meters -lrb- 6 ft .
3 in . -rrb- , he has the strength and size that any middle defender playing currently in top-level soccer needs . yet the berlin wall has been neglected lately in london .
the one-time cold war symbol became obsolete in 1989 , and huth 's services appear to be heading for the same fate at chelsea .
at the tender age of 21 , he is n't outdated yet , but is getting more and more acquainted with the feeling of the bench 's cold pine on his backside . appearances by huth -lrb- two late substitutions – eight minutes total -rrb- for the blues are almost as rare as losses for the english club , currently undefeated in the premiership . now huth is beginning to sing the blues .
he is determined to break through into the starting line-up of what is rapidly becoming one of europe 's most dominant teams . to stay or not to stay ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti -lrb- front -rrb- and huth at the confed cup " i 'm not going to let myself be pressured .
at the moment , i am not thinking about switching clubs , " he said during preparations for the most recent german friendlies against turkey and china .
he also mentioned that after a recent meeting with chelsea coach jose mourinho , he felt he still had a chance to make it into the starting line-up . german national coach jürgen klinsmann seems less than optimistic about huth ’ s chances of getting a break in the chelsea squad . " if people like ricardo carvalho -lrb- from portugal -rrb- and john terry -lrb- from england -rrb- are in front of robert huth , then you have to be a realist and say that he won ’ t get past two world-class defenders , " klinsmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches joachim löw and jürgen klinsmann -lrb- l. to r . -rrb-
the demand from klinsmann for all of the players who want to play next summer at the world cup in germany is clear : if you don ’ t play for your clubs , he 's let it be known , you wo n't be playing for him . another team might come into question last summer , huth played in his first big tournament for germany , the confederations cup .
the weak play on his part was strongly criticized by the soccer commentators .
the defensive unit as a whole performed poorly .
germany 's goalkeepers fetched the ball from the net 11 times in five games , an amazing fact considering that german teams are renowned if not for the prowess of their strikers , at least for having a rock-solid back line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life under chelsea coach mourinho has been less than optimal for huth to reduce the pressure on the young defender , he was asked to practice with the u-21 national club .
there is still time to play convincingly enough that he will remain part of the national squad , together with the other youthful members like podolski , schweinsteiger and mertesacker . but he has to play .
manfred schulte , huth 's agent , was cited on the sky sports homepage that huth would decide before christmas if he wants to transfer to another club .
schulte said that aston villa from birmingham would be a good fit for both club and player .
the british press confirmed that a transfer at the winter break was set . but bundesliga side schalke has also shown interest in the chelsea substitute .
could there be a switch from the blues of london to the royal blues in gelsenkirchen in the works ? schalke 's sport manager andreas müller told sport-bild magazine that huth is the kind of player that schalke needs at the moment .
to make things even more interesting , schulte said that he knew nothing about aston villa . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de podolski 's problem in the bundesliga bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .
both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .

17 , 2005 -rrb- old war horses return as young colts rest waves of anxiety rippled through germany 's soccer community on wednesday when coach jürgen klinsmann announced that his two youngest stars would not be in his latest squad .
could this be a return to the bad old days ?

once seen as a key element in the reinvigoration of the national team , the fast-moving train has derailed .
his chances of playing for germany are sinking rapidly . huth was brought to england from berlin in 2001 .
at stamford bridge , the grounds of english premiership club chelsea , the fans call him the berlin wall , since he is something of a barricade that strikers must get around .
at 1.87 meters -lrb- 6 ft .
3 in . -rrb- , he has the strength and size that any middle defender playing currently in top-level soccer needs . yet the berlin wall has been neglected lately in london .
the one-time cold war symbol became obsolete in 1989 , and huth 's services appear to be heading for the same fate at chelsea .
at the tender age of 21 , he is n't outdated yet , but is getting more and more acquainted with the feeling of the bench 's cold pine on his backside . appearances by huth -lrb- two late substitutions – eight minutes total -rrb- for the blues are almost as rare as losses for the english club , currently undefeated in the premiership . now huth is beginning to sing the blues .
he is determined to break through into the starting line-up of what is rapidly becoming one of europe 's most dominant teams . to stay or not to stay ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti -lrb- front -rrb- and huth at the confed cup " i 'm not going to let myself be pressured .
at the moment , i am not thinking about switching clubs , " he said during preparations for the most recent german friendlies against turkey and china .
he also mentioned that after a recent meeting with chelsea coach jose mourinho , he felt he still had a chance to make it into the starting line-up . german national coach jürgen klinsmann seems less than optimistic about huth ’ s chances of getting a break in the chelsea squad . " if people like ricardo carvalho -lrb- from portugal -rrb- and john terry -lrb- from england -rrb- are in front of robert huth , then you have to be a realist and say that he won ’ t get past two world-class defenders , " klinsmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches joachim löw and jürgen klinsmann -lrb- l. to r . -rrb-
the demand from klinsmann for all of the players who want to play next summer at the world cup in germany is clear : if you don ’ t play for your clubs , he 's let it be known , you wo n't be playing for him . another team might come into question last summer , huth played in his first big tournament for germany , the confederations cup .
the weak play on his part was strongly criticized by the soccer commentators .
the defensive unit as a whole performed poorly .
germany 's goalkeepers fetched the ball from the net 11 times in five games , an amazing fact considering that german teams are renowned if not for the prowess of their strikers , at least for having a rock-solid back line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life under chelsea coach mourinho has been less than optimal for huth to reduce the pressure on the young defender , he was asked to practice with the u-21 national club .
there is still time to play convincingly enough that he will remain part of the national squad , together with the other youthful members like podolski , schweinsteiger and mertesacker . but he has to play .
manfred schulte , huth 's agent , was cited on the sky sports homepage that huth would decide before christmas if he wants to transfer to another club .
schulte said that aston villa from birmingham would be a good fit for both club and player .
the british press confirmed that a transfer at the winter break was set . but bundesliga side schalke has also shown interest in the chelsea substitute .
could there be a switch from the blues of london to the royal blues in gelsenkirchen in the works ? schalke 's sport manager andreas müller told sport-bild magazine that huth is the kind of player that schalke needs at the moment .
to make things even more interesting , schulte said that he knew nothing about aston villa . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de podolski 's problem in the bundesliga bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .

while we do n't want to consider every spectator a potential terrorist - at the same time we are aware it could be a wonderful platform for terrorists . " fan violence more likely in cities meanwhile , freiberg added that with ticketless fans loitering in host cities and giant tv screens in public places providing sets of supporters with places to mingle , germany ’ s city centers will be under greater threat of violence than any of the stadiums in which the games will be played . bildunterschrift : huge screens in cities will attract rival fans to open spaces " for each england game alone 25,000 fans without tickets will be expected , " freiberg said .

the boy had close contact with the virus -lrb- from being around sick chickens -rrb- and possibly from handling the birds ' excrement , " siriraj hospital director prasit watanapa said . the asian development bank said it would spend $ 58 million -lrb- 49 million euros -rrb- on two projects to help combat avian flu . european measures in romania , officials said a suspected new case of bird flu had been detected in the northeast only hours after assurances that the outbreak of the deadly h5n1 virus had been contained to two southeastern locations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian health workers have gassed infected domestic birds the world health organization -lrb- wto -rrb- warned against " scaremongering " but it also said each additional human case was making it easier to develop human-to-human transmission of the disease . the czech agriculture ministry banned sales of chickens in markets and exhibitions or sale of other birds in public places . the government of the principality of liechtenstein has banned rearing free range poultry for the next few months following a lead by neighbors austria , germany and switzerland . serious threat to africa migratory birds believed to be carriers may next take the virus to africa , the un 's food and agriculture organisation -lrb- fao -rrb- said , warning that the continent would be an " ideal breeding ground " because of close contact between people and animals . scientists have said ethiopia , kenya , tanzania and uganda were particularly threatened as they host millions of migratory fowl flying to warmer climes during the european winter . senegal - with west africa 's largest bird sanctuaries - asked people to take any poultry found dead to the nearest vet for inspection . the canadian government sought to reassure australia , which imported racing pigeons from canada carrying flu antibodies and subsequently banned canadian bird imports . australia has drawn up a bird flu battle plan including the possibility of holding airline passengers in quarantine in aircraft hangars for six days , a report said saturday . passengers arriving in australia would be subjected to thermal screening for fever and those on an aircraft found to be carrying someone suspected of having bird flu could be held at the airport quarantine centres , the sydney morning herald reported . the government plan would be put into operation if bird flu mutated into a human-to-human virus and posed the risk of a pandemic . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to hamper flu , germans lock up fowl as eu veterinarians meet to set a unified strategy to combat the spreading avian flu , germany took a drastic measure of its own : keeping farmed bird indoors in order to prevent infection from migrating ones .

once seen as a key element in the reinvigoration of the national team , the fast-moving train has derailed .
his chances of playing for germany are sinking rapidly . huth was brought to england from berlin in 2001 .
at stamford bridge , the grounds of english premiership club chelsea , the fans call him the berlin wall , since he is something of a barricade that strikers must get around .
at 1.87 meters -lrb- 6 ft .
3 in . -rrb- , he has the strength and size that any middle defender playing currently in top-level soccer needs . yet the berlin wall has been neglected lately in london .
the one-time cold war symbol became obsolete in 1989 , and huth 's services appear to be heading for the same fate at chelsea .
at the tender age of 21 , he is n't outdated yet , but is getting more and more acquainted with the feeling of the bench 's cold pine on his backside . appearances by huth -lrb- two late substitutions – eight minutes total -rrb- for the blues are almost as rare as losses for the english club , currently undefeated in the premiership . now huth is beginning to sing the blues .
he is determined to break through into the starting line-up of what is rapidly becoming one of europe 's most dominant teams . to stay or not to stay ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti -lrb- front -rrb- and huth at the confed cup " i 'm not going to let myself be pressured .
at the moment , i am not thinking about switching clubs , " he said during preparations for the most recent german friendlies against turkey and china .
he also mentioned that after a recent meeting with chelsea coach jose mourinho , he felt he still had a chance to make it into the starting line-up . german national coach jürgen klinsmann seems less than optimistic about huth ’ s chances of getting a break in the chelsea squad . " if people like ricardo carvalho -lrb- from portugal -rrb- and john terry -lrb- from england -rrb- are in front of robert huth , then you have to be a realist and say that he won ’ t get past two world-class defenders , " klinsmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches joachim löw and jürgen klinsmann -lrb- l. to r . -rrb-
the demand from klinsmann for all of the players who want to play next summer at the world cup in germany is clear : if you don ’ t play for your clubs , he 's let it be known , you wo n't be playing for him . another team might come into question last summer , huth played in his first big tournament for germany , the confederations cup .
the weak play on his part was strongly criticized by the soccer commentators .
the defensive unit as a whole performed poorly .
germany 's goalkeepers fetched the ball from the net 11 times in five games , an amazing fact considering that german teams are renowned if not for the prowess of their strikers , at least for having a rock-solid back line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life under chelsea coach mourinho has been less than optimal for huth to reduce the pressure on the young defender , he was asked to practice with the u-21 national club .
there is still time to play convincingly enough that he will remain part of the national squad , together with the other youthful members like podolski , schweinsteiger and mertesacker . but he has to play .
manfred schulte , huth 's agent , was cited on the sky sports homepage that huth would decide before christmas if he wants to transfer to another club .
schulte said that aston villa from birmingham would be a good fit for both club and player .
the british press confirmed that a transfer at the winter break was set . but bundesliga side schalke has also shown interest in the chelsea substitute .
could there be a switch from the blues of london to the royal blues in gelsenkirchen in the works ? schalke 's sport manager andreas müller told sport-bild magazine that huth is the kind of player that schalke needs at the moment .
to make things even more interesting , schulte said that he knew nothing about aston villa . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de podolski 's problem in the bundesliga bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .
both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem .

17 , 2005 -rrb- old war horses return as young colts rest waves of anxiety rippled through germany 's soccer community on wednesday when coach jürgen klinsmann announced that his two youngest stars would not be in his latest squad .
could this be a return to the bad old days ?
-lrb- aug .
10 , 2005 -rrb- germany lacking bricks in defensive wall germany kick-off their confederations cup campaign on wednesday with high hopes of lifting the cup on june 29 .
but as dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies writes , a defensive flaw may end the dream before the final .

" becker decided to switch to glass stoppers because of the declining quality of natural corks : the more delicate a wine is , like the dry rieslings in his region , the more sensitive it is to unpleasant aftertastes or changes that can come about because of the cork .

it arrived in britain from south america last month and had been held with a consignment of birds from taiwan , britain 's agriculture ministry said . the chief veterinary officer declined to speculate whether it had the lethal h5n1 strain , which has spread to romania and turkey . russian outbreak meanwhile , yet another avian flu outbreak was reported in russia , this time in the southern ural region of chelyabinsk , and among swans at a croatian lake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range chickens are being brought indoors in many places in moscow , the emergencies ministry said 31 birds in sunaly village in the chelyabinsk region had died , and in another six cases the diagnosis had been confirmed . a russian agriculture ministry official said friday the risk of the lethal strain occurring in moscow or surrounding area was minimal , despite an outbreak in tula , 300 kilometers -lrb- 190 miles -rrb- south of moscow . russian veterinary services said friday they suspected that the bird flu virus had now spread to 24 areas , including 20 in the novosibirsk region of siberia , three in the kurgan region one in the southern region of stavropol . the tula village of yandovka , where the lethal h5n1 strain of the virus which has killed 61 people in southeast asia since 2003 was found , has been quarantined for three weeks with all poultry there being killed and burned . meanwhile neighbouring ukraine slapped a six-month ban on poultry imports . swans in croatia croatia said further tests were needed to determine if the virus detected in the dead swans was the h5n1 strain , feared to be the precursor of a human pandemic , or more widespread form of epidemic , that could kill millions . the six swans were found in the lake at zdenci in eastern croatia , one of 20 sites croatian veterinary services have put under increased surveillance as part of a huge operation to take samples from wild birds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry is under strict surveillance the french agency for food safety , afssa , recommended increased scrutiny of wildlife , but stopped short of proposing poultry be confined . the united nations ' bird flu envoy flew into china friday where more than 91,000 birds have been destroyed to stamp out a new outbreak .

" fan violence more likely in cities meanwhile , freiberg added that with ticketless fans loitering in host cities and giant tv screens in public places providing sets of supporters with places to mingle , germany ’ s city centers will be under greater threat of violence than any of the stadiums in which the games will be played . bildunterschrift : huge screens in cities will attract rival fans to open spaces " for each england game alone 25,000 fans without tickets will be expected , " freiberg said .

once seen as a key element in the reinvigoration of the national team , the fast-moving train has derailed .
his chances of playing for germany are sinking rapidly . huth was brought to england from berlin in 2001 .
at stamford bridge , the grounds of english premiership club chelsea , the fans call him the berlin wall , since he is something of a barricade that strikers must get around .
at 1.87 meters -lrb- 6 ft .
3 in . -rrb- , he has the strength and size that any middle defender playing currently in top-level soccer needs . yet the berlin wall has been neglected lately in london .
the one-time cold war symbol became obsolete in 1989 , and huth 's services appear to be heading for the same fate at chelsea .
at the tender age of 21 , he is n't outdated yet , but is getting more and more acquainted with the feeling of the bench 's cold pine on his backside . appearances by huth -lrb- two late substitutions – eight minutes total -rrb- for the blues are almost as rare as losses for the english club , currently undefeated in the premiership . now huth is beginning to sing the blues .
he is determined to break through into the starting line-up of what is rapidly becoming one of europe 's most dominant teams . to stay or not to stay ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti -lrb- front -rrb- and huth at the confed cup " i 'm not going to let myself be pressured .
at the moment , i am not thinking about switching clubs , " he said during preparations for the most recent german friendlies against turkey and china .
he also mentioned that after a recent meeting with chelsea coach jose mourinho , he felt he still had a chance to make it into the starting line-up . german national coach jürgen klinsmann seems less than optimistic about huth ’ s chances of getting a break in the chelsea squad . " if people like ricardo carvalho -lrb- from portugal -rrb- and john terry -lrb- from england -rrb- are in front of robert huth , then you have to be a realist and say that he won ’ t get past two world-class defenders , " klinsmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches joachim löw and jürgen klinsmann -lrb- l. to r . -rrb-
the demand from klinsmann for all of the players who want to play next summer at the world cup in germany is clear : if you don ’ t play for your clubs , he 's let it be known , you wo n't be playing for him . another team might come into question last summer , huth played in his first big tournament for germany , the confederations cup .
the weak play on his part was strongly criticized by the soccer commentators .
the defensive unit as a whole performed poorly .
germany 's goalkeepers fetched the ball from the net 11 times in five games , an amazing fact considering that german teams are renowned if not for the prowess of their strikers , at least for having a rock-solid back line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life under chelsea coach mourinho has been less than optimal for huth to reduce the pressure on the young defender , he was asked to practice with the u-21 national club .
there is still time to play convincingly enough that he will remain part of the national squad , together with the other youthful members like podolski , schweinsteiger and mertesacker . but he has to play .
manfred schulte , huth 's agent , was cited on the sky sports homepage that huth would decide before christmas if he wants to transfer to another club .
schulte said that aston villa from birmingham would be a good fit for both club and player .
the british press confirmed that a transfer at the winter break was set . but bundesliga side schalke has also shown interest in the chelsea substitute .
could there be a switch from the blues of london to the royal blues in gelsenkirchen in the works ? schalke 's sport manager andreas müller told sport-bild magazine that huth is the kind of player that schalke needs at the moment .
to make things even more interesting , schulte said that he knew nothing about aston villa . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de podolski 's problem in the bundesliga bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .

his chances of playing for germany are sinking rapidly . huth was brought to england from berlin in 2001 .
at stamford bridge , the grounds of english premiership club chelsea , the fans call him the berlin wall , since he is something of a barricade that strikers must get around .
at 1.87 meters -lrb- 6 ft .
3 in . -rrb- , he has the strength and size that any middle defender playing currently in top-level soccer needs . yet the berlin wall has been neglected lately in london .
the one-time cold war symbol became obsolete in 1989 , and huth 's services appear to be heading for the same fate at chelsea .
at the tender age of 21 , he is n't outdated yet , but is getting more and more acquainted with the feeling of the bench 's cold pine on his backside . appearances by huth -lrb- two late substitutions – eight minutes total -rrb- for the blues are almost as rare as losses for the english club , currently undefeated in the premiership . now huth is beginning to sing the blues .
he is determined to break through into the starting line-up of what is rapidly becoming one of europe 's most dominant teams . to stay or not to stay ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti -lrb- front -rrb- and huth at the confed cup " i 'm not going to let myself be pressured .
at the moment , i am not thinking about switching clubs , " he said during preparations for the most recent german friendlies against turkey and china .
he also mentioned that after a recent meeting with chelsea coach jose mourinho , he felt he still had a chance to make it into the starting line-up . german national coach jürgen klinsmann seems less than optimistic about huth ’ s chances of getting a break in the chelsea squad . " if people like ricardo carvalho -lrb- from portugal -rrb- and john terry -lrb- from england -rrb- are in front of robert huth , then you have to be a realist and say that he won ’ t get past two world-class defenders , " klinsmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches joachim löw and jürgen klinsmann -lrb- l. to r . -rrb-
the demand from klinsmann for all of the players who want to play next summer at the world cup in germany is clear : if you don ’ t play for your clubs , he 's let it be known , you wo n't be playing for him . another team might come into question last summer , huth played in his first big tournament for germany , the confederations cup .
the weak play on his part was strongly criticized by the soccer commentators .
the defensive unit as a whole performed poorly .
germany 's goalkeepers fetched the ball from the net 11 times in five games , an amazing fact considering that german teams are renowned if not for the prowess of their strikers , at least for having a rock-solid back line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life under chelsea coach mourinho has been less than optimal for huth to reduce the pressure on the young defender , he was asked to practice with the u-21 national club .
there is still time to play convincingly enough that he will remain part of the national squad , together with the other youthful members like podolski , schweinsteiger and mertesacker . but he has to play .
manfred schulte , huth 's agent , was cited on the sky sports homepage that huth would decide before christmas if he wants to transfer to another club .
schulte said that aston villa from birmingham would be a good fit for both club and player .
the british press confirmed that a transfer at the winter break was set . but bundesliga side schalke has also shown interest in the chelsea substitute .
could there be a switch from the blues of london to the royal blues in gelsenkirchen in the works ? schalke 's sport manager andreas müller told sport-bild magazine that huth is the kind of player that schalke needs at the moment .
to make things even more interesting , schulte said that he knew nothing about aston villa . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de podolski 's problem in the bundesliga bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .
both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem .
-lrb- sept .
17 , 2005 -rrb- old war horses return as young colts rest waves of anxiety rippled through germany 's soccer community on wednesday when coach jürgen klinsmann announced that his two youngest stars would not be in his latest squad .
could this be a return to the bad old days ?
-lrb- aug .
10 , 2005 -rrb- germany lacking bricks in defensive wall germany kick-off their confederations cup campaign on wednesday with high hopes of lifting the cup on june 29 .
but as dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies writes , a defensive flaw may end the dream before the final .

but hammond is willing to experiment and calls his vineyard the " garage winery . " " people expect something different from me , " he said .
" i have to present something different , something that people think is interesting and that they want to taste and hopefully buy . " germany is the world 's 9th biggest wine grower , and about a quarter of its wines are sold abroad .
britons bought 97 million liters last year and even the french bought 11.2 million liters . even so , new players have been joining the world wine market , which is forcing germans producers to place quality over quantity in order to compete .
but even very high quality is n't always enough .
vineyards often have to come up with unique selling points to establish themselves on the world market , say experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quality beats quantity these days " germany imports more wine than anywhere else , " said ingo swoboda , a wine critic and author .
" that 's why it 's important for growers to have their own image - a german image for german wine .
they also need new ideas to keep up with competitors from overseas . " innovation a hit the rheingau region is at the heart of the german wine industry , which has flourished here for a thousand years .
but increasingly , new names and new products are making their way onto the market .
those include a sort-of riesling-prosecco described by its makers as " frivolous . "
some 20 young growers are involved in its production . " back when we started , the older generation of growers snickered at us and doubted we 'd be successful , " said vintner frank nikolai .
" they could n't believe we wanted to launch the idea together . " their creation has been a hit .
each of the growers contributes part of their riesling harvest to the joint effort .
production is subject to strict quality controls and judges make sure that only wines that meet the standards are used to make the prosecco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : innovation popular in the traditional art embracing new trends does n't mean having to forego tradition .
hans-josef becker uses many of the same techniques as his grandfather .
at the same time , he 's not afraid to tinker .
he was the first german grower to use glass stoppers instead of corks . " it 's really easy to remove the glass stopper , " becker said .
" and you can close it again so that you can put the bottle in the refrigerator . " becker decided to switch to glass stoppers because of the declining quality of natural corks : the more delicate a wine is , like the dry rieslings in his region , the more sensitive it is to unpleasant aftertastes or changes that can come about because of the cork .
the glass stoppers have helped avoid spoiled bottles and won over customers . back to basics there are a total of 13 wine-growing regions in germany : the largest ones , are along the rhine and neckar valleys in the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
but the region around the mosel , saar and ruwer valleys is also famous for its own light , dry white wine - the riesling . a century ago , this was the most expensive wine in the world .
but its reputation , particularly since 1985 , has been declining along with its export numbers .
now , that is beginning to change with a new generation of innovative vintners who want to return the reputation of old . roman niewodniczanski of van volxem vinyard is one of those growers .
he bought an old jesuit monastery in wiltingen on the saar river and completely renovated it - keeping only the wooden wine barrels .
just like in the past , the must - juice from the grapes - ferments in the barrels without any added ingredients . he also believes in going for quality over quantity .
in the past , the vineyards in the region tried to produce as much as possible and as a result , quality - and business - suffered . as a result , he gives his grapes as much sunshine and space as possible .
he is having his stock thinned out and the remaining grapes on the vine wo n't be harvested until november when they 've had the opportunity to soak up as much sun as possible . " if you try these grapes you 'll notice very strong exotic fruit flavors : apricot , passion fruit , papaya - lovely fruit combinations - and they produce fantastic wines , " he said . " we want to produce complex , hand-made wines that will last unlike modern high-tech wines that do n't keep very long . " neighboring winegrowers agree .
" these steep hillsides here make for high cultivation and harvesting costs , " said peter mertes , a winegrower from wiltingen .
" everything has to be done manually .
to compete on the international market , we need something unique - and we can only achieve that via small harvests and high quality .

once seen as a key element in the reinvigoration of the national team , the fast-moving train has derailed .
his chances of playing for germany are sinking rapidly . huth was brought to england from berlin in 2001 .
at stamford bridge , the grounds of english premiership club chelsea , the fans call him the berlin wall , since he is something of a barricade that strikers must get around .
at 1.87 meters -lrb- 6 ft .
3 in . -rrb- , he has the strength and size that any middle defender playing currently in top-level soccer needs . yet the berlin wall has been neglected lately in london .
the one-time cold war symbol became obsolete in 1989 , and huth 's services appear to be heading for the same fate at chelsea .
at the tender age of 21 , he is n't outdated yet , but is getting more and more acquainted with the feeling of the bench 's cold pine on his backside . appearances by huth -lrb- two late substitutions – eight minutes total -rrb- for the blues are almost as rare as losses for the english club , currently undefeated in the premiership . now huth is beginning to sing the blues .
he is determined to break through into the starting line-up of what is rapidly becoming one of europe 's most dominant teams . to stay or not to stay ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti -lrb- front -rrb- and huth at the confed cup " i 'm not going to let myself be pressured .
at the moment , i am not thinking about switching clubs , " he said during preparations for the most recent german friendlies against turkey and china .
he also mentioned that after a recent meeting with chelsea coach jose mourinho , he felt he still had a chance to make it into the starting line-up . german national coach jürgen klinsmann seems less than optimistic about huth ’ s chances of getting a break in the chelsea squad . " if people like ricardo carvalho -lrb- from portugal -rrb- and john terry -lrb- from england -rrb- are in front of robert huth , then you have to be a realist and say that he won ’ t get past two world-class defenders , " klinsmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches joachim löw and jürgen klinsmann -lrb- l. to r . -rrb-
the demand from klinsmann for all of the players who want to play next summer at the world cup in germany is clear : if you don ’ t play for your clubs , he 's let it be known , you wo n't be playing for him . another team might come into question last summer , huth played in his first big tournament for germany , the confederations cup .
the weak play on his part was strongly criticized by the soccer commentators .
the defensive unit as a whole performed poorly .
germany 's goalkeepers fetched the ball from the net 11 times in five games , an amazing fact considering that german teams are renowned if not for the prowess of their strikers , at least for having a rock-solid back line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life under chelsea coach mourinho has been less than optimal for huth to reduce the pressure on the young defender , he was asked to practice with the u-21 national club .
there is still time to play convincingly enough that he will remain part of the national squad , together with the other youthful members like podolski , schweinsteiger and mertesacker . but he has to play .
manfred schulte , huth 's agent , was cited on the sky sports homepage that huth would decide before christmas if he wants to transfer to another club .
schulte said that aston villa from birmingham would be a good fit for both club and player .
the british press confirmed that a transfer at the winter break was set . but bundesliga side schalke has also shown interest in the chelsea substitute .
could there be a switch from the blues of london to the royal blues in gelsenkirchen in the works ? schalke 's sport manager andreas müller told sport-bild magazine that huth is the kind of player that schalke needs at the moment .
to make things even more interesting , schulte said that he knew nothing about aston villa . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de podolski 's problem in the bundesliga bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .

manfred schulte , huth 's agent , was cited on the sky sports homepage that huth would decide before christmas if he wants to transfer to another club .
schulte said that aston villa from birmingham would be a good fit for both club and player .
the british press confirmed that a transfer at the winter break was set . but bundesliga side schalke has also shown interest in the chelsea substitute .
could there be a switch from the blues of london to the royal blues in gelsenkirchen in the works ? schalke 's sport manager andreas müller told sport-bild magazine that huth is the kind of player that schalke needs at the moment .

but hammond is willing to experiment and calls his vineyard the " garage winery . " " people expect something different from me , " he said .
" i have to present something different , something that people think is interesting and that they want to taste and hopefully buy . " germany is the world 's 9th biggest wine grower , and about a quarter of its wines are sold abroad .
britons bought 97 million liters last year and even the french bought 11.2 million liters . even so , new players have been joining the world wine market , which is forcing germans producers to place quality over quantity in order to compete .
but even very high quality is n't always enough .
vineyards often have to come up with unique selling points to establish themselves on the world market , say experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quality beats quantity these days " germany imports more wine than anywhere else , " said ingo swoboda , a wine critic and author .
" that 's why it 's important for growers to have their own image - a german image for german wine .
they also need new ideas to keep up with competitors from overseas . " innovation a hit the rheingau region is at the heart of the german wine industry , which has flourished here for a thousand years .
but increasingly , new names and new products are making their way onto the market .
those include a sort-of riesling-prosecco described by its makers as " frivolous . "
some 20 young growers are involved in its production . " back when we started , the older generation of growers snickered at us and doubted we 'd be successful , " said vintner frank nikolai .
" they could n't believe we wanted to launch the idea together . " their creation has been a hit .
each of the growers contributes part of their riesling harvest to the joint effort .
production is subject to strict quality controls and judges make sure that only wines that meet the standards are used to make the prosecco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : innovation popular in the traditional art embracing new trends does n't mean having to forego tradition .
hans-josef becker uses many of the same techniques as his grandfather .
at the same time , he 's not afraid to tinker .
he was the first german grower to use glass stoppers instead of corks . " it 's really easy to remove the glass stopper , " becker said .
" and you can close it again so that you can put the bottle in the refrigerator . " becker decided to switch to glass stoppers because of the declining quality of natural corks : the more delicate a wine is , like the dry rieslings in his region , the more sensitive it is to unpleasant aftertastes or changes that can come about because of the cork .
the glass stoppers have helped avoid spoiled bottles and won over customers . back to basics there are a total of 13 wine-growing regions in germany : the largest ones , are along the rhine and neckar valleys in the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
but the region around the mosel , saar and ruwer valleys is also famous for its own light , dry white wine - the riesling . a century ago , this was the most expensive wine in the world .
but its reputation , particularly since 1985 , has been declining along with its export numbers .
now , that is beginning to change with a new generation of innovative vintners who want to return the reputation of old . roman niewodniczanski of van volxem vinyard is one of those growers .
he bought an old jesuit monastery in wiltingen on the saar river and completely renovated it - keeping only the wooden wine barrels .
just like in the past , the must - juice from the grapes - ferments in the barrels without any added ingredients . he also believes in going for quality over quantity .
in the past , the vineyards in the region tried to produce as much as possible and as a result , quality - and business - suffered . as a result , he gives his grapes as much sunshine and space as possible .
he is having his stock thinned out and the remaining grapes on the vine wo n't be harvested until november when they 've had the opportunity to soak up as much sun as possible . " if you try these grapes you 'll notice very strong exotic fruit flavors : apricot , passion fruit , papaya - lovely fruit combinations - and they produce fantastic wines , " he said . " we want to produce complex , hand-made wines that will last unlike modern high-tech wines that do n't keep very long . " neighboring winegrowers agree .
" these steep hillsides here make for high cultivation and harvesting costs , " said peter mertes , a winegrower from wiltingen .
" everything has to be done manually .
to compete on the international market , we need something unique - and we can only achieve that via small harvests and high quality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.10.2005 of fast cars and french fries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roaring ahead with rapeseed oil with the cost of crude oil continuing to climb , an increasing number of consumers and companies are running their vehicles on cooking oil - but the country 's motoring body says this could be dangerous . who cares about the price of petrol , when you can take matters into your own hands and simply use rapeseed oil ?
it 's what most people throw onto a salad , but an increasing number of germans are also pouring this vegetable oil straight into their tanks as a substitute for diesel .
" it 's a bit better than the cold-pressed variety , if you 're using it for your car , " said lothar lauxen , a veggie-oil enthusiast .
" you can also use it for french fries if you want - the quality 's just as good . "
he has his own garage , and also runs a business supplying rapeseed oil .
he even drives around frankfurt in a car with his company 's motto plastered all over the vehicle in fluorescent green that says : " i drive on pure rapeseed oil . " just like making french fries he 's got every reason to be proud of himself .
conventional oil and diesel are getting ever more expensive , and bio-diesel is hard to get .
for the time being , the network of stations selling it is n't large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetable oils can be multi-purpose more motorists are following lauxen 's lead .
they buy rapeseed oil by the bottle from the local supermarket or , cheaper still , from a wholesaler .
then it 's just a matter of tipping it into the tank - just like filling up a vat for making french fries . of course , you have to put your car into the garage for conversion beforehand - at a cost of a couple of thousand euros .
" we converted 13 trucks for one of our customers , " said lauxen .
" he now saves 280,000 euros a year when filling up . "
an environmentally friendly alternative berthold haas is a self-employed electrician .
he 's dropped in to see lauxen and to buy his weekly dose of rapeseed oil . " i save two-thirds of what i used to pay to fill up a tank , " he said . the european union 's been pushing for the development of pure vegetable oils as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fuels for some time .
in some eu countries , they 're still banned .
critics say this is because governments miss out on the taxes that they usually rake in from standard fuels . not recommended in france , you can even get fined for using pure vegetable oil .
but according to distributors , a few thousand motorists do it anyway . the idea 's fast catching on in germany , too - especially among truck companies .
but the country 's main motoring organization , adac , does n't like the idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecological alternatives to diesel help clean up the motorways " it 's legal and there 's no problem using it to run a vehicle , but we do n't recommend it , " said ulrich buchmann from the adac .
damage can occur unless the right adjustments are made to diesel engines .
and the oil can pose other problems too . " you also ca n't claim for damages if anything goes wrong , " said buchmann .
" it 's also problematic in winter , as it starts to clog up at very cold temperatures . " a proven track record but veggie campaigners say that 's no problem , and point out that you just need to add a bit of diesel during the chillier months .
" we 've been running this business for more than two-and-a-half years , " said lauxen .
" our customers have done hundreds of thousands of kilometers on this stuff and have n't had any problems . "
commodity traders say the increasing trend for pure rapeseed oil among truck drivers , taxis and regular motorists is already evident , with production levels in germany suddenly reaching capacity earlier this season . rocketing prices market analyst martin schrah from the german firm zmp in bonn says another sign is that rapeseed oil prices have gone through the roof as a result of the strong demand .
" they 've jumped by about thirty percent in the last six months , " he said .
" many smaller farms have set up their own presses to produce the oil on location , either as a form of energy or for cooking oil . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to diesel have never been more popular he says the mills are working flat out , and still ca n't keep up with demand .
processors are now increasingly forced to look abroad to satisfy the growing hunger for vegetable oils in germany - whether it 's for cooking or taking the merc out for a spin . ben fajzullin -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fill it up with natural since fuel prices have hit the stratosphere , the search is on for alternatives to gasoline and diesel .

he even drives around frankfurt in a car with his company 's motto plastered all over the vehicle in fluorescent green that says : " i drive on pure rapeseed oil . " just like making french fries he 's got every reason to be proud of himself .
conventional oil and diesel are getting ever more expensive , and bio-diesel is hard to get .
for the time being , the network of stations selling it is n't large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetable oils can be multi-purpose more motorists are following lauxen 's lead .
they buy rapeseed oil by the bottle from the local supermarket or , cheaper still , from a wholesaler .
then it 's just a matter of tipping it into the tank - just like filling up a vat for making french fries . of course , you have to put your car into the garage for conversion beforehand - at a cost of a couple of thousand euros .
" we converted 13 trucks for one of our customers , " said lauxen .
" he now saves 280,000 euros a year when filling up . "
an environmentally friendly alternative berthold haas is a self-employed electrician .
he 's dropped in to see lauxen and to buy his weekly dose of rapeseed oil . " i save two-thirds of what i used to pay to fill up a tank , " he said . the european union 's been pushing for the development of pure vegetable oils as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fuels for some time .
in some eu countries , they 're still banned .
critics say this is because governments miss out on the taxes that they usually rake in from standard fuels . not recommended in france , you can even get fined for using pure vegetable oil .
but according to distributors , a few thousand motorists do it anyway . the idea 's fast catching on in germany , too - especially among truck companies .
but the country 's main motoring organization , adac , does n't like the idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecological alternatives to diesel help clean up the motorways " it 's legal and there 's no problem using it to run a vehicle , but we do n't recommend it , " said ulrich buchmann from the adac .
damage can occur unless the right adjustments are made to diesel engines .
and the oil can pose other problems too . " you also ca n't claim for damages if anything goes wrong , " said buchmann .
" it 's also problematic in winter , as it starts to clog up at very cold temperatures . " a proven track record but veggie campaigners say that 's no problem , and point out that you just need to add a bit of diesel during the chillier months .
" we 've been running this business for more than two-and-a-half years , " said lauxen .
" our customers have done hundreds of thousands of kilometers on this stuff and have n't had any problems . "
commodity traders say the increasing trend for pure rapeseed oil among truck drivers , taxis and regular motorists is already evident , with production levels in germany suddenly reaching capacity earlier this season . rocketing prices market analyst martin schrah from the german firm zmp in bonn says another sign is that rapeseed oil prices have gone through the roof as a result of the strong demand .
" they 've jumped by about thirty percent in the last six months , " he said .
" many smaller farms have set up their own presses to produce the oil on location , either as a form of energy or for cooking oil . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to diesel have never been more popular he says the mills are working flat out , and still ca n't keep up with demand .
processors are now increasingly forced to look abroad to satisfy the growing hunger for vegetable oils in germany - whether it 's for cooking or taking the merc out for a spin . ben fajzullin -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fill it up with natural since fuel prices have hit the stratosphere , the search is on for alternatives to gasoline and diesel .

but hammond is willing to experiment and calls his vineyard the " garage winery . " " people expect something different from me , " he said .
" i have to present something different , something that people think is interesting and that they want to taste and hopefully buy . " germany is the world 's 9th biggest wine grower , and about a quarter of its wines are sold abroad .
britons bought 97 million liters last year and even the french bought 11.2 million liters . even so , new players have been joining the world wine market , which is forcing germans producers to place quality over quantity in order to compete .
but even very high quality is n't always enough .
vineyards often have to come up with unique selling points to establish themselves on the world market , say experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quality beats quantity these days " germany imports more wine than anywhere else , " said ingo swoboda , a wine critic and author .
" that 's why it 's important for growers to have their own image - a german image for german wine .
they also need new ideas to keep up with competitors from overseas . " innovation a hit the rheingau region is at the heart of the german wine industry , which has flourished here for a thousand years .
but increasingly , new names and new products are making their way onto the market .
those include a sort-of riesling-prosecco described by its makers as " frivolous . "
some 20 young growers are involved in its production . " back when we started , the older generation of growers snickered at us and doubted we 'd be successful , " said vintner frank nikolai .
" they could n't believe we wanted to launch the idea together . " their creation has been a hit .
each of the growers contributes part of their riesling harvest to the joint effort .
production is subject to strict quality controls and judges make sure that only wines that meet the standards are used to make the prosecco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : innovation popular in the traditional art embracing new trends does n't mean having to forego tradition .
hans-josef becker uses many of the same techniques as his grandfather .
at the same time , he 's not afraid to tinker .
he was the first german grower to use glass stoppers instead of corks . " it 's really easy to remove the glass stopper , " becker said .
" and you can close it again so that you can put the bottle in the refrigerator . " becker decided to switch to glass stoppers because of the declining quality of natural corks : the more delicate a wine is , like the dry rieslings in his region , the more sensitive it is to unpleasant aftertastes or changes that can come about because of the cork .
the glass stoppers have helped avoid spoiled bottles and won over customers . back to basics there are a total of 13 wine-growing regions in germany : the largest ones , are along the rhine and neckar valleys in the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
but the region around the mosel , saar and ruwer valleys is also famous for its own light , dry white wine - the riesling . a century ago , this was the most expensive wine in the world .
but its reputation , particularly since 1985 , has been declining along with its export numbers .
now , that is beginning to change with a new generation of innovative vintners who want to return the reputation of old . roman niewodniczanski of van volxem vinyard is one of those growers .
he bought an old jesuit monastery in wiltingen on the saar river and completely renovated it - keeping only the wooden wine barrels .
just like in the past , the must - juice from the grapes - ferments in the barrels without any added ingredients . he also believes in going for quality over quantity .
in the past , the vineyards in the region tried to produce as much as possible and as a result , quality - and business - suffered . as a result , he gives his grapes as much sunshine and space as possible .
he is having his stock thinned out and the remaining grapes on the vine wo n't be harvested until november when they 've had the opportunity to soak up as much sun as possible . " if you try these grapes you 'll notice very strong exotic fruit flavors : apricot , passion fruit , papaya - lovely fruit combinations - and they produce fantastic wines , " he said . " we want to produce complex , hand-made wines that will last unlike modern high-tech wines that do n't keep very long . " neighboring winegrowers agree .
" these steep hillsides here make for high cultivation and harvesting costs , " said peter mertes , a winegrower from wiltingen .
" everything has to be done manually .
to compete on the international market , we need something unique - and we can only achieve that via small harvests and high quality .

fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds europe -pipe- 22.10.2005 bird flu moves west großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bird flu scare in greece brought eu inspectors to a farm this week a parrot imported from latin america has become the first bird to die of bird flu in britain , bringing the danger of the virus much further west across the european union as the battle against the disease continues . officials confirmed cases of the virus found in the parrot from surinam , which died in british quarantine . the parrot tested positive for the h5 strain of the bird flu virus .
it arrived in britain from south america last month and had been held with a consignment of birds from taiwan , britain 's agriculture ministry said . the chief veterinary officer declined to speculate whether it had the lethal h5n1 strain , which has spread to romania and turkey . russian outbreak meanwhile , yet another avian flu outbreak was reported in russia , this time in the southern ural region of chelyabinsk , and among swans at a croatian lake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range chickens are being brought indoors in many places in moscow , the emergencies ministry said 31 birds in sunaly village in the chelyabinsk region had died , and in another six cases the diagnosis had been confirmed . a russian agriculture ministry official said friday the risk of the lethal strain occurring in moscow or surrounding area was minimal , despite an outbreak in tula , 300 kilometers -lrb- 190 miles -rrb- south of moscow . russian veterinary services said friday they suspected that the bird flu virus had now spread to 24 areas , including 20 in the novosibirsk region of siberia , three in the kurgan region one in the southern region of stavropol . the tula village of yandovka , where the lethal h5n1 strain of the virus which has killed 61 people in southeast asia since 2003 was found , has been quarantined for three weeks with all poultry there being killed and burned . meanwhile neighbouring ukraine slapped a six-month ban on poultry imports . swans in croatia croatia said further tests were needed to determine if the virus detected in the dead swans was the h5n1 strain , feared to be the precursor of a human pandemic , or more widespread form of epidemic , that could kill millions . the six swans were found in the lake at zdenci in eastern croatia , one of 20 sites croatian veterinary services have put under increased surveillance as part of a huge operation to take samples from wild birds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry is under strict surveillance the french agency for food safety , afssa , recommended increased scrutiny of wildlife , but stopped short of proposing poultry be confined . the united nations ' bird flu envoy flew into china friday where more than 91,000 birds have been destroyed to stamp out a new outbreak .

but hammond is willing to experiment and calls his vineyard the " garage winery . " " people expect something different from me , " he said .
" i have to present something different , something that people think is interesting and that they want to taste and hopefully buy . " germany is the world 's 9th biggest wine grower , and about a quarter of its wines are sold abroad .
britons bought 97 million liters last year and even the french bought 11.2 million liters . even so , new players have been joining the world wine market , which is forcing germans producers to place quality over quantity in order to compete .
but even very high quality is n't always enough .
vineyards often have to come up with unique selling points to establish themselves on the world market , say experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quality beats quantity these days " germany imports more wine than anywhere else , " said ingo swoboda , a wine critic and author .
" that 's why it 's important for growers to have their own image - a german image for german wine .
they also need new ideas to keep up with competitors from overseas . " innovation a hit the rheingau region is at the heart of the german wine industry , which has flourished here for a thousand years .
but increasingly , new names and new products are making their way onto the market .
those include a sort-of riesling-prosecco described by its makers as " frivolous . "
some 20 young growers are involved in its production . " back when we started , the older generation of growers snickered at us and doubted we 'd be successful , " said vintner frank nikolai .
" they could n't believe we wanted to launch the idea together . " their creation has been a hit .
each of the growers contributes part of their riesling harvest to the joint effort .
production is subject to strict quality controls and judges make sure that only wines that meet the standards are used to make the prosecco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : innovation popular in the traditional art embracing new trends does n't mean having to forego tradition .
hans-josef becker uses many of the same techniques as his grandfather .
at the same time , he 's not afraid to tinker .
he was the first german grower to use glass stoppers instead of corks . " it 's really easy to remove the glass stopper , " becker said .
" and you can close it again so that you can put the bottle in the refrigerator . " becker decided to switch to glass stoppers because of the declining quality of natural corks : the more delicate a wine is , like the dry rieslings in his region , the more sensitive it is to unpleasant aftertastes or changes that can come about because of the cork .
the glass stoppers have helped avoid spoiled bottles and won over customers . back to basics there are a total of 13 wine-growing regions in germany : the largest ones , are along the rhine and neckar valleys in the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
but the region around the mosel , saar and ruwer valleys is also famous for its own light , dry white wine - the riesling . a century ago , this was the most expensive wine in the world .
but its reputation , particularly since 1985 , has been declining along with its export numbers .
now , that is beginning to change with a new generation of innovative vintners who want to return the reputation of old . roman niewodniczanski of van volxem vinyard is one of those growers .
he bought an old jesuit monastery in wiltingen on the saar river and completely renovated it - keeping only the wooden wine barrels .
just like in the past , the must - juice from the grapes - ferments in the barrels without any added ingredients . he also believes in going for quality over quantity .
in the past , the vineyards in the region tried to produce as much as possible and as a result , quality - and business - suffered . as a result , he gives his grapes as much sunshine and space as possible .
he is having his stock thinned out and the remaining grapes on the vine wo n't be harvested until november when they 've had the opportunity to soak up as much sun as possible . " if you try these grapes you 'll notice very strong exotic fruit flavors : apricot , passion fruit , papaya - lovely fruit combinations - and they produce fantastic wines , " he said . " we want to produce complex , hand-made wines that will last unlike modern high-tech wines that do n't keep very long . " neighboring winegrowers agree .
" these steep hillsides here make for high cultivation and harvesting costs , " said peter mertes , a winegrower from wiltingen .
" everything has to be done manually .
to compete on the international market , we need something unique - and we can only achieve that via small harvests and high quality .

once seen as a key element in the reinvigoration of the national team , the fast-moving train has derailed .
his chances of playing for germany are sinking rapidly . huth was brought to england from berlin in 2001 .

the one-time cold war symbol became obsolete in 1989 , and huth 's services appear to be heading for the same fate at chelsea .
at the tender age of 21 , he is n't outdated yet , but is getting more and more acquainted with the feeling of the bench 's cold pine on his backside . appearances by huth -lrb- two late substitutions – eight minutes total -rrb- for the blues are almost as rare as losses for the english club , currently undefeated in the premiership . now huth is beginning to sing the blues .
he is determined to break through into the starting line-up of what is rapidly becoming one of europe 's most dominant teams . to stay or not to stay ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti -lrb- front -rrb- and huth at the confed cup " i 'm not going to let myself be pressured .
at the moment , i am not thinking about switching clubs , " he said during preparations for the most recent german friendlies against turkey and china .
he also mentioned that after a recent meeting with chelsea coach jose mourinho , he felt he still had a chance to make it into the starting line-up . german national coach jürgen klinsmann seems less than optimistic about huth ’ s chances of getting a break in the chelsea squad . " if people like ricardo carvalho -lrb- from portugal -rrb- and john terry -lrb- from england -rrb- are in front of robert huth , then you have to be a realist and say that he won ’ t get past two world-class defenders , " klinsmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches joachim löw and jürgen klinsmann -lrb- l. to r . -rrb-
the demand from klinsmann for all of the players who want to play next summer at the world cup in germany is clear : if you don ’ t play for your clubs , he 's let it be known , you wo n't be playing for him . another team might come into question last summer , huth played in his first big tournament for germany , the confederations cup .
the weak play on his part was strongly criticized by the soccer commentators .
the defensive unit as a whole performed poorly .
germany 's goalkeepers fetched the ball from the net 11 times in five games , an amazing fact considering that german teams are renowned if not for the prowess of their strikers , at least for having a rock-solid back line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life under chelsea coach mourinho has been less than optimal for huth to reduce the pressure on the young defender , he was asked to practice with the u-21 national club .
there is still time to play convincingly enough that he will remain part of the national squad , together with the other youthful members like podolski , schweinsteiger and mertesacker . but he has to play .
manfred schulte , huth 's agent , was cited on the sky sports homepage that huth would decide before christmas if he wants to transfer to another club .
schulte said that aston villa from birmingham would be a good fit for both club and player .
the british press confirmed that a transfer at the winter break was set . but bundesliga side schalke has also shown interest in the chelsea substitute .
could there be a switch from the blues of london to the royal blues in gelsenkirchen in the works ? schalke 's sport manager andreas müller told sport-bild magazine that huth is the kind of player that schalke needs at the moment .

once seen as a key element in the reinvigoration of the national team , the fast-moving train has derailed .
his chances of playing for germany are sinking rapidly . huth was brought to england from berlin in 2001 .
at stamford bridge , the grounds of english premiership club chelsea , the fans call him the berlin wall , since he is something of a barricade that strikers must get around .
at 1.87 meters -lrb- 6 ft .
3 in . -rrb- , he has the strength and size that any middle defender playing currently in top-level soccer needs . yet the berlin wall has been neglected lately in london .
the one-time cold war symbol became obsolete in 1989 , and huth 's services appear to be heading for the same fate at chelsea .
at the tender age of 21 , he is n't outdated yet , but is getting more and more acquainted with the feeling of the bench 's cold pine on his backside . appearances by huth -lrb- two late substitutions – eight minutes total -rrb- for the blues are almost as rare as losses for the english club , currently undefeated in the premiership . now huth is beginning to sing the blues .

it arrived in britain from south america last month and had been held with a consignment of birds from taiwan , britain 's agriculture ministry said . the chief veterinary officer declined to speculate whether it had the lethal h5n1 strain , which has spread to romania and turkey . russian outbreak meanwhile , yet another avian flu outbreak was reported in russia , this time in the southern ural region of chelyabinsk , and among swans at a croatian lake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range chickens are being brought indoors in many places in moscow , the emergencies ministry said 31 birds in sunaly village in the chelyabinsk region had died , and in another six cases the diagnosis had been confirmed . a russian agriculture ministry official said friday the risk of the lethal strain occurring in moscow or surrounding area was minimal , despite an outbreak in tula , 300 kilometers -lrb- 190 miles -rrb- south of moscow . russian veterinary services said friday they suspected that the bird flu virus had now spread to 24 areas , including 20 in the novosibirsk region of siberia , three in the kurgan region one in the southern region of stavropol . the tula village of yandovka , where the lethal h5n1 strain of the virus which has killed 61 people in southeast asia since 2003 was found , has been quarantined for three weeks with all poultry there being killed and burned . meanwhile neighbouring ukraine slapped a six-month ban on poultry imports . swans in croatia croatia said further tests were needed to determine if the virus detected in the dead swans was the h5n1 strain , feared to be the precursor of a human pandemic , or more widespread form of epidemic , that could kill millions . the six swans were found in the lake at zdenci in eastern croatia , one of 20 sites croatian veterinary services have put under increased surveillance as part of a huge operation to take samples from wild birds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry is under strict surveillance the french agency for food safety , afssa , recommended increased scrutiny of wildlife , but stopped short of proposing poultry be confined . the united nations ' bird flu envoy flew into china friday where more than 91,000 birds have been destroyed to stamp out a new outbreak .

the boy had close contact with the virus -lrb- from being around sick chickens -rrb- and possibly from handling the birds ' excrement , " siriraj hospital director prasit watanapa said . the asian development bank said it would spend $ 58 million -lrb- 49 million euros -rrb- on two projects to help combat avian flu . european measures in romania , officials said a suspected new case of bird flu had been detected in the northeast only hours after assurances that the outbreak of the deadly h5n1 virus had been contained to two southeastern locations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian health workers have gassed infected domestic birds the world health organization -lrb- wto -rrb- warned against " scaremongering " but it also said each additional human case was making it easier to develop human-to-human transmission of the disease . the czech agriculture ministry banned sales of chickens in markets and exhibitions or sale of other birds in public places . the government of the principality of liechtenstein has banned rearing free range poultry for the next few months following a lead by neighbors austria , germany and switzerland . serious threat to africa migratory birds believed to be carriers may next take the virus to africa , the un 's food and agriculture organisation -lrb- fao -rrb- said , warning that the continent would be an " ideal breeding ground " because of close contact between people and animals . scientists have said ethiopia , kenya , tanzania and uganda were particularly threatened as they host millions of migratory fowl flying to warmer climes during the european winter . senegal - with west africa 's largest bird sanctuaries - asked people to take any poultry found dead to the nearest vet for inspection . the canadian government sought to reassure australia , which imported racing pigeons from canada carrying flu antibodies and subsequently banned canadian bird imports . australia has drawn up a bird flu battle plan including the possibility of holding airline passengers in quarantine in aircraft hangars for six days , a report said saturday . passengers arriving in australia would be subjected to thermal screening for fever and those on an aircraft found to be carrying someone suspected of having bird flu could be held at the airport quarantine centres , the sydney morning herald reported . the government plan would be put into operation if bird flu mutated into a human-to-human virus and posed the risk of a pandemic . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to hamper flu , germans lock up fowl as eu veterinarians meet to set a unified strategy to combat the spreading avian flu , germany took a drastic measure of its own : keeping farmed bird indoors in order to prevent infection from migrating ones .

but hammond is willing to experiment and calls his vineyard the " garage winery . " " people expect something different from me , " he said .
" i have to present something different , something that people think is interesting and that they want to taste and hopefully buy . " germany is the world 's 9th biggest wine grower , and about a quarter of its wines are sold abroad .
britons bought 97 million liters last year and even the french bought 11.2 million liters . even so , new players have been joining the world wine market , which is forcing germans producers to place quality over quantity in order to compete .
but even very high quality is n't always enough .
vineyards often have to come up with unique selling points to establish themselves on the world market , say experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quality beats quantity these days " germany imports more wine than anywhere else , " said ingo swoboda , a wine critic and author .
" that 's why it 's important for growers to have their own image - a german image for german wine .
they also need new ideas to keep up with competitors from overseas . " innovation a hit the rheingau region is at the heart of the german wine industry , which has flourished here for a thousand years .
but increasingly , new names and new products are making their way onto the market .
those include a sort-of riesling-prosecco described by its makers as " frivolous . "
some 20 young growers are involved in its production . " back when we started , the older generation of growers snickered at us and doubted we 'd be successful , " said vintner frank nikolai .
" they could n't believe we wanted to launch the idea together . " their creation has been a hit .
each of the growers contributes part of their riesling harvest to the joint effort .
production is subject to strict quality controls and judges make sure that only wines that meet the standards are used to make the prosecco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : innovation popular in the traditional art embracing new trends does n't mean having to forego tradition .
hans-josef becker uses many of the same techniques as his grandfather .
at the same time , he 's not afraid to tinker .
he was the first german grower to use glass stoppers instead of corks . " it 's really easy to remove the glass stopper , " becker said .
" and you can close it again so that you can put the bottle in the refrigerator . " becker decided to switch to glass stoppers because of the declining quality of natural corks : the more delicate a wine is , like the dry rieslings in his region , the more sensitive it is to unpleasant aftertastes or changes that can come about because of the cork .
the glass stoppers have helped avoid spoiled bottles and won over customers . back to basics there are a total of 13 wine-growing regions in germany : the largest ones , are along the rhine and neckar valleys in the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
but the region around the mosel , saar and ruwer valleys is also famous for its own light , dry white wine - the riesling . a century ago , this was the most expensive wine in the world .
but its reputation , particularly since 1985 , has been declining along with its export numbers .
now , that is beginning to change with a new generation of innovative vintners who want to return the reputation of old . roman niewodniczanski of van volxem vinyard is one of those growers .
he bought an old jesuit monastery in wiltingen on the saar river and completely renovated it - keeping only the wooden wine barrels .
just like in the past , the must - juice from the grapes - ferments in the barrels without any added ingredients . he also believes in going for quality over quantity .
in the past , the vineyards in the region tried to produce as much as possible and as a result , quality - and business - suffered . as a result , he gives his grapes as much sunshine and space as possible .
he is having his stock thinned out and the remaining grapes on the vine wo n't be harvested until november when they 've had the opportunity to soak up as much sun as possible . " if you try these grapes you 'll notice very strong exotic fruit flavors : apricot , passion fruit , papaya - lovely fruit combinations - and they produce fantastic wines , " he said . " we want to produce complex , hand-made wines that will last unlike modern high-tech wines that do n't keep very long . " neighboring winegrowers agree .
" these steep hillsides here make for high cultivation and harvesting costs , " said peter mertes , a winegrower from wiltingen .
" everything has to be done manually .
to compete on the international market , we need something unique - and we can only achieve that via small harvests and high quality .

he attracts younger , better educated , urban-based voters . in the first round , tusk won in warsaw , where kaczynski is currently mayor . kaczynski 's campaign has mirrored his conservatism and played on poles ' patriotism , if not nationalism .
with the elderly , less educated , rural dwellers backing him , he has also played on poles ' painful memories of the past and bucked the usual conservative line by promoting more state intervention in the economy and social system . poland 's president does not usually influence social issues , a duty which falls to the government and lawmakers .

" backers solidarity founder lech walesa has thrown his weight behind tusk while the present-day trade union , which , with around 500,000 members is only a shadow of the original movement , backs kaczynski . bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left , and aleksander kwasniewski tusk also has the backing of kwasniewski and a left-wing party , while kaczynski , who has put himself forward throughout the campaign as poland 's guardian against liberalism , has the support of the extreme-right league of polish families , by the populist , virulently anti-liberal leader of the samoobrona -lrb- self-defence -rrb- party , andrzej lepper ; by the ultra-conservative catholic radio maryja , and the peasants ' party . thirty million poles are eligible to vote although in the first round , less than 50 percent turned out to cast their ballots . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish campaign dredges up the past the hotly-contested polish presidential election campaign has taken an unexpected twist with frontrunner donald tusk facing accusations that his grandfather collaborated with the nazis during world war ii .

it 's what most people throw onto a salad , but an increasing number of germans are also pouring this vegetable oil straight into their tanks as a substitute for diesel .

critics say this is because governments miss out on the taxes that they usually rake in from standard fuels . not recommended in france , you can even get fined for using pure vegetable oil .

and the oil can pose other problems too . " you also ca n't claim for damages if anything goes wrong , " said buchmann .
" it 's also problematic in winter , as it starts to clog up at very cold temperatures . " a proven track record but veggie campaigners say that 's no problem , and point out that you just need to add a bit of diesel during the chillier months .
" we 've been running this business for more than two-and-a-half years , " said lauxen .
" our customers have done hundreds of thousands of kilometers on this stuff and have n't had any problems . "
commodity traders say the increasing trend for pure rapeseed oil among truck drivers , taxis and regular motorists is already evident , with production levels in germany suddenly reaching capacity earlier this season . rocketing prices market analyst martin schrah from the german firm zmp in bonn says another sign is that rapeseed oil prices have gone through the roof as a result of the strong demand .
" they 've jumped by about thirty percent in the last six months , " he said .

it 's what most people throw onto a salad , but an increasing number of germans are also pouring this vegetable oil straight into their tanks as a substitute for diesel .
" it 's a bit better than the cold-pressed variety , if you 're using it for your car , " said lothar lauxen , a veggie-oil enthusiast .
" you can also use it for french fries if you want - the quality 's just as good . "
he has his own garage , and also runs a business supplying rapeseed oil .
he even drives around frankfurt in a car with his company 's motto plastered all over the vehicle in fluorescent green that says : " i drive on pure rapeseed oil . " just like making french fries he 's got every reason to be proud of himself .
conventional oil and diesel are getting ever more expensive , and bio-diesel is hard to get .
for the time being , the network of stations selling it is n't large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetable oils can be multi-purpose more motorists are following lauxen 's lead .
they buy rapeseed oil by the bottle from the local supermarket or , cheaper still , from a wholesaler .
then it 's just a matter of tipping it into the tank - just like filling up a vat for making french fries . of course , you have to put your car into the garage for conversion beforehand - at a cost of a couple of thousand euros .
" we converted 13 trucks for one of our customers , " said lauxen .
" he now saves 280,000 euros a year when filling up . "
an environmentally friendly alternative berthold haas is a self-employed electrician .
he 's dropped in to see lauxen and to buy his weekly dose of rapeseed oil . " i save two-thirds of what i used to pay to fill up a tank , " he said . the european union 's been pushing for the development of pure vegetable oils as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fuels for some time .
in some eu countries , they 're still banned .
critics say this is because governments miss out on the taxes that they usually rake in from standard fuels . not recommended in france , you can even get fined for using pure vegetable oil .
but according to distributors , a few thousand motorists do it anyway . the idea 's fast catching on in germany , too - especially among truck companies .
but the country 's main motoring organization , adac , does n't like the idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecological alternatives to diesel help clean up the motorways " it 's legal and there 's no problem using it to run a vehicle , but we do n't recommend it , " said ulrich buchmann from the adac .
damage can occur unless the right adjustments are made to diesel engines .
and the oil can pose other problems too . " you also ca n't claim for damages if anything goes wrong , " said buchmann .
" it 's also problematic in winter , as it starts to clog up at very cold temperatures . " a proven track record but veggie campaigners say that 's no problem , and point out that you just need to add a bit of diesel during the chillier months .
" we 've been running this business for more than two-and-a-half years , " said lauxen .
" our customers have done hundreds of thousands of kilometers on this stuff and have n't had any problems . "
commodity traders say the increasing trend for pure rapeseed oil among truck drivers , taxis and regular motorists is already evident , with production levels in germany suddenly reaching capacity earlier this season . rocketing prices market analyst martin schrah from the german firm zmp in bonn says another sign is that rapeseed oil prices have gone through the roof as a result of the strong demand .
" they 've jumped by about thirty percent in the last six months , " he said .
" many smaller farms have set up their own presses to produce the oil on location , either as a form of energy or for cooking oil . "

once seen as a key element in the reinvigoration of the national team , the fast-moving train has derailed .
his chances of playing for germany are sinking rapidly . huth was brought to england from berlin in 2001 .
at stamford bridge , the grounds of english premiership club chelsea , the fans call him the berlin wall , since he is something of a barricade that strikers must get around .
at 1.87 meters -lrb- 6 ft .
3 in . -rrb- , he has the strength and size that any middle defender playing currently in top-level soccer needs . yet the berlin wall has been neglected lately in london .
the one-time cold war symbol became obsolete in 1989 , and huth 's services appear to be heading for the same fate at chelsea .
at the tender age of 21 , he is n't outdated yet , but is getting more and more acquainted with the feeling of the bench 's cold pine on his backside . appearances by huth -lrb- two late substitutions – eight minutes total -rrb- for the blues are almost as rare as losses for the english club , currently undefeated in the premiership . now huth is beginning to sing the blues .
he is determined to break through into the starting line-up of what is rapidly becoming one of europe 's most dominant teams . to stay or not to stay ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti -lrb- front -rrb- and huth at the confed cup " i 'm not going to let myself be pressured .

he also mentioned that after a recent meeting with chelsea coach jose mourinho , he felt he still had a chance to make it into the starting line-up . german national coach jürgen klinsmann seems less than optimistic about huth ’ s chances of getting a break in the chelsea squad . " if people like ricardo carvalho -lrb- from portugal -rrb- and john terry -lrb- from england -rrb- are in front of robert huth , then you have to be a realist and say that he won ’ t get past two world-class defenders , " klinsmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches joachim löw and jürgen klinsmann -lrb- l. to r . -rrb-
the demand from klinsmann for all of the players who want to play next summer at the world cup in germany is clear : if you don ’ t play for your clubs , he 's let it be known , you wo n't be playing for him . another team might come into question last summer , huth played in his first big tournament for germany , the confederations cup .
the weak play on his part was strongly criticized by the soccer commentators .
the defensive unit as a whole performed poorly .
germany 's goalkeepers fetched the ball from the net 11 times in five games , an amazing fact considering that german teams are renowned if not for the prowess of their strikers , at least for having a rock-solid back line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life under chelsea coach mourinho has been less than optimal for huth to reduce the pressure on the young defender , he was asked to practice with the u-21 national club .
there is still time to play convincingly enough that he will remain part of the national squad , together with the other youthful members like podolski , schweinsteiger and mertesacker . but he has to play .
manfred schulte , huth 's agent , was cited on the sky sports homepage that huth would decide before christmas if he wants to transfer to another club .
schulte said that aston villa from birmingham would be a good fit for both club and player .
the british press confirmed that a transfer at the winter break was set . but bundesliga side schalke has also shown interest in the chelsea substitute .
could there be a switch from the blues of london to the royal blues in gelsenkirchen in the works ? schalke 's sport manager andreas müller told sport-bild magazine that huth is the kind of player that schalke needs at the moment .

it arrived in britain from south america last month and had been held with a consignment of birds from taiwan , britain 's agriculture ministry said . the chief veterinary officer declined to speculate whether it had the lethal h5n1 strain , which has spread to romania and turkey . russian outbreak meanwhile , yet another avian flu outbreak was reported in russia , this time in the southern ural region of chelyabinsk , and among swans at a croatian lake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range chickens are being brought indoors in many places in moscow , the emergencies ministry said 31 birds in sunaly village in the chelyabinsk region had died , and in another six cases the diagnosis had been confirmed . a russian agriculture ministry official said friday the risk of the lethal strain occurring in moscow or surrounding area was minimal , despite an outbreak in tula , 300 kilometers -lrb- 190 miles -rrb- south of moscow . russian veterinary services said friday they suspected that the bird flu virus had now spread to 24 areas , including 20 in the novosibirsk region of siberia , three in the kurgan region one in the southern region of stavropol . the tula village of yandovka , where the lethal h5n1 strain of the virus which has killed 61 people in southeast asia since 2003 was found , has been quarantined for three weeks with all poultry there being killed and burned . meanwhile neighbouring ukraine slapped a six-month ban on poultry imports . swans in croatia croatia said further tests were needed to determine if the virus detected in the dead swans was the h5n1 strain , feared to be the precursor of a human pandemic , or more widespread form of epidemic , that could kill millions . the six swans were found in the lake at zdenci in eastern croatia , one of 20 sites croatian veterinary services have put under increased surveillance as part of a huge operation to take samples from wild birds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry is under strict surveillance the french agency for food safety , afssa , recommended increased scrutiny of wildlife , but stopped short of proposing poultry be confined . the united nations ' bird flu envoy flew into china friday where more than 91,000 birds have been destroyed to stamp out a new outbreak .

the boy had close contact with the virus -lrb- from being around sick chickens -rrb- and possibly from handling the birds ' excrement , " siriraj hospital director prasit watanapa said . the asian development bank said it would spend $ 58 million -lrb- 49 million euros -rrb- on two projects to help combat avian flu . european measures in romania , officials said a suspected new case of bird flu had been detected in the northeast only hours after assurances that the outbreak of the deadly h5n1 virus had been contained to two southeastern locations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian health workers have gassed infected domestic birds the world health organization -lrb- wto -rrb- warned against " scaremongering " but it also said each additional human case was making it easier to develop human-to-human transmission of the disease . the czech agriculture ministry banned sales of chickens in markets and exhibitions or sale of other birds in public places . the government of the principality of liechtenstein has banned rearing free range poultry for the next few months following a lead by neighbors austria , germany and switzerland . serious threat to africa migratory birds believed to be carriers may next take the virus to africa , the un 's food and agriculture organisation -lrb- fao -rrb- said , warning that the continent would be an " ideal breeding ground " because of close contact between people and animals . scientists have said ethiopia , kenya , tanzania and uganda were particularly threatened as they host millions of migratory fowl flying to warmer climes during the european winter . senegal - with west africa 's largest bird sanctuaries - asked people to take any poultry found dead to the nearest vet for inspection . the canadian government sought to reassure australia , which imported racing pigeons from canada carrying flu antibodies and subsequently banned canadian bird imports . australia has drawn up a bird flu battle plan including the possibility of holding airline passengers in quarantine in aircraft hangars for six days , a report said saturday . passengers arriving in australia would be subjected to thermal screening for fever and those on an aircraft found to be carrying someone suspected of having bird flu could be held at the airport quarantine centres , the sydney morning herald reported . the government plan would be put into operation if bird flu mutated into a human-to-human virus and posed the risk of a pandemic . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to hamper flu , germans lock up fowl as eu veterinarians meet to set a unified strategy to combat the spreading avian flu , germany took a drastic measure of its own : keeping farmed bird indoors in order to prevent infection from migrating ones .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 22.10.2005 chelsea 's robert huth singing the blues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert huth needs more experience on the field robert huth must be asking himself what happened .
once seen as a key element in the reinvigoration of the national team , the fast-moving train has derailed .
his chances of playing for germany are sinking rapidly . huth was brought to england from berlin in 2001 .
at stamford bridge , the grounds of english premiership club chelsea , the fans call him the berlin wall , since he is something of a barricade that strikers must get around .
at 1.87 meters -lrb- 6 ft .
3 in . -rrb- , he has the strength and size that any middle defender playing currently in top-level soccer needs . yet the berlin wall has been neglected lately in london .
the one-time cold war symbol became obsolete in 1989 , and huth 's services appear to be heading for the same fate at chelsea .
at the tender age of 21 , he is n't outdated yet , but is getting more and more acquainted with the feeling of the bench 's cold pine on his backside . appearances by huth -lrb- two late substitutions – eight minutes total -rrb- for the blues are almost as rare as losses for the english club , currently undefeated in the premiership . now huth is beginning to sing the blues .
he is determined to break through into the starting line-up of what is rapidly becoming one of europe 's most dominant teams . to stay or not to stay ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti -lrb- front -rrb- and huth at the confed cup " i 'm not going to let myself be pressured .
at the moment , i am not thinking about switching clubs , " he said during preparations for the most recent german friendlies against turkey and china .
he also mentioned that after a recent meeting with chelsea coach jose mourinho , he felt he still had a chance to make it into the starting line-up . german national coach jürgen klinsmann seems less than optimistic about huth ’ s chances of getting a break in the chelsea squad . " if people like ricardo carvalho -lrb- from portugal -rrb- and john terry -lrb- from england -rrb- are in front of robert huth , then you have to be a realist and say that he won ’ t get past two world-class defenders , " klinsmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches joachim löw and jürgen klinsmann -lrb- l. to r . -rrb-
the demand from klinsmann for all of the players who want to play next summer at the world cup in germany is clear : if you don ’ t play for your clubs , he 's let it be known , you wo n't be playing for him . another team might come into question last summer , huth played in his first big tournament for germany , the confederations cup .
the weak play on his part was strongly criticized by the soccer commentators .
the defensive unit as a whole performed poorly .
germany 's goalkeepers fetched the ball from the net 11 times in five games , an amazing fact considering that german teams are renowned if not for the prowess of their strikers , at least for having a rock-solid back line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life under chelsea coach mourinho has been less than optimal for huth to reduce the pressure on the young defender , he was asked to practice with the u-21 national club .
there is still time to play convincingly enough that he will remain part of the national squad , together with the other youthful members like podolski , schweinsteiger and mertesacker . but he has to play .
manfred schulte , huth 's agent , was cited on the sky sports homepage that huth would decide before christmas if he wants to transfer to another club .

once seen as a key element in the reinvigoration of the national team , the fast-moving train has derailed .
his chances of playing for germany are sinking rapidly . huth was brought to england from berlin in 2001 .
at stamford bridge , the grounds of english premiership club chelsea , the fans call him the berlin wall , since he is something of a barricade that strikers must get around .
at 1.87 meters -lrb- 6 ft .
3 in . -rrb- , he has the strength and size that any middle defender playing currently in top-level soccer needs . yet the berlin wall has been neglected lately in london .
the one-time cold war symbol became obsolete in 1989 , and huth 's services appear to be heading for the same fate at chelsea .
at the tender age of 21 , he is n't outdated yet , but is getting more and more acquainted with the feeling of the bench 's cold pine on his backside . appearances by huth -lrb- two late substitutions – eight minutes total -rrb- for the blues are almost as rare as losses for the english club , currently undefeated in the premiership . now huth is beginning to sing the blues .
he is determined to break through into the starting line-up of what is rapidly becoming one of europe 's most dominant teams . to stay or not to stay ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti -lrb- front -rrb- and huth at the confed cup " i 'm not going to let myself be pressured .
at the moment , i am not thinking about switching clubs , " he said during preparations for the most recent german friendlies against turkey and china .
he also mentioned that after a recent meeting with chelsea coach jose mourinho , he felt he still had a chance to make it into the starting line-up . german national coach jürgen klinsmann seems less than optimistic about huth ’ s chances of getting a break in the chelsea squad . " if people like ricardo carvalho -lrb- from portugal -rrb- and john terry -lrb- from england -rrb- are in front of robert huth , then you have to be a realist and say that he won ’ t get past two world-class defenders , " klinsmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches joachim löw and jürgen klinsmann -lrb- l. to r . -rrb-
the demand from klinsmann for all of the players who want to play next summer at the world cup in germany is clear : if you don ’ t play for your clubs , he 's let it be known , you wo n't be playing for him . another team might come into question last summer , huth played in his first big tournament for germany , the confederations cup .
the weak play on his part was strongly criticized by the soccer commentators .
the defensive unit as a whole performed poorly .
germany 's goalkeepers fetched the ball from the net 11 times in five games , an amazing fact considering that german teams are renowned if not for the prowess of their strikers , at least for having a rock-solid back line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life under chelsea coach mourinho has been less than optimal for huth to reduce the pressure on the young defender , he was asked to practice with the u-21 national club .
there is still time to play convincingly enough that he will remain part of the national squad , together with the other youthful members like podolski , schweinsteiger and mertesacker . but he has to play .
manfred schulte , huth 's agent , was cited on the sky sports homepage that huth would decide before christmas if he wants to transfer to another club .
schulte said that aston villa from birmingham would be a good fit for both club and player .
the british press confirmed that a transfer at the winter break was set . but bundesliga side schalke has also shown interest in the chelsea substitute .
could there be a switch from the blues of london to the royal blues in gelsenkirchen in the works ? schalke 's sport manager andreas müller told sport-bild magazine that huth is the kind of player that schalke needs at the moment .

" becker decided to switch to glass stoppers because of the declining quality of natural corks : the more delicate a wine is , like the dry rieslings in his region , the more sensitive it is to unpleasant aftertastes or changes that can come about because of the cork .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.10.2005 of fast cars and french fries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roaring ahead with rapeseed oil with the cost of crude oil continuing to climb , an increasing number of consumers and companies are running their vehicles on cooking oil - but the country 's motoring body says this could be dangerous . who cares about the price of petrol , when you can take matters into your own hands and simply use rapeseed oil ?
it 's what most people throw onto a salad , but an increasing number of germans are also pouring this vegetable oil straight into their tanks as a substitute for diesel .
" it 's a bit better than the cold-pressed variety , if you 're using it for your car , " said lothar lauxen , a veggie-oil enthusiast .
" you can also use it for french fries if you want - the quality 's just as good . "
he has his own garage , and also runs a business supplying rapeseed oil .
he even drives around frankfurt in a car with his company 's motto plastered all over the vehicle in fluorescent green that says : " i drive on pure rapeseed oil . " just like making french fries he 's got every reason to be proud of himself .
conventional oil and diesel are getting ever more expensive , and bio-diesel is hard to get .
for the time being , the network of stations selling it is n't large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetable oils can be multi-purpose more motorists are following lauxen 's lead .
they buy rapeseed oil by the bottle from the local supermarket or , cheaper still , from a wholesaler .
then it 's just a matter of tipping it into the tank - just like filling up a vat for making french fries . of course , you have to put your car into the garage for conversion beforehand - at a cost of a couple of thousand euros .
" we converted 13 trucks for one of our customers , " said lauxen .
" he now saves 280,000 euros a year when filling up . "
an environmentally friendly alternative berthold haas is a self-employed electrician .
he 's dropped in to see lauxen and to buy his weekly dose of rapeseed oil . " i save two-thirds of what i used to pay to fill up a tank , " he said . the european union 's been pushing for the development of pure vegetable oils as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fuels for some time .
in some eu countries , they 're still banned .
critics say this is because governments miss out on the taxes that they usually rake in from standard fuels . not recommended in france , you can even get fined for using pure vegetable oil .
but according to distributors , a few thousand motorists do it anyway . the idea 's fast catching on in germany , too - especially among truck companies .
but the country 's main motoring organization , adac , does n't like the idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecological alternatives to diesel help clean up the motorways " it 's legal and there 's no problem using it to run a vehicle , but we do n't recommend it , " said ulrich buchmann from the adac .
damage can occur unless the right adjustments are made to diesel engines .
and the oil can pose other problems too . " you also ca n't claim for damages if anything goes wrong , " said buchmann .
" it 's also problematic in winter , as it starts to clog up at very cold temperatures . " a proven track record but veggie campaigners say that 's no problem , and point out that you just need to add a bit of diesel during the chillier months .

it 's what most people throw onto a salad , but an increasing number of germans are also pouring this vegetable oil straight into their tanks as a substitute for diesel .
" it 's a bit better than the cold-pressed variety , if you 're using it for your car , " said lothar lauxen , a veggie-oil enthusiast .
" you can also use it for french fries if you want - the quality 's just as good . "
he has his own garage , and also runs a business supplying rapeseed oil .
he even drives around frankfurt in a car with his company 's motto plastered all over the vehicle in fluorescent green that says : " i drive on pure rapeseed oil . " just like making french fries he 's got every reason to be proud of himself .
conventional oil and diesel are getting ever more expensive , and bio-diesel is hard to get .
for the time being , the network of stations selling it is n't large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetable oils can be multi-purpose more motorists are following lauxen 's lead .
they buy rapeseed oil by the bottle from the local supermarket or , cheaper still , from a wholesaler .
then it 's just a matter of tipping it into the tank - just like filling up a vat for making french fries . of course , you have to put your car into the garage for conversion beforehand - at a cost of a couple of thousand euros .
" we converted 13 trucks for one of our customers , " said lauxen .
" he now saves 280,000 euros a year when filling up . "
an environmentally friendly alternative berthold haas is a self-employed electrician .
he 's dropped in to see lauxen and to buy his weekly dose of rapeseed oil . " i save two-thirds of what i used to pay to fill up a tank , " he said . the european union 's been pushing for the development of pure vegetable oils as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fuels for some time .
in some eu countries , they 're still banned .
critics say this is because governments miss out on the taxes that they usually rake in from standard fuels . not recommended in france , you can even get fined for using pure vegetable oil .
but according to distributors , a few thousand motorists do it anyway . the idea 's fast catching on in germany , too - especially among truck companies .
but the country 's main motoring organization , adac , does n't like the idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecological alternatives to diesel help clean up the motorways " it 's legal and there 's no problem using it to run a vehicle , but we do n't recommend it , " said ulrich buchmann from the adac .
damage can occur unless the right adjustments are made to diesel engines .
and the oil can pose other problems too . " you also ca n't claim for damages if anything goes wrong , " said buchmann .
" it 's also problematic in winter , as it starts to clog up at very cold temperatures . " a proven track record but veggie campaigners say that 's no problem , and point out that you just need to add a bit of diesel during the chillier months .
" we 've been running this business for more than two-and-a-half years , " said lauxen .
" our customers have done hundreds of thousands of kilometers on this stuff and have n't had any problems . "
commodity traders say the increasing trend for pure rapeseed oil among truck drivers , taxis and regular motorists is already evident , with production levels in germany suddenly reaching capacity earlier this season . rocketing prices market analyst martin schrah from the german firm zmp in bonn says another sign is that rapeseed oil prices have gone through the roof as a result of the strong demand .
" they 've jumped by about thirty percent in the last six months , " he said .
" many smaller farms have set up their own presses to produce the oil on location , either as a form of energy or for cooking oil . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to diesel have never been more popular he says the mills are working flat out , and still ca n't keep up with demand .
processors are now increasingly forced to look abroad to satisfy the growing hunger for vegetable oils in germany - whether it 's for cooking or taking the merc out for a spin . ben fajzullin -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fill it up with natural since fuel prices have hit the stratosphere , the search is on for alternatives to gasoline and diesel .

he attracts younger , better educated , urban-based voters . in the first round , tusk won in warsaw , where kaczynski is currently mayor . kaczynski 's campaign has mirrored his conservatism and played on poles ' patriotism , if not nationalism .
with the elderly , less educated , rural dwellers backing him , he has also played on poles ' painful memories of the past and bucked the usual conservative line by promoting more state intervention in the economy and social system . poland 's president does not usually influence social issues , a duty which falls to the government and lawmakers .
but the president has the final say in foreign policy decisions and is commander-in-chief of the army . summing up his program on friday , the last day campaigning was allowed before voting begins at 6:00 a.m.
-lrb- 0400 utc -rrb- on sunday , tusk said his foreign policy would turn poland into a strong and safe country by building friendly relations with neighbours russia and germany through dialogue and maintaining strong ties with nato and washington . he also pledged to work with poland 's eu partners to build a common anti-terrorist policy . a strong poland while kaczynski also favors close ties with washington , nato and the eu , his foreign policy would be based on presenting a strong poland that is not afraid of speaking its mind and banging its fist on the table if need be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski as head of state , he would not put up with the " flippant " attitude moscow showed towards poland when outgoing president aleksander kwasniewski visited the russian capital in may for ceremonies to mark the end of world war ii , and would not allow germany to act against poland 's interests , kaczynski said . poland was irate when german and russian companies signed a deal in september to build a gas pipeline beneath the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states and depriving them of potentially lucrative transit fees . warsaw should also fiercely defend its interests within the eu , kaczynski said . after the first round vote , the conservative presidential contender said a visit to washington would be one of the first on his agenda as president - after the vatican which would take priority " because most poles are catholic . " backers solidarity founder lech walesa has thrown his weight behind tusk while the present-day trade union , which , with around 500,000 members is only a shadow of the original movement , backs kaczynski . bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left , and aleksander kwasniewski tusk also has the backing of kwasniewski and a left-wing party , while kaczynski , who has put himself forward throughout the campaign as poland 's guardian against liberalism , has the support of the extreme-right league of polish families , by the populist , virulently anti-liberal leader of the samoobrona -lrb- self-defence -rrb- party , andrzej lepper ; by the ultra-conservative catholic radio maryja , and the peasants ' party . thirty million poles are eligible to vote although in the first round , less than 50 percent turned out to cast their ballots . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish campaign dredges up the past the hotly-contested polish presidential election campaign has taken an unexpected twist with frontrunner donald tusk facing accusations that his grandfather collaborated with the nazis during world war ii .

he attracts younger , better educated , urban-based voters . in the first round , tusk won in warsaw , where kaczynski is currently mayor . kaczynski 's campaign has mirrored his conservatism and played on poles ' patriotism , if not nationalism .
with the elderly , less educated , rural dwellers backing him , he has also played on poles ' painful memories of the past and bucked the usual conservative line by promoting more state intervention in the economy and social system . poland 's president does not usually influence social issues , a duty which falls to the government and lawmakers .
but the president has the final say in foreign policy decisions and is commander-in-chief of the army . summing up his program on friday , the last day campaigning was allowed before voting begins at 6:00 a.m.
-lrb- 0400 utc -rrb- on sunday , tusk said his foreign policy would turn poland into a strong and safe country by building friendly relations with neighbours russia and germany through dialogue and maintaining strong ties with nato and washington . he also pledged to work with poland 's eu partners to build a common anti-terrorist policy . a strong poland while kaczynski also favors close ties with washington , nato and the eu , his foreign policy would be based on presenting a strong poland that is not afraid of speaking its mind and banging its fist on the table if need be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski as head of state , he would not put up with the " flippant " attitude moscow showed towards poland when outgoing president aleksander kwasniewski visited the russian capital in may for ceremonies to mark the end of world war ii , and would not allow germany to act against poland 's interests , kaczynski said . poland was irate when german and russian companies signed a deal in september to build a gas pipeline beneath the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states and depriving them of potentially lucrative transit fees . warsaw should also fiercely defend its interests within the eu , kaczynski said . after the first round vote , the conservative presidential contender said a visit to washington would be one of the first on his agenda as president - after the vatican which would take priority " because most poles are catholic . " backers solidarity founder lech walesa has thrown his weight behind tusk while the present-day trade union , which , with around 500,000 members is only a shadow of the original movement , backs kaczynski . bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left , and aleksander kwasniewski tusk also has the backing of kwasniewski and a left-wing party , while kaczynski , who has put himself forward throughout the campaign as poland 's guardian against liberalism , has the support of the extreme-right league of polish families , by the populist , virulently anti-liberal leader of the samoobrona -lrb- self-defence -rrb- party , andrzej lepper ; by the ultra-conservative catholic radio maryja , and the peasants ' party . thirty million poles are eligible to vote although in the first round , less than 50 percent turned out to cast their ballots . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish campaign dredges up the past the hotly-contested polish presidential election campaign has taken an unexpected twist with frontrunner donald tusk facing accusations that his grandfather collaborated with the nazis during world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 22.10.2005 chelsea 's robert huth singing the blues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert huth needs more experience on the field robert huth must be asking himself what happened .
once seen as a key element in the reinvigoration of the national team , the fast-moving train has derailed .
his chances of playing for germany are sinking rapidly . huth was brought to england from berlin in 2001 .
at stamford bridge , the grounds of english premiership club chelsea , the fans call him the berlin wall , since he is something of a barricade that strikers must get around .
at 1.87 meters -lrb- 6 ft .
3 in . -rrb- , he has the strength and size that any middle defender playing currently in top-level soccer needs . yet the berlin wall has been neglected lately in london .
the one-time cold war symbol became obsolete in 1989 , and huth 's services appear to be heading for the same fate at chelsea .
at the tender age of 21 , he is n't outdated yet , but is getting more and more acquainted with the feeling of the bench 's cold pine on his backside . appearances by huth -lrb- two late substitutions – eight minutes total -rrb- for the blues are almost as rare as losses for the english club , currently undefeated in the premiership . now huth is beginning to sing the blues .
he is determined to break through into the starting line-up of what is rapidly becoming one of europe 's most dominant teams . to stay or not to stay ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti -lrb- front -rrb- and huth at the confed cup " i 'm not going to let myself be pressured .
at the moment , i am not thinking about switching clubs , " he said during preparations for the most recent german friendlies against turkey and china .
he also mentioned that after a recent meeting with chelsea coach jose mourinho , he felt he still had a chance to make it into the starting line-up . german national coach jürgen klinsmann seems less than optimistic about huth ’ s chances of getting a break in the chelsea squad . " if people like ricardo carvalho -lrb- from portugal -rrb- and john terry -lrb- from england -rrb- are in front of robert huth , then you have to be a realist and say that he won ’ t get past two world-class defenders , " klinsmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches joachim löw and jürgen klinsmann -lrb- l. to r . -rrb-
the demand from klinsmann for all of the players who want to play next summer at the world cup in germany is clear : if you don ’ t play for your clubs , he 's let it be known , you wo n't be playing for him . another team might come into question last summer , huth played in his first big tournament for germany , the confederations cup .
the weak play on his part was strongly criticized by the soccer commentators .
the defensive unit as a whole performed poorly .
germany 's goalkeepers fetched the ball from the net 11 times in five games , an amazing fact considering that german teams are renowned if not for the prowess of their strikers , at least for having a rock-solid back line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life under chelsea coach mourinho has been less than optimal for huth to reduce the pressure on the young defender , he was asked to practice with the u-21 national club .
there is still time to play convincingly enough that he will remain part of the national squad , together with the other youthful members like podolski , schweinsteiger and mertesacker . but he has to play .
manfred schulte , huth 's agent , was cited on the sky sports homepage that huth would decide before christmas if he wants to transfer to another club .
schulte said that aston villa from birmingham would be a good fit for both club and player .
the british press confirmed that a transfer at the winter break was set . but bundesliga side schalke has also shown interest in the chelsea substitute .
could there be a switch from the blues of london to the royal blues in gelsenkirchen in the works ? schalke 's sport manager andreas müller told sport-bild magazine that huth is the kind of player that schalke needs at the moment .
to make things even more interesting , schulte said that he knew nothing about aston villa . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de podolski 's problem in the bundesliga bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .

once seen as a key element in the reinvigoration of the national team , the fast-moving train has derailed .
his chances of playing for germany are sinking rapidly . huth was brought to england from berlin in 2001 .
at stamford bridge , the grounds of english premiership club chelsea , the fans call him the berlin wall , since he is something of a barricade that strikers must get around .
at 1.87 meters -lrb- 6 ft .
3 in . -rrb- , he has the strength and size that any middle defender playing currently in top-level soccer needs . yet the berlin wall has been neglected lately in london .
the one-time cold war symbol became obsolete in 1989 , and huth 's services appear to be heading for the same fate at chelsea .
at the tender age of 21 , he is n't outdated yet , but is getting more and more acquainted with the feeling of the bench 's cold pine on his backside . appearances by huth -lrb- two late substitutions – eight minutes total -rrb- for the blues are almost as rare as losses for the english club , currently undefeated in the premiership . now huth is beginning to sing the blues .
he is determined to break through into the starting line-up of what is rapidly becoming one of europe 's most dominant teams . to stay or not to stay ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti -lrb- front -rrb- and huth at the confed cup " i 'm not going to let myself be pressured .

he also mentioned that after a recent meeting with chelsea coach jose mourinho , he felt he still had a chance to make it into the starting line-up . german national coach jürgen klinsmann seems less than optimistic about huth ’ s chances of getting a break in the chelsea squad . " if people like ricardo carvalho -lrb- from portugal -rrb- and john terry -lrb- from england -rrb- are in front of robert huth , then you have to be a realist and say that he won ’ t get past two world-class defenders , " klinsmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches joachim löw and jürgen klinsmann -lrb- l. to r . -rrb-

the weak play on his part was strongly criticized by the soccer commentators .
the defensive unit as a whole performed poorly .
germany 's goalkeepers fetched the ball from the net 11 times in five games , an amazing fact considering that german teams are renowned if not for the prowess of their strikers , at least for having a rock-solid back line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life under chelsea coach mourinho has been less than optimal for huth to reduce the pressure on the young defender , he was asked to practice with the u-21 national club .
there is still time to play convincingly enough that he will remain part of the national squad , together with the other youthful members like podolski , schweinsteiger and mertesacker . but he has to play .
manfred schulte , huth 's agent , was cited on the sky sports homepage that huth would decide before christmas if he wants to transfer to another club .
schulte said that aston villa from birmingham would be a good fit for both club and player .
the british press confirmed that a transfer at the winter break was set . but bundesliga side schalke has also shown interest in the chelsea substitute .
could there be a switch from the blues of london to the royal blues in gelsenkirchen in the works ? schalke 's sport manager andreas müller told sport-bild magazine that huth is the kind of player that schalke needs at the moment .

but hammond is willing to experiment and calls his vineyard the " garage winery . " " people expect something different from me , " he said .
" i have to present something different , something that people think is interesting and that they want to taste and hopefully buy . " germany is the world 's 9th biggest wine grower , and about a quarter of its wines are sold abroad .
britons bought 97 million liters last year and even the french bought 11.2 million liters . even so , new players have been joining the world wine market , which is forcing germans producers to place quality over quantity in order to compete .
but even very high quality is n't always enough .
vineyards often have to come up with unique selling points to establish themselves on the world market , say experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quality beats quantity these days " germany imports more wine than anywhere else , " said ingo swoboda , a wine critic and author .
" that 's why it 's important for growers to have their own image - a german image for german wine .
they also need new ideas to keep up with competitors from overseas . " innovation a hit the rheingau region is at the heart of the german wine industry , which has flourished here for a thousand years .
but increasingly , new names and new products are making their way onto the market .
those include a sort-of riesling-prosecco described by its makers as " frivolous . "
some 20 young growers are involved in its production . " back when we started , the older generation of growers snickered at us and doubted we 'd be successful , " said vintner frank nikolai .
" they could n't believe we wanted to launch the idea together . " their creation has been a hit .
each of the growers contributes part of their riesling harvest to the joint effort .
production is subject to strict quality controls and judges make sure that only wines that meet the standards are used to make the prosecco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : innovation popular in the traditional art embracing new trends does n't mean having to forego tradition .
hans-josef becker uses many of the same techniques as his grandfather .
at the same time , he 's not afraid to tinker .
he was the first german grower to use glass stoppers instead of corks . " it 's really easy to remove the glass stopper , " becker said .
" and you can close it again so that you can put the bottle in the refrigerator . " becker decided to switch to glass stoppers because of the declining quality of natural corks : the more delicate a wine is , like the dry rieslings in his region , the more sensitive it is to unpleasant aftertastes or changes that can come about because of the cork .
the glass stoppers have helped avoid spoiled bottles and won over customers . back to basics there are a total of 13 wine-growing regions in germany : the largest ones , are along the rhine and neckar valleys in the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
but the region around the mosel , saar and ruwer valleys is also famous for its own light , dry white wine - the riesling . a century ago , this was the most expensive wine in the world .
but its reputation , particularly since 1985 , has been declining along with its export numbers .
now , that is beginning to change with a new generation of innovative vintners who want to return the reputation of old . roman niewodniczanski of van volxem vinyard is one of those growers .
he bought an old jesuit monastery in wiltingen on the saar river and completely renovated it - keeping only the wooden wine barrels .
just like in the past , the must - juice from the grapes - ferments in the barrels without any added ingredients . he also believes in going for quality over quantity .
in the past , the vineyards in the region tried to produce as much as possible and as a result , quality - and business - suffered . as a result , he gives his grapes as much sunshine and space as possible .
he is having his stock thinned out and the remaining grapes on the vine wo n't be harvested until november when they 've had the opportunity to soak up as much sun as possible . " if you try these grapes you 'll notice very strong exotic fruit flavors : apricot , passion fruit , papaya - lovely fruit combinations - and they produce fantastic wines , " he said . " we want to produce complex , hand-made wines that will last unlike modern high-tech wines that do n't keep very long . " neighboring winegrowers agree .
" these steep hillsides here make for high cultivation and harvesting costs , " said peter mertes , a winegrower from wiltingen .
" everything has to be done manually .
to compete on the international market , we need something unique - and we can only achieve that via small harvests and high quality .

it 's what most people throw onto a salad , but an increasing number of germans are also pouring this vegetable oil straight into their tanks as a substitute for diesel .
" it 's a bit better than the cold-pressed variety , if you 're using it for your car , " said lothar lauxen , a veggie-oil enthusiast .
" you can also use it for french fries if you want - the quality 's just as good . "
he has his own garage , and also runs a business supplying rapeseed oil .
he even drives around frankfurt in a car with his company 's motto plastered all over the vehicle in fluorescent green that says : " i drive on pure rapeseed oil . " just like making french fries he 's got every reason to be proud of himself .
conventional oil and diesel are getting ever more expensive , and bio-diesel is hard to get .
for the time being , the network of stations selling it is n't large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetable oils can be multi-purpose more motorists are following lauxen 's lead .
they buy rapeseed oil by the bottle from the local supermarket or , cheaper still , from a wholesaler .
then it 's just a matter of tipping it into the tank - just like filling up a vat for making french fries . of course , you have to put your car into the garage for conversion beforehand - at a cost of a couple of thousand euros .
" we converted 13 trucks for one of our customers , " said lauxen .
" he now saves 280,000 euros a year when filling up . "
an environmentally friendly alternative berthold haas is a self-employed electrician .
he 's dropped in to see lauxen and to buy his weekly dose of rapeseed oil . " i save two-thirds of what i used to pay to fill up a tank , " he said . the european union 's been pushing for the development of pure vegetable oils as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fuels for some time .
in some eu countries , they 're still banned .
critics say this is because governments miss out on the taxes that they usually rake in from standard fuels . not recommended in france , you can even get fined for using pure vegetable oil .
but according to distributors , a few thousand motorists do it anyway . the idea 's fast catching on in germany , too - especially among truck companies .
but the country 's main motoring organization , adac , does n't like the idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecological alternatives to diesel help clean up the motorways " it 's legal and there 's no problem using it to run a vehicle , but we do n't recommend it , " said ulrich buchmann from the adac .
damage can occur unless the right adjustments are made to diesel engines .
and the oil can pose other problems too . " you also ca n't claim for damages if anything goes wrong , " said buchmann .
" it 's also problematic in winter , as it starts to clog up at very cold temperatures . " a proven track record but veggie campaigners say that 's no problem , and point out that you just need to add a bit of diesel during the chillier months .
" we 've been running this business for more than two-and-a-half years , " said lauxen .
" our customers have done hundreds of thousands of kilometers on this stuff and have n't had any problems . "
commodity traders say the increasing trend for pure rapeseed oil among truck drivers , taxis and regular motorists is already evident , with production levels in germany suddenly reaching capacity earlier this season . rocketing prices market analyst martin schrah from the german firm zmp in bonn says another sign is that rapeseed oil prices have gone through the roof as a result of the strong demand .
" they 've jumped by about thirty percent in the last six months , " he said .
" many smaller farms have set up their own presses to produce the oil on location , either as a form of energy or for cooking oil . "

it 's what most people throw onto a salad , but an increasing number of germans are also pouring this vegetable oil straight into their tanks as a substitute for diesel .
" it 's a bit better than the cold-pressed variety , if you 're using it for your car , " said lothar lauxen , a veggie-oil enthusiast .
" you can also use it for french fries if you want - the quality 's just as good . "
he has his own garage , and also runs a business supplying rapeseed oil .
he even drives around frankfurt in a car with his company 's motto plastered all over the vehicle in fluorescent green that says : " i drive on pure rapeseed oil . " just like making french fries he 's got every reason to be proud of himself .
conventional oil and diesel are getting ever more expensive , and bio-diesel is hard to get .
for the time being , the network of stations selling it is n't large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetable oils can be multi-purpose more motorists are following lauxen 's lead .
they buy rapeseed oil by the bottle from the local supermarket or , cheaper still , from a wholesaler .
then it 's just a matter of tipping it into the tank - just like filling up a vat for making french fries . of course , you have to put your car into the garage for conversion beforehand - at a cost of a couple of thousand euros .
" we converted 13 trucks for one of our customers , " said lauxen .
" he now saves 280,000 euros a year when filling up . "
an environmentally friendly alternative berthold haas is a self-employed electrician .
he 's dropped in to see lauxen and to buy his weekly dose of rapeseed oil . " i save two-thirds of what i used to pay to fill up a tank , " he said . the european union 's been pushing for the development of pure vegetable oils as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fuels for some time .
in some eu countries , they 're still banned .
critics say this is because governments miss out on the taxes that they usually rake in from standard fuels . not recommended in france , you can even get fined for using pure vegetable oil .
but according to distributors , a few thousand motorists do it anyway . the idea 's fast catching on in germany , too - especially among truck companies .
but the country 's main motoring organization , adac , does n't like the idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecological alternatives to diesel help clean up the motorways " it 's legal and there 's no problem using it to run a vehicle , but we do n't recommend it , " said ulrich buchmann from the adac .
damage can occur unless the right adjustments are made to diesel engines .
and the oil can pose other problems too . " you also ca n't claim for damages if anything goes wrong , " said buchmann .
" it 's also problematic in winter , as it starts to clog up at very cold temperatures . " a proven track record but veggie campaigners say that 's no problem , and point out that you just need to add a bit of diesel during the chillier months .
" we 've been running this business for more than two-and-a-half years , " said lauxen .
" our customers have done hundreds of thousands of kilometers on this stuff and have n't had any problems . "
commodity traders say the increasing trend for pure rapeseed oil among truck drivers , taxis and regular motorists is already evident , with production levels in germany suddenly reaching capacity earlier this season . rocketing prices market analyst martin schrah from the german firm zmp in bonn says another sign is that rapeseed oil prices have gone through the roof as a result of the strong demand .
" they 've jumped by about thirty percent in the last six months , " he said .
" many smaller farms have set up their own presses to produce the oil on location , either as a form of energy or for cooking oil . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternatives to diesel have never been more popular he says the mills are working flat out , and still ca n't keep up with demand .
processors are now increasingly forced to look abroad to satisfy the growing hunger for vegetable oils in germany - whether it 's for cooking or taking the merc out for a spin . ben fajzullin -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fill it up with natural since fuel prices have hit the stratosphere , the search is on for alternatives to gasoline and diesel .

he attracts younger , better educated , urban-based voters . in the first round , tusk won in warsaw , where kaczynski is currently mayor . kaczynski 's campaign has mirrored his conservatism and played on poles ' patriotism , if not nationalism .
with the elderly , less educated , rural dwellers backing him , he has also played on poles ' painful memories of the past and bucked the usual conservative line by promoting more state intervention in the economy and social system . poland 's president does not usually influence social issues , a duty which falls to the government and lawmakers .
but the president has the final say in foreign policy decisions and is commander-in-chief of the army . summing up his program on friday , the last day campaigning was allowed before voting begins at 6:00 a.m.
-lrb- 0400 utc -rrb- on sunday , tusk said his foreign policy would turn poland into a strong and safe country by building friendly relations with neighbours russia and germany through dialogue and maintaining strong ties with nato and washington . he also pledged to work with poland 's eu partners to build a common anti-terrorist policy . a strong poland while kaczynski also favors close ties with washington , nato and the eu , his foreign policy would be based on presenting a strong poland that is not afraid of speaking its mind and banging its fist on the table if need be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski as head of state , he would not put up with the " flippant " attitude moscow showed towards poland when outgoing president aleksander kwasniewski visited the russian capital in may for ceremonies to mark the end of world war ii , and would not allow germany to act against poland 's interests , kaczynski said . poland was irate when german and russian companies signed a deal in september to build a gas pipeline beneath the baltic sea , bypassing poland and the baltic states and depriving them of potentially lucrative transit fees . warsaw should also fiercely defend its interests within the eu , kaczynski said . after the first round vote , the conservative presidential contender said a visit to washington would be one of the first on his agenda as president - after the vatican which would take priority " because most poles are catholic . " backers solidarity founder lech walesa has thrown his weight behind tusk while the present-day trade union , which , with around 500,000 members is only a shadow of the original movement , backs kaczynski . bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left , and aleksander kwasniewski tusk also has the backing of kwasniewski and a left-wing party , while kaczynski , who has put himself forward throughout the campaign as poland 's guardian against liberalism , has the support of the extreme-right league of polish families , by the populist , virulently anti-liberal leader of the samoobrona -lrb- self-defence -rrb- party , andrzej lepper ; by the ultra-conservative catholic radio maryja , and the peasants ' party . thirty million poles are eligible to vote although in the first round , less than 50 percent turned out to cast their ballots . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish campaign dredges up the past the hotly-contested polish presidential election campaign has taken an unexpected twist with frontrunner donald tusk facing accusations that his grandfather collaborated with the nazis during world war ii .

once seen as a key element in the reinvigoration of the national team , the fast-moving train has derailed .
his chances of playing for germany are sinking rapidly . huth was brought to england from berlin in 2001 .
at stamford bridge , the grounds of english premiership club chelsea , the fans call him the berlin wall , since he is something of a barricade that strikers must get around .
at 1.87 meters -lrb- 6 ft .
3 in . -rrb- , he has the strength and size that any middle defender playing currently in top-level soccer needs . yet the berlin wall has been neglected lately in london .
the one-time cold war symbol became obsolete in 1989 , and huth 's services appear to be heading for the same fate at chelsea .
at the tender age of 21 , he is n't outdated yet , but is getting more and more acquainted with the feeling of the bench 's cold pine on his backside . appearances by huth -lrb- two late substitutions – eight minutes total -rrb- for the blues are almost as rare as losses for the english club , currently undefeated in the premiership . now huth is beginning to sing the blues .
he is determined to break through into the starting line-up of what is rapidly becoming one of europe 's most dominant teams . to stay or not to stay ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti -lrb- front -rrb- and huth at the confed cup " i 'm not going to let myself be pressured .
at the moment , i am not thinking about switching clubs , " he said during preparations for the most recent german friendlies against turkey and china .
he also mentioned that after a recent meeting with chelsea coach jose mourinho , he felt he still had a chance to make it into the starting line-up . german national coach jürgen klinsmann seems less than optimistic about huth ’ s chances of getting a break in the chelsea squad . " if people like ricardo carvalho -lrb- from portugal -rrb- and john terry -lrb- from england -rrb- are in front of robert huth , then you have to be a realist and say that he won ’ t get past two world-class defenders , " klinsmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coaches joachim löw and jürgen klinsmann -lrb- l. to r . -rrb-
the demand from klinsmann for all of the players who want to play next summer at the world cup in germany is clear : if you don ’ t play for your clubs , he 's let it be known , you wo n't be playing for him . another team might come into question last summer , huth played in his first big tournament for germany , the confederations cup .
the weak play on his part was strongly criticized by the soccer commentators .
the defensive unit as a whole performed poorly .
germany 's goalkeepers fetched the ball from the net 11 times in five games , an amazing fact considering that german teams are renowned if not for the prowess of their strikers , at least for having a rock-solid back line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life under chelsea coach mourinho has been less than optimal for huth to reduce the pressure on the young defender , he was asked to practice with the u-21 national club .
there is still time to play convincingly enough that he will remain part of the national squad , together with the other youthful members like podolski , schweinsteiger and mertesacker . but he has to play .
manfred schulte , huth 's agent , was cited on the sky sports homepage that huth would decide before christmas if he wants to transfer to another club .
schulte said that aston villa from birmingham would be a good fit for both club and player .
the british press confirmed that a transfer at the winter break was set . but bundesliga side schalke has also shown interest in the chelsea substitute .
could there be a switch from the blues of london to the royal blues in gelsenkirchen in the works ? schalke 's sport manager andreas müller told sport-bild magazine that huth is the kind of player that schalke needs at the moment .

but hammond is willing to experiment and calls his vineyard the " garage winery . " " people expect something different from me , " he said .
" i have to present something different , something that people think is interesting and that they want to taste and hopefully buy . " germany is the world 's 9th biggest wine grower , and about a quarter of its wines are sold abroad .
britons bought 97 million liters last year and even the french bought 11.2 million liters . even so , new players have been joining the world wine market , which is forcing germans producers to place quality over quantity in order to compete .
but even very high quality is n't always enough .
vineyards often have to come up with unique selling points to establish themselves on the world market , say experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quality beats quantity these days " germany imports more wine than anywhere else , " said ingo swoboda , a wine critic and author .
" that 's why it 's important for growers to have their own image - a german image for german wine .
they also need new ideas to keep up with competitors from overseas . " innovation a hit the rheingau region is at the heart of the german wine industry , which has flourished here for a thousand years .
but increasingly , new names and new products are making their way onto the market .
those include a sort-of riesling-prosecco described by its makers as " frivolous . "
some 20 young growers are involved in its production . " back when we started , the older generation of growers snickered at us and doubted we 'd be successful , " said vintner frank nikolai .
" they could n't believe we wanted to launch the idea together . " their creation has been a hit .
each of the growers contributes part of their riesling harvest to the joint effort .
production is subject to strict quality controls and judges make sure that only wines that meet the standards are used to make the prosecco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : innovation popular in the traditional art embracing new trends does n't mean having to forego tradition .
hans-josef becker uses many of the same techniques as his grandfather .
at the same time , he 's not afraid to tinker .
he was the first german grower to use glass stoppers instead of corks . " it 's really easy to remove the glass stopper , " becker said .
" and you can close it again so that you can put the bottle in the refrigerator . " becker decided to switch to glass stoppers because of the declining quality of natural corks : the more delicate a wine is , like the dry rieslings in his region , the more sensitive it is to unpleasant aftertastes or changes that can come about because of the cork .
the glass stoppers have helped avoid spoiled bottles and won over customers . back to basics there are a total of 13 wine-growing regions in germany : the largest ones , are along the rhine and neckar valleys in the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
but the region around the mosel , saar and ruwer valleys is also famous for its own light , dry white wine - the riesling . a century ago , this was the most expensive wine in the world .
but its reputation , particularly since 1985 , has been declining along with its export numbers .
now , that is beginning to change with a new generation of innovative vintners who want to return the reputation of old . roman niewodniczanski of van volxem vinyard is one of those growers .
he bought an old jesuit monastery in wiltingen on the saar river and completely renovated it - keeping only the wooden wine barrels .
just like in the past , the must - juice from the grapes - ferments in the barrels without any added ingredients . he also believes in going for quality over quantity .
in the past , the vineyards in the region tried to produce as much as possible and as a result , quality - and business - suffered . as a result , he gives his grapes as much sunshine and space as possible .
he is having his stock thinned out and the remaining grapes on the vine wo n't be harvested until november when they 've had the opportunity to soak up as much sun as possible . " if you try these grapes you 'll notice very strong exotic fruit flavors : apricot , passion fruit , papaya - lovely fruit combinations - and they produce fantastic wines , " he said . " we want to produce complex , hand-made wines that will last unlike modern high-tech wines that do n't keep very long . " neighboring winegrowers agree .
" these steep hillsides here make for high cultivation and harvesting costs , " said peter mertes , a winegrower from wiltingen .
" everything has to be done manually .
to compete on the international market , we need something unique - and we can only achieve that via small harvests and high quality .

hans-josef becker uses many of the same techniques as his grandfather .
at the same time , he 's not afraid to tinker .
he was the first german grower to use glass stoppers instead of corks . " it 's really easy to remove the glass stopper , " becker said .
" and you can close it again so that you can put the bottle in the refrigerator . " becker decided to switch to glass stoppers because of the declining quality of natural corks : the more delicate a wine is , like the dry rieslings in his region , the more sensitive it is to unpleasant aftertastes or changes that can come about because of the cork .
the glass stoppers have helped avoid spoiled bottles and won over customers . back to basics there are a total of 13 wine-growing regions in germany : the largest ones , are along the rhine and neckar valleys in the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
but the region around the mosel , saar and ruwer valleys is also famous for its own light , dry white wine - the riesling . a century ago , this was the most expensive wine in the world .
but its reputation , particularly since 1985 , has been declining along with its export numbers .
now , that is beginning to change with a new generation of innovative vintners who want to return the reputation of old . roman niewodniczanski of van volxem vinyard is one of those growers .
he bought an old jesuit monastery in wiltingen on the saar river and completely renovated it - keeping only the wooden wine barrels .
just like in the past , the must - juice from the grapes - ferments in the barrels without any added ingredients . he also believes in going for quality over quantity .
in the past , the vineyards in the region tried to produce as much as possible and as a result , quality - and business - suffered . as a result , he gives his grapes as much sunshine and space as possible .
he is having his stock thinned out and the remaining grapes on the vine wo n't be harvested until november when they 've had the opportunity to soak up as much sun as possible . " if you try these grapes you 'll notice very strong exotic fruit flavors : apricot , passion fruit , papaya - lovely fruit combinations - and they produce fantastic wines , " he said . " we want to produce complex , hand-made wines that will last unlike modern high-tech wines that do n't keep very long . " neighboring winegrowers agree .
" these steep hillsides here make for high cultivation and harvesting costs , " said peter mertes , a winegrower from wiltingen .
" everything has to be done manually .
to compete on the international market , we need something unique - and we can only achieve that via small harvests and high quality .

razza avoided traps , escaped dogs , and ultimately swam a record distance from one uninhabited island to another .
researchers from the university of auckland in new zealand had problems catching him even though they had fitted him with a radio transmitter .
he was finally killed by a trap 18 weeks after the experiment began .
the researchers released razza to study " the problem of rats reinvading islands that have been cleared " , author mick clout told the associated press news agency .
the research was reported in the scientific journal nature .
let loose on the uninhabited new zealand island of motuhoropapa , razza ran free for 10 weeks before swimming 400m -lrb- 1300ft -rrb- to a nearby island which was also deserted .
it is thought to be the longest swim across open water ever recorded for a rat .
just lucky ?
it then took the scientists another eight weeks to find and catch him once he arrived on otata island .
" we were literally tearing our hair out at times trying to find this animal , " mr clout said .
he said it was fortunate they had used a lone male rat in the experiment .
" if this had been a pregnant female rat it would have been a problem .
it takes only one to establish a population . "
scientists have released a new male rat in a follow-up experiment to see if razza was unusually clever or lucky .
" we want to check whether this was normal behaviour , " mr clout said .

razza avoided traps , escaped dogs , and ultimately swam a record distance from one uninhabited island to another .
researchers from the university of auckland in new zealand had problems catching him even though they had fitted him with a radio transmitter .
he was finally killed by a trap 18 weeks after the experiment began .
the researchers released razza to study " the problem of rats reinvading islands that have been cleared " , author mick clout told the associated press news agency .
the research was reported in the scientific journal nature .
let loose on the uninhabited new zealand island of motuhoropapa , razza ran free for 10 weeks before swimming 400m -lrb- 1300ft -rrb- to a nearby island which was also deserted .
