he found willing participants in lionel jospin in france and giuliano amato in italy .
but few were more convinced at the time than newly elected german chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder joins wave of center-left optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democrats came into power in 1998 after 16 years in opposition to helmut kohl 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
schröder , a former chairman of the radical social democratic student association , fought and won the election on his pledges to bring economic stability and development to germany and to increase domestic security and continuity in foreign affairs . a charismatic young leader , schröder was quick to associate himself with tony blair and us president bill clinton as one of the " new breed " of center-left leaders who were driving their countries away from conservative governments which had been led by the likes of kohl , ronald reagan and margaret thatcher .
it did n't take long for schröder to be seduced by the third way . in june 1999 , schröder and blair came together to write and publish the center-left manifesto " europe : the third way / die neue mitte . "
the leaders of great britain and germany were now working together to advocate a change to the traditional policy instruments in areas such as the concept of social justice , the role of the state , the balance between individualism and collectivism , and entrepreneurial spirit .
it was an alternative model to the old labels of right and left and one that fitted the atmosphere of optimism which hung over europe as the new millennium dawned . please continue reading to find out about the third way 's demise 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair calls election on may 5 british prime minister tony blair , eager to lead his labor party to an unprecedented third straight term in power , ended weeks of speculation tuesday and called a general election for may 5 .

born in warsaw , six months before nazi germany invaded poland starting world war ii , the most deadly conflict in history , he was smuggled out of poland by his mother immediately after the start of the war .
his family spent the war in the soviet union , and survived the conflict intact - a rarity for polish jews . " i think this march is the right thing , as far as the future is concerned , to remember what happened .

travel researcher aderhold explained said that in the past , a german retiree 's vacation consisted of sitting in his backyard .
today , " a 65 year old will do things that they would n't have done years ago , " he said .
" a hiking tour in south america or something , they 're doing activities that we used to associate with 30- or 40-year-olds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiking seniors and retirees who take such trips tend to be at an age where they can afford high quality clothing and equipment .
" they want the best textiles , nice bags , good shoes , " globetrotter 's bartmann said .
" and they want sales assistance . "
another booming sector is families , bartmann said .
even if most people do chose relaxation trips , many are opting for " adventurous " activities like canoe trips and camping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : camping family the sector has increased noticeably over the past five years , bartmann noted .
" you come into our store on a friday night and it is just full of families with children .
in the end it may still be a small segment of the market , but previously it did n't exist at all .
so it is very important for our sales . "
trying to make the most out of this development , outdoor companies increasingly aim their marketing campaigns at families .
one example is the cooperation jack wolfskin , germany 's largest outdoor goods manufacturer , started with mercedes benz in 2004 to offer an outdoor-sports competition for families .
and retailers such as globetrotter and the cologne-based blackfoot regularly offer classes and seminars aimed at families .
nostalgic trend also , the renewed interest in the great outdoors may be part of a general nostalgic trend sweeping through germany , according to travel researcher aderhold .
" younger people are n't rejecting the home market anymore , " he said .
" the alps , in germany as well as austria and switzerland , are back in fashion to some extent . "
finally - and possibly most importantly - the retailers note that what once counted as a specialist product now has a much larger use in the marketplace .
businessmen carry backpacks , kids wear gore-tex hiking boots to school , and housewives put on their ultra-light , breathable , all-weather jacket to go to the market .
" it used to be these things were just for the hardcore outdoorsman , " bartmann said .

these days , there is a mind boggling array of outdoor sports and leisure activities on offer to average folks : mountainbiking , canyoning , rock climbing , nordic walking , hiking , windsurfing , kayaking , canoeing , sailing - the list just keeps getting longer .
and the market share of outdoor products -lrb- a subset of the sporting goods industry , -rrb- keeps growing right along with it .
stable sales outdoor products have become responsible for 31 percent of the overall sporting goods market , up from 27 percent in 2001 .
and while most german retail sectors saw decreased sales over the past year , revenues in the outdoor sector remained relatively stable , totaling 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.94 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
" our industry has seen a relatively stable level of sales - somewhere between negative 0.3 percent to zero percent sales growth , " said andreas bartmann , ceo of globetrotter , germany 's largest sporting goods and outdoor-equipment retailer .
" but other industries have had it much worse .
the textile industry was down a full 2 percent last year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walkers in munich in general , germans are an outdoorsy lot .
on ascension day this thursday , a national holiday in germany , millions will head outside .
the sunday afternoon hike is a time-honored family tradition , and sports clubs are a widely used social outlet .
this is reflected in the overall sales of sporting goods , said helmut ott , who heads up the alliance of german sporting goods dealers .
despite overwhelming economic woes , the sector is surviving .
" of all those doing poorly , we 're doing best , " ott said with a laugh .
sales in the " basics " - soccer shoes and shirts for example - are still selling , he said .
" but for the time being , outdoors equipment brings in the most money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchibo branch office in dortmund he noted that the industry is feeling a lot of pressure from massive discount chains like aldi , lidl and tchibo .
these companies sell low-cost food or coffee , but in addition they bring out a limited number of nonfood items each week .
the shopper who stays on top of the changing product lines can buy in-line skates , hiking boots , an all-weather jacket , pocket knife , tent or riding jodhpurs for a fraction of what they would cost in a sporting goods shop .
the pressure has meant that some smaller stores have been squeezed out of the sector altogether .
the secret of survival ?
do n't try to compete with discounters by lowering prices and slashing staff , said globetrotter 's bartmann .
" the stores that succeed have a different concept , " he said .
" they 've made going into the store an emotional experience , one that gives you the feeling of the outdoors . "
bildunterschrift : globetrotter 's climbing window a case in point is globetrotter 's hamburg store , which has an outdoor-adventure ambiance and features a built-in climbing wall -lrb- above -rrb- , a multi-surface walking course for testing hiking boots , and a plant-filled cafe .

the company , which employs 600 people in germany , has seen sales rise 18 percent over the past four years , to around 100 million euros at the end of february .
at the cologne branch of the retail chain outdoor , which opened in 2004 , manager maurice goddar said sales have been booming .
he attributed the success to the fact that the store offers expert customer advice as well as replacement parts .
" at some point people want quality , " goddar said .
" and then they come to us . "
" nordic walking is huge " at his store , " tents are big sellers even though we are in the middle of the city , " he said .
" do n't ask me why .
people in their 20s buy a lot of climbing equipment .
and the whole nordic walking thing has been huge . "
but peter aderhold , chief of the travel and holiday research group , cautioned that it is wrong to assume germans are taking more active vacations just because outdoor retailers ' cash registers are ringing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german vacationer in cuxhaven in fact , " with daily stress levels increasing due to the uncertain job market , and the fact that people are working so much ... the trend in the german travel market is toward lower activity vacations - sitting on the beach eating ice cream rather than doing some exotic trek , " he said .
so what explains the growth of the market sector ?

travel researcher aderhold explained said that in the past , a german retiree 's vacation consisted of sitting in his backyard .

" a hiking tour in south america or something , they 're doing activities that we used to associate with 30- or 40-year-olds . "

" i am naturally very moved to be on the spot where the worst happened , " sharon told journalists accompanying him on his plane . survivors revisit torture chambers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of children in prisoners ' clothes stand behind barbed wire in the auschwitz concentration camp .
at auschwitz , thousands crowded into the camp , touring its gas chambers , torture cells , execution wall , the barracks into which the nazis crammed the first inmates . " i had to come here to see where my people were murdered , " an elderly woman from the southern us state of florida told afp , before breaking off abruptly , her voice wracked by sobs .
" now i see it and it 's horrible , " she said , apologizing for her tears . irene zattfild , of hungarian jewish extraction , was taking part in her fifth march of the living .
she was interned at auschwitz when she was 13 and lost her entire family here .
" i feel very , very lucky to have survived .
i 'm the only survivor in my family .
now i bring people here , " she said , her face almost permanently creased in a smile .
" i love life , and i want to pass that message on to others , " irene said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eldery man prays in auschwitz on thursday .
hungary only began mass deportations of jews late in the war , but once they began they were carried out with horrifying efficiency .
some 450,000 hungarian jews were killed at auschwitz , many sent directly to their deaths as soon as they arrived at the camp , packed like animals into cattle cars . " we did not reach out to the victims , we were not strong enough , " hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said at a private ceremony for his country 's victims .
" these atrocities were committed by no one other than us all , the human race , " he said . " this must not happen again " other marchers had come from australia , canada , france , greece , mexico , poland , south africa and beyond .
together , young and old , jewish and non-jewish , made their way under a grey sky and light drizzle out of auschwitz to birkenau to remember the victims of the holocaust . the festival atmosphere that had reigned before the shofar sounded was replaced by near silence , punctuated by thousands of footsteps on the dirt paths and cobbles leading out of auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants place candles on the rails at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living , an annual event to commemorate the atrocities of the holocaust , in 2002 .
" this is a reunion of a whole nation and those people who died here , " said eugenia spector , a 19-year-old ukrainian jew from odessa .
she said the laughter and song before the march was a way of letting off tension .
" some of the laughter and joking is just to relax .
when we went to the gas chamber , we had the feeling we were going to be gassed at any second .
after we visited the camp , we felt nervous and did n't know what to do , and we got rid of the tension by laughing , almost hysterically , " she said . jurek sternfeld , 66 , was in a group of 160 jewish people from around australia .
born in warsaw , six months before nazi germany invaded poland starting world war ii , the most deadly conflict in history , he was smuggled out of poland by his mother immediately after the start of the war .
his family spent the war in the soviet union , and survived the conflict intact - a rarity for polish jews . " i think this march is the right thing , as far as the future is concerned , to remember what happened .

" i am naturally very moved to be on the spot where the worst happened , " sharon told journalists accompanying him on his plane . survivors revisit torture chambers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of children in prisoners ' clothes stand behind barbed wire in the auschwitz concentration camp .
at auschwitz , thousands crowded into the camp , touring its gas chambers , torture cells , execution wall , the barracks into which the nazis crammed the first inmates . " i had to come here to see where my people were murdered , " an elderly woman from the southern us state of florida told afp , before breaking off abruptly , her voice wracked by sobs .
" now i see it and it 's horrible , " she said , apologizing for her tears . irene zattfild , of hungarian jewish extraction , was taking part in her fifth march of the living .
she was interned at auschwitz when she was 13 and lost her entire family here .
" i feel very , very lucky to have survived .
i 'm the only survivor in my family .
now i bring people here , " she said , her face almost permanently creased in a smile .
" i love life , and i want to pass that message on to others , " irene said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eldery man prays in auschwitz on thursday .
hungary only began mass deportations of jews late in the war , but once they began they were carried out with horrifying efficiency .
some 450,000 hungarian jews were killed at auschwitz , many sent directly to their deaths as soon as they arrived at the camp , packed like animals into cattle cars . " we did not reach out to the victims , we were not strong enough , " hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said at a private ceremony for his country 's victims .
" these atrocities were committed by no one other than us all , the human race , " he said . " this must not happen again " other marchers had come from australia , canada , france , greece , mexico , poland , south africa and beyond .
together , young and old , jewish and non-jewish , made their way under a grey sky and light drizzle out of auschwitz to birkenau to remember the victims of the holocaust . the festival atmosphere that had reigned before the shofar sounded was replaced by near silence , punctuated by thousands of footsteps on the dirt paths and cobbles leading out of auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants place candles on the rails at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living , an annual event to commemorate the atrocities of the holocaust , in 2002 .
" this is a reunion of a whole nation and those people who died here , " said eugenia spector , a 19-year-old ukrainian jew from odessa .
she said the laughter and song before the march was a way of letting off tension .
" some of the laughter and joking is just to relax .
when we went to the gas chamber , we had the feeling we were going to be gassed at any second .
after we visited the camp , we felt nervous and did n't know what to do , and we got rid of the tension by laughing , almost hysterically , " she said . jurek sternfeld , 66 , was in a group of 160 jewish people from around australia .
born in warsaw , six months before nazi germany invaded poland starting world war ii , the most deadly conflict in history , he was smuggled out of poland by his mother immediately after the start of the war .
his family spent the war in the soviet union , and survived the conflict intact - a rarity for polish jews . " i think this march is the right thing , as far as the future is concerned , to remember what happened .
as far as i 'm concerned this was the blackest point in the history of humankind .
a whole group of people was deliberately being wiped out .
this must not happen again and this is what motivates me to come here , " he said . the march of the living half an hour after the march had started , the crowd was still passing under the infamous arbeit macht frei gate at auschwitz and across the dirt paths of the camp onto the tarmacked road leading to birkenau , three kilometers -lrb- two miles -rrb- away . there , a memorial ceremony was to be held in the midst of the rubble of the purpose-built interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants holding israeli flags walk on the rails at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living .

back to first page back 2/2 right wing governments made a comeback slowly , however , the third way balloon deflated .
attitudes across europe changed in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states and subsequent elections in europe brought back conservative governments on the back of immigration and security issues .
soon blair and schröder would be members of a very exclusive club , the dwindling center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both schröder and blair managed to secure second terms , keeping the number of center-left governments in europe at five .
but both had fought their second elections with very different approaches to their first . blair was re-elected before sept .
11 in 2001 , but if he had waited until after the attacks , he may still have got in .
labor had drifted , or more correctly been steered further towards the right in its first four years in government under blair . blair moved further right on former tory support his reforms of the legal system - which some claimed cruelly curtailed civil liberties , the privatization of air traffic control , the encouragement of private investment in the public services , the imposition of commercial management on institutions such as the rail system and the competitive ethos on hospitals and schools could have been policies implemented by a conservative government .
indeed , while labor lost staunch support over such policies , blair continued to court the middle classes and picked up votes by attracting disillusioned voters who had abandoned the tories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany in 2002 , schröder narrowly avoided being booted out by adopting a hard line against the preparations for war in iraq and then still had to rely on a good showing by his green coalition partners to get the majority he needed to form a new government . while tony blair seemed to have found the right amount of blue to mix with his red , schröder was a mixture of colors and messages .
high unemployment and an ailing economy had forced him into considering an overhaul of the social welfare system - which went against his social democrat beliefs - while the growing storm of war had forced his hand in standing against the right-wing fervor of the ' coalition of the willing . ' second terms saw the third way floundering by their second terms , both blair and schröder were drifting further from their third way vision .
as a possible third term beckons for blair , and with schröder eyeing a third election in 2006 , do they still stand on the neue mitte four years down the line ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's support for the war in iraq , his siding with a republican president in the united states and increased curbs on civil liberties as part of justice reform all point to a stronger swing to the right since the last election . election 2005 sees blair blue and unabashed this time around , apparently liberated by his decision not to run again after these elections , blair is giving barely an inch on the more conservative parts of his agenda .
under his leadership , labor have abandoned public ownership and have made no secret of the desire to rely on competition and the private sector rather than state funding to supply public services , all things the 2005 election policies endorse . schröder , on the other hand , seems to be heading back to the left as a state election in the industrial heartland of north rhine westphalia looms on may 22 .
the spd seems to be scrambling to revive their left-wing credentials in a bid to avoid being booted out of one of the party 's traditional strongholds . schröder and comrades signal left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader müntefering has been added to marx , engels and lenin in this cartoon the spd have been seen to be riding to the defense of industry recently in response to this threat , with schröder and spd chairman franz müntefering advocating the outlawing of suggested " short-term " investment tactics - people " making quick money and moving on . " müntefering even prompted satirists to portray him as a friend of marx and lenin after a speech in april which all but officially dumped the neo-liberal ways of the neue mitte in favor of social responsibility .
more evidence of a return to more leftist ideals comes in the form of the spd 's sudden passion for a national minimum wage . with blair leading to the right and schröder leaning to the left , in terms of securing a third term for their parties , the third way looks like the path which will remain less trodden . nick amies , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair calls election on may 5 british prime minister tony blair , eager to lead his labor party to an unprecedented third straight term in power , ended weeks of speculation tuesday and called a general election for may 5 .

back to first page back 2/2 right wing governments made a comeback slowly , however , the third way balloon deflated .
attitudes across europe changed in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states and subsequent elections in europe brought back conservative governments on the back of immigration and security issues .
soon blair and schröder would be members of a very exclusive club , the dwindling center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both schröder and blair managed to secure second terms , keeping the number of center-left governments in europe at five .
but both had fought their second elections with very different approaches to their first . blair was re-elected before sept .

" our industry has seen a relatively stable level of sales - somewhere between negative 0.3 percent to zero percent sales growth , " said andreas bartmann , ceo of globetrotter , germany 's largest sporting goods and outdoor-equipment retailer .

despite overwhelming economic woes , the sector is surviving .
" of all those doing poorly , we 're doing best , " ott said with a laugh .

but with tony blair ’ s labour party set to win a third term on right-leaning policies , the question should be : " whatever happened to the third way ? " the 2005 british general election on thursday may seem to some voters as a step back in time .
just as it was in the 1997 election , in which tony blair first swept to office on the back of a euphoric landslide victory , the labor party is the unbeatable favorite while the opposition conservative party is in deep disarray . but it 's wrong to think that british politics has remained stuck in a time-warp since the late 1990s .
many things have changed , including the government that is running , and is likely to continue running , the country .
it may still be a labor government in name but much of the ideology associated with that name has been abandoned . to chart the change , one must start with that first landslide victory .
that heady summer of 1997 was filled with buzzwords cultivated by the bright young things on the left .
the labor party had been remade in blair 's image of new labor and socialism , a word and concept rendered unutterable by consecutive tory governments , had been replaced by the third way , a path between right and left which would allow market driven politics to be combined with social idealism . blairite masterminds had developed a strategy that would appeal to the traditional socialists and social democrats on the one hand and the advocates of thatcherite free-market conservatism on the other . courting middle england and the working class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third way promised the electorate a combination of conservative market orientation with the social idealism of the labor movement .
in place of arguments about the age-old ' tax and spend ' approach , the third way would deliver improved public services while lowering taxes .
while keeping the working classes sweet , blair was also courting middle england .

but with tony blair ’ s labour party set to win a third term on right-leaning policies , the question should be : " whatever happened to the third way ? " the 2005 british general election on thursday may seem to some voters as a step back in time .
just as it was in the 1997 election , in which tony blair first swept to office on the back of a euphoric landslide victory , the labor party is the unbeatable favorite while the opposition conservative party is in deep disarray . but it 's wrong to think that british politics has remained stuck in a time-warp since the late 1990s .
many things have changed , including the government that is running , and is likely to continue running , the country .
it may still be a labor government in name but much of the ideology associated with that name has been abandoned . to chart the change , one must start with that first landslide victory .
that heady summer of 1997 was filled with buzzwords cultivated by the bright young things on the left .
the labor party had been remade in blair 's image of new labor and socialism , a word and concept rendered unutterable by consecutive tory governments , had been replaced by the third way , a path between right and left which would allow market driven politics to be combined with social idealism . blairite masterminds had developed a strategy that would appeal to the traditional socialists and social democrats on the one hand and the advocates of thatcherite free-market conservatism on the other . courting middle england and the working class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third way promised the electorate a combination of conservative market orientation with the social idealism of the labor movement .
in place of arguments about the age-old ' tax and spend ' approach , the third way would deliver improved public services while lowering taxes .
while keeping the working classes sweet , blair was also courting middle england .
it worked beautifully . once in power , it was revealed that blair 's vision did n't end there .
at the end of the 1990s , 13 of the eu 's old 15 member states were run by center-left governments .
the british prime minister saw this as an opportunity to remake europe in the new labor image and with the continent wrapped up in the good feeling of sweeping decades of conservatism aside , blair set about spreading the third way .
he found willing participants in lionel jospin in france and giuliano amato in italy .
but few were more convinced at the time than newly elected german chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder joins wave of center-left optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democrats came into power in 1998 after 16 years in opposition to helmut kohl 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
schröder , a former chairman of the radical social democratic student association , fought and won the election on his pledges to bring economic stability and development to germany and to increase domestic security and continuity in foreign affairs . a charismatic young leader , schröder was quick to associate himself with tony blair and us president bill clinton as one of the " new breed " of center-left leaders who were driving their countries away from conservative governments which had been led by the likes of kohl , ronald reagan and margaret thatcher .
it did n't take long for schröder to be seduced by the third way . in june 1999 , schröder and blair came together to write and publish the center-left manifesto " europe : the third way / die neue mitte . "
the leaders of great britain and germany were now working together to advocate a change to the traditional policy instruments in areas such as the concept of social justice , the role of the state , the balance between individualism and collectivism , and entrepreneurial spirit .
it was an alternative model to the old labels of right and left and one that fitted the atmosphere of optimism which hung over europe as the new millennium dawned . please continue reading to find out about the third way 's demise 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair calls election on may 5 british prime minister tony blair , eager to lead his labor party to an unprecedented third straight term in power , ended weeks of speculation tuesday and called a general election for may 5 .

but many are suspicious of his motives ahead of crucial state polls .

back to first page back 2/2 right wing governments made a comeback slowly , however , the third way balloon deflated .
attitudes across europe changed in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states and subsequent elections in europe brought back conservative governments on the back of immigration and security issues .
soon blair and schröder would be members of a very exclusive club , the dwindling center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both schröder and blair managed to secure second terms , keeping the number of center-left governments in europe at five .
but both had fought their second elections with very different approaches to their first . blair was re-elected before sept .
11 in 2001 , but if he had waited until after the attacks , he may still have got in .
labor had drifted , or more correctly been steered further towards the right in its first four years in government under blair . blair moved further right on former tory support his reforms of the legal system - which some claimed cruelly curtailed civil liberties , the privatization of air traffic control , the encouragement of private investment in the public services , the imposition of commercial management on institutions such as the rail system and the competitive ethos on hospitals and schools could have been policies implemented by a conservative government .
indeed , while labor lost staunch support over such policies , blair continued to court the middle classes and picked up votes by attracting disillusioned voters who had abandoned the tories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany in 2002 , schröder narrowly avoided being booted out by adopting a hard line against the preparations for war in iraq and then still had to rely on a good showing by his green coalition partners to get the majority he needed to form a new government . while tony blair seemed to have found the right amount of blue to mix with his red , schröder was a mixture of colors and messages .
high unemployment and an ailing economy had forced him into considering an overhaul of the social welfare system - which went against his social democrat beliefs - while the growing storm of war had forced his hand in standing against the right-wing fervor of the ' coalition of the willing . ' second terms saw the third way floundering by their second terms , both blair and schröder were drifting further from their third way vision .
as a possible third term beckons for blair , and with schröder eyeing a third election in 2006 , do they still stand on the neue mitte four years down the line ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's support for the war in iraq , his siding with a republican president in the united states and increased curbs on civil liberties as part of justice reform all point to a stronger swing to the right since the last election . election 2005 sees blair blue and unabashed this time around , apparently liberated by his decision not to run again after these elections , blair is giving barely an inch on the more conservative parts of his agenda .
under his leadership , labor have abandoned public ownership and have made no secret of the desire to rely on competition and the private sector rather than state funding to supply public services , all things the 2005 election policies endorse . schröder , on the other hand , seems to be heading back to the left as a state election in the industrial heartland of north rhine westphalia looms on may 22 .
the spd seems to be scrambling to revive their left-wing credentials in a bid to avoid being booted out of one of the party 's traditional strongholds . schröder and comrades signal left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader müntefering has been added to marx , engels and lenin in this cartoon the spd have been seen to be riding to the defense of industry recently in response to this threat , with schröder and spd chairman franz müntefering advocating the outlawing of suggested " short-term " investment tactics - people " making quick money and moving on . " müntefering even prompted satirists to portray him as a friend of marx and lenin after a speech in april which all but officially dumped the neo-liberal ways of the neue mitte in favor of social responsibility .
more evidence of a return to more leftist ideals comes in the form of the spd 's sudden passion for a national minimum wage . with blair leading to the right and schröder leaning to the left , in terms of securing a third term for their parties , the third way looks like the path which will remain less trodden . nick amies , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair calls election on may 5 british prime minister tony blair , eager to lead his labor party to an unprecedented third straight term in power , ended weeks of speculation tuesday and called a general election for may 5 .

she said the laughter and song before the march was a way of letting off tension .
" some of the laughter and joking is just to relax .

after we visited the camp , we felt nervous and did n't know what to do , and we got rid of the tension by laughing , almost hysterically , " she said . jurek sternfeld , 66 , was in a group of 160 jewish people from around australia .
born in warsaw , six months before nazi germany invaded poland starting world war ii , the most deadly conflict in history , he was smuggled out of poland by his mother immediately after the start of the war .
his family spent the war in the soviet union , and survived the conflict intact - a rarity for polish jews . " i think this march is the right thing , as far as the future is concerned , to remember what happened .

this must not happen again and this is what motivates me to come here , " he said . the march of the living half an hour after the march had started , the crowd was still passing under the infamous arbeit macht frei gate at auschwitz and across the dirt paths of the camp onto the tarmacked road leading to birkenau , three kilometers -lrb- two miles -rrb- away . there , a memorial ceremony was to be held in the midst of the rubble of the purpose-built interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants holding israeli flags walk on the rails at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living .

" we 'll take the message back to our students and everyone we meet in our lives , to make sure we never forget and it never happens again .

travel researcher aderhold explained said that in the past , a german retiree 's vacation consisted of sitting in his backyard .
today , " a 65 year old will do things that they would n't have done years ago , " he said .
" a hiking tour in south america or something , they 're doing activities that we used to associate with 30- or 40-year-olds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiking seniors and retirees who take such trips tend to be at an age where they can afford high quality clothing and equipment .
" they want the best textiles , nice bags , good shoes , " globetrotter 's bartmann said .
" and they want sales assistance . "
another booming sector is families , bartmann said .
even if most people do chose relaxation trips , many are opting for " adventurous " activities like canoe trips and camping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : camping family the sector has increased noticeably over the past five years , bartmann noted .
" you come into our store on a friday night and it is just full of families with children .
in the end it may still be a small segment of the market , but previously it did n't exist at all .
so it is very important for our sales . "
trying to make the most out of this development , outdoor companies increasingly aim their marketing campaigns at families .
one example is the cooperation jack wolfskin , germany 's largest outdoor goods manufacturer , started with mercedes benz in 2004 to offer an outdoor-sports competition for families .
and retailers such as globetrotter and the cologne-based blackfoot regularly offer classes and seminars aimed at families .
nostalgic trend also , the renewed interest in the great outdoors may be part of a general nostalgic trend sweeping through germany , according to travel researcher aderhold .
" younger people are n't rejecting the home market anymore , " he said .
" the alps , in germany as well as austria and switzerland , are back in fashion to some extent . "
finally - and possibly most importantly - the retailers note that what once counted as a specialist product now has a much larger use in the marketplace .
businessmen carry backpacks , kids wear gore-tex hiking boots to school , and housewives put on their ultra-light , breathable , all-weather jacket to go to the market .
" it used to be these things were just for the hardcore outdoorsman , " bartmann said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.05.2005 swapping the third way for a third term ? 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going seperate ways : schröder now on the left , blair on the right the third way was billed as the way forward for europe ’ s center-left .
but with tony blair ’ s labour party set to win a third term on right-leaning policies , the question should be : " whatever happened to the third way ? " the 2005 british general election on thursday may seem to some voters as a step back in time .
just as it was in the 1997 election , in which tony blair first swept to office on the back of a euphoric landslide victory , the labor party is the unbeatable favorite while the opposition conservative party is in deep disarray . but it 's wrong to think that british politics has remained stuck in a time-warp since the late 1990s .
many things have changed , including the government that is running , and is likely to continue running , the country .
it may still be a labor government in name but much of the ideology associated with that name has been abandoned . to chart the change , one must start with that first landslide victory .
that heady summer of 1997 was filled with buzzwords cultivated by the bright young things on the left .
the labor party had been remade in blair 's image of new labor and socialism , a word and concept rendered unutterable by consecutive tory governments , had been replaced by the third way , a path between right and left which would allow market driven politics to be combined with social idealism . blairite masterminds had developed a strategy that would appeal to the traditional socialists and social democrats on the one hand and the advocates of thatcherite free-market conservatism on the other . courting middle england and the working class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third way promised the electorate a combination of conservative market orientation with the social idealism of the labor movement .
in place of arguments about the age-old ' tax and spend ' approach , the third way would deliver improved public services while lowering taxes .
while keeping the working classes sweet , blair was also courting middle england .
it worked beautifully . once in power , it was revealed that blair 's vision did n't end there .
at the end of the 1990s , 13 of the eu 's old 15 member states were run by center-left governments .
the british prime minister saw this as an opportunity to remake europe in the new labor image and with the continent wrapped up in the good feeling of sweeping decades of conservatism aside , blair set about spreading the third way .
he found willing participants in lionel jospin in france and giuliano amato in italy .
but few were more convinced at the time than newly elected german chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder joins wave of center-left optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democrats came into power in 1998 after 16 years in opposition to helmut kohl 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
schröder , a former chairman of the radical social democratic student association , fought and won the election on his pledges to bring economic stability and development to germany and to increase domestic security and continuity in foreign affairs . a charismatic young leader , schröder was quick to associate himself with tony blair and us president bill clinton as one of the " new breed " of center-left leaders who were driving their countries away from conservative governments which had been led by the likes of kohl , ronald reagan and margaret thatcher .
it did n't take long for schröder to be seduced by the third way . in june 1999 , schröder and blair came together to write and publish the center-left manifesto " europe : the third way / die neue mitte . "
the leaders of great britain and germany were now working together to advocate a change to the traditional policy instruments in areas such as the concept of social justice , the role of the state , the balance between individualism and collectivism , and entrepreneurial spirit .
it was an alternative model to the old labels of right and left and one that fitted the atmosphere of optimism which hung over europe as the new millennium dawned . please continue reading to find out about the third way 's demise 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair calls election on may 5 british prime minister tony blair , eager to lead his labor party to an unprecedented third straight term in power , ended weeks of speculation tuesday and called a general election for may 5 .

but with tony blair ’ s labour party set to win a third term on right-leaning policies , the question should be : " whatever happened to the third way ? " the 2005 british general election on thursday may seem to some voters as a step back in time .
just as it was in the 1997 election , in which tony blair first swept to office on the back of a euphoric landslide victory , the labor party is the unbeatable favorite while the opposition conservative party is in deep disarray . but it 's wrong to think that british politics has remained stuck in a time-warp since the late 1990s .
many things have changed , including the government that is running , and is likely to continue running , the country .
it may still be a labor government in name but much of the ideology associated with that name has been abandoned . to chart the change , one must start with that first landslide victory .
that heady summer of 1997 was filled with buzzwords cultivated by the bright young things on the left .
the labor party had been remade in blair 's image of new labor and socialism , a word and concept rendered unutterable by consecutive tory governments , had been replaced by the third way , a path between right and left which would allow market driven politics to be combined with social idealism . blairite masterminds had developed a strategy that would appeal to the traditional socialists and social democrats on the one hand and the advocates of thatcherite free-market conservatism on the other . courting middle england and the working class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third way promised the electorate a combination of conservative market orientation with the social idealism of the labor movement .
in place of arguments about the age-old ' tax and spend ' approach , the third way would deliver improved public services while lowering taxes .
while keeping the working classes sweet , blair was also courting middle england .
it worked beautifully . once in power , it was revealed that blair 's vision did n't end there .
at the end of the 1990s , 13 of the eu 's old 15 member states were run by center-left governments .
the british prime minister saw this as an opportunity to remake europe in the new labor image and with the continent wrapped up in the good feeling of sweeping decades of conservatism aside , blair set about spreading the third way .
he found willing participants in lionel jospin in france and giuliano amato in italy .
but few were more convinced at the time than newly elected german chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder joins wave of center-left optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democrats came into power in 1998 after 16 years in opposition to helmut kohl 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
schröder , a former chairman of the radical social democratic student association , fought and won the election on his pledges to bring economic stability and development to germany and to increase domestic security and continuity in foreign affairs . a charismatic young leader , schröder was quick to associate himself with tony blair and us president bill clinton as one of the " new breed " of center-left leaders who were driving their countries away from conservative governments which had been led by the likes of kohl , ronald reagan and margaret thatcher .
it did n't take long for schröder to be seduced by the third way . in june 1999 , schröder and blair came together to write and publish the center-left manifesto " europe : the third way / die neue mitte . "
the leaders of great britain and germany were now working together to advocate a change to the traditional policy instruments in areas such as the concept of social justice , the role of the state , the balance between individualism and collectivism , and entrepreneurial spirit .

travel researcher aderhold explained said that in the past , a german retiree 's vacation consisted of sitting in his backyard .
today , " a 65 year old will do things that they would n't have done years ago , " he said .
" a hiking tour in south america or something , they 're doing activities that we used to associate with 30- or 40-year-olds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiking seniors and retirees who take such trips tend to be at an age where they can afford high quality clothing and equipment .
" they want the best textiles , nice bags , good shoes , " globetrotter 's bartmann said .
" and they want sales assistance . "
another booming sector is families , bartmann said .
even if most people do chose relaxation trips , many are opting for " adventurous " activities like canoe trips and camping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : camping family the sector has increased noticeably over the past five years , bartmann noted .
" you come into our store on a friday night and it is just full of families with children .
in the end it may still be a small segment of the market , but previously it did n't exist at all .
so it is very important for our sales . "
trying to make the most out of this development , outdoor companies increasingly aim their marketing campaigns at families .
one example is the cooperation jack wolfskin , germany 's largest outdoor goods manufacturer , started with mercedes benz in 2004 to offer an outdoor-sports competition for families .
and retailers such as globetrotter and the cologne-based blackfoot regularly offer classes and seminars aimed at families .
nostalgic trend also , the renewed interest in the great outdoors may be part of a general nostalgic trend sweeping through germany , according to travel researcher aderhold .
" younger people are n't rejecting the home market anymore , " he said .
" the alps , in germany as well as austria and switzerland , are back in fashion to some extent . "
finally - and possibly most importantly - the retailers note that what once counted as a specialist product now has a much larger use in the marketplace .
businessmen carry backpacks , kids wear gore-tex hiking boots to school , and housewives put on their ultra-light , breathable , all-weather jacket to go to the market .
" it used to be these things were just for the hardcore outdoorsman , " bartmann said .
" that 's just not the case anymore .

back to first page back 2/2 right wing governments made a comeback slowly , however , the third way balloon deflated .
attitudes across europe changed in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states and subsequent elections in europe brought back conservative governments on the back of immigration and security issues .
soon blair and schröder would be members of a very exclusive club , the dwindling center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both schröder and blair managed to secure second terms , keeping the number of center-left governments in europe at five .
but both had fought their second elections with very different approaches to their first . blair was re-elected before sept .
11 in 2001 , but if he had waited until after the attacks , he may still have got in .
labor had drifted , or more correctly been steered further towards the right in its first four years in government under blair . blair moved further right on former tory support his reforms of the legal system - which some claimed cruelly curtailed civil liberties , the privatization of air traffic control , the encouragement of private investment in the public services , the imposition of commercial management on institutions such as the rail system and the competitive ethos on hospitals and schools could have been policies implemented by a conservative government .
indeed , while labor lost staunch support over such policies , blair continued to court the middle classes and picked up votes by attracting disillusioned voters who had abandoned the tories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany in 2002 , schröder narrowly avoided being booted out by adopting a hard line against the preparations for war in iraq and then still had to rely on a good showing by his green coalition partners to get the majority he needed to form a new government . while tony blair seemed to have found the right amount of blue to mix with his red , schröder was a mixture of colors and messages .
high unemployment and an ailing economy had forced him into considering an overhaul of the social welfare system - which went against his social democrat beliefs - while the growing storm of war had forced his hand in standing against the right-wing fervor of the ' coalition of the willing . ' second terms saw the third way floundering by their second terms , both blair and schröder were drifting further from their third way vision .
as a possible third term beckons for blair , and with schröder eyeing a third election in 2006 , do they still stand on the neue mitte four years down the line ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's support for the war in iraq , his siding with a republican president in the united states and increased curbs on civil liberties as part of justice reform all point to a stronger swing to the right since the last election . election 2005 sees blair blue and unabashed this time around , apparently liberated by his decision not to run again after these elections , blair is giving barely an inch on the more conservative parts of his agenda .
under his leadership , labor have abandoned public ownership and have made no secret of the desire to rely on competition and the private sector rather than state funding to supply public services , all things the 2005 election policies endorse . schröder , on the other hand , seems to be heading back to the left as a state election in the industrial heartland of north rhine westphalia looms on may 22 .
the spd seems to be scrambling to revive their left-wing credentials in a bid to avoid being booted out of one of the party 's traditional strongholds . schröder and comrades signal left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader müntefering has been added to marx , engels and lenin in this cartoon the spd have been seen to be riding to the defense of industry recently in response to this threat , with schröder and spd chairman franz müntefering advocating the outlawing of suggested " short-term " investment tactics - people " making quick money and moving on . " müntefering even prompted satirists to portray him as a friend of marx and lenin after a speech in april which all but officially dumped the neo-liberal ways of the neue mitte in favor of social responsibility .
more evidence of a return to more leftist ideals comes in the form of the spd 's sudden passion for a national minimum wage . with blair leading to the right and schröder leaning to the left , in terms of securing a third term for their parties , the third way looks like the path which will remain less trodden . nick amies , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair calls election on may 5 british prime minister tony blair , eager to lead his labor party to an unprecedented third straight term in power , ended weeks of speculation tuesday and called a general election for may 5 .

" i am naturally very moved to be on the spot where the worst happened , " sharon told journalists accompanying him on his plane . survivors revisit torture chambers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of children in prisoners ' clothes stand behind barbed wire in the auschwitz concentration camp .
at auschwitz , thousands crowded into the camp , touring its gas chambers , torture cells , execution wall , the barracks into which the nazis crammed the first inmates . " i had to come here to see where my people were murdered , " an elderly woman from the southern us state of florida told afp , before breaking off abruptly , her voice wracked by sobs .
" now i see it and it 's horrible , " she said , apologizing for her tears . irene zattfild , of hungarian jewish extraction , was taking part in her fifth march of the living .
she was interned at auschwitz when she was 13 and lost her entire family here .

hungary only began mass deportations of jews late in the war , but once they began they were carried out with horrifying efficiency .
some 450,000 hungarian jews were killed at auschwitz , many sent directly to their deaths as soon as they arrived at the camp , packed like animals into cattle cars . " we did not reach out to the victims , we were not strong enough , " hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said at a private ceremony for his country 's victims .
" these atrocities were committed by no one other than us all , the human race , " he said . " this must not happen again " other marchers had come from australia , canada , france , greece , mexico , poland , south africa and beyond .
together , young and old , jewish and non-jewish , made their way under a grey sky and light drizzle out of auschwitz to birkenau to remember the victims of the holocaust . the festival atmosphere that had reigned before the shofar sounded was replaced by near silence , punctuated by thousands of footsteps on the dirt paths and cobbles leading out of auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants place candles on the rails at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living , an annual event to commemorate the atrocities of the holocaust , in 2002 .

she said the laughter and song before the march was a way of letting off tension .
" some of the laughter and joking is just to relax .
when we went to the gas chamber , we had the feeling we were going to be gassed at any second .
after we visited the camp , we felt nervous and did n't know what to do , and we got rid of the tension by laughing , almost hysterically , " she said . jurek sternfeld , 66 , was in a group of 160 jewish people from around australia .
born in warsaw , six months before nazi germany invaded poland starting world war ii , the most deadly conflict in history , he was smuggled out of poland by his mother immediately after the start of the war .
his family spent the war in the soviet union , and survived the conflict intact - a rarity for polish jews . " i think this march is the right thing , as far as the future is concerned , to remember what happened .
as far as i 'm concerned this was the blackest point in the history of humankind .
a whole group of people was deliberately being wiped out .
this must not happen again and this is what motivates me to come here , " he said . the march of the living half an hour after the march had started , the crowd was still passing under the infamous arbeit macht frei gate at auschwitz and across the dirt paths of the camp onto the tarmacked road leading to birkenau , three kilometers -lrb- two miles -rrb- away . there , a memorial ceremony was to be held in the midst of the rubble of the purpose-built interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants holding israeli flags walk on the rails at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living .

" the march is a chance for us to show that we remember and to be here on such a historical occasion - the 60th anniversary of the end of the war , " said toby harkleroad , a teacher from washington dc .
" we 'll take the message back to our students and everyone we meet in our lives , to make sure we never forget and it never happens again .

" i am naturally very moved to be on the spot where the worst happened , " sharon told journalists accompanying him on his plane . survivors revisit torture chambers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of children in prisoners ' clothes stand behind barbed wire in the auschwitz concentration camp .
at auschwitz , thousands crowded into the camp , touring its gas chambers , torture cells , execution wall , the barracks into which the nazis crammed the first inmates . " i had to come here to see where my people were murdered , " an elderly woman from the southern us state of florida told afp , before breaking off abruptly , her voice wracked by sobs .
" now i see it and it 's horrible , " she said , apologizing for her tears . irene zattfild , of hungarian jewish extraction , was taking part in her fifth march of the living .
she was interned at auschwitz when she was 13 and lost her entire family here .
" i feel very , very lucky to have survived .
i 'm the only survivor in my family .
now i bring people here , " she said , her face almost permanently creased in a smile .
" i love life , and i want to pass that message on to others , " irene said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eldery man prays in auschwitz on thursday .
hungary only began mass deportations of jews late in the war , but once they began they were carried out with horrifying efficiency .
some 450,000 hungarian jews were killed at auschwitz , many sent directly to their deaths as soon as they arrived at the camp , packed like animals into cattle cars . " we did not reach out to the victims , we were not strong enough , " hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said at a private ceremony for his country 's victims .
" these atrocities were committed by no one other than us all , the human race , " he said . " this must not happen again " other marchers had come from australia , canada , france , greece , mexico , poland , south africa and beyond .
together , young and old , jewish and non-jewish , made their way under a grey sky and light drizzle out of auschwitz to birkenau to remember the victims of the holocaust . the festival atmosphere that had reigned before the shofar sounded was replaced by near silence , punctuated by thousands of footsteps on the dirt paths and cobbles leading out of auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants place candles on the rails at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living , an annual event to commemorate the atrocities of the holocaust , in 2002 .
" this is a reunion of a whole nation and those people who died here , " said eugenia spector , a 19-year-old ukrainian jew from odessa .
she said the laughter and song before the march was a way of letting off tension .
" some of the laughter and joking is just to relax .
when we went to the gas chamber , we had the feeling we were going to be gassed at any second .
after we visited the camp , we felt nervous and did n't know what to do , and we got rid of the tension by laughing , almost hysterically , " she said . jurek sternfeld , 66 , was in a group of 160 jewish people from around australia .
born in warsaw , six months before nazi germany invaded poland starting world war ii , the most deadly conflict in history , he was smuggled out of poland by his mother immediately after the start of the war .
his family spent the war in the soviet union , and survived the conflict intact - a rarity for polish jews . " i think this march is the right thing , as far as the future is concerned , to remember what happened .
as far as i 'm concerned this was the blackest point in the history of humankind .
a whole group of people was deliberately being wiped out .
this must not happen again and this is what motivates me to come here , " he said . the march of the living half an hour after the march had started , the crowd was still passing under the infamous arbeit macht frei gate at auschwitz and across the dirt paths of the camp onto the tarmacked road leading to birkenau , three kilometers -lrb- two miles -rrb- away . there , a memorial ceremony was to be held in the midst of the rubble of the purpose-built interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants holding israeli flags walk on the rails at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living .
a group of roman catholic school teachers from the united states was also among the marchers .
" the march is a chance for us to show that we remember and to be here on such a historical occasion - the 60th anniversary of the end of the war , " said toby harkleroad , a teacher from washington dc .
" we 'll take the message back to our students and everyone we meet in our lives , to make sure we never forget and it never happens again .
especially as catholics , we have to look back at the role we might have played in setting the world up for such a tragedy happening , what we did or did not do , " he said . wartime pope pius xvi did not denounce the nazi persecution of the jews . the nazis exterminated six million european jews , half of them from mainly catholic poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . the march of the living began in 1988 to counter voices denying that the holocaust ever took place . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de auschwitz march to recall holocaust victims thousands of people from some 50 countries have begun converging on southern poland to take part thursday in a march in memory of holocaust victims at auschwitz-birkenau , the most grimly efficient of nazi death camps .

but with tony blair ’ s labour party set to win a third term on right-leaning policies , the question should be : " whatever happened to the third way ? " the 2005 british general election on thursday may seem to some voters as a step back in time .
just as it was in the 1997 election , in which tony blair first swept to office on the back of a euphoric landslide victory , the labor party is the unbeatable favorite while the opposition conservative party is in deep disarray . but it 's wrong to think that british politics has remained stuck in a time-warp since the late 1990s .

" a hiking tour in south america or something , they 're doing activities that we used to associate with 30- or 40-year-olds . "

" the alps , in germany as well as austria and switzerland , are back in fashion to some extent . "
finally - and possibly most importantly - the retailers note that what once counted as a specialist product now has a much larger use in the marketplace .
businessmen carry backpacks , kids wear gore-tex hiking boots to school , and housewives put on their ultra-light , breathable , all-weather jacket to go to the market .

but with tony blair ’ s labour party set to win a third term on right-leaning policies , the question should be : " whatever happened to the third way ? " the 2005 british general election on thursday may seem to some voters as a step back in time .
just as it was in the 1997 election , in which tony blair first swept to office on the back of a euphoric landslide victory , the labor party is the unbeatable favorite while the opposition conservative party is in deep disarray . but it 's wrong to think that british politics has remained stuck in a time-warp since the late 1990s .
many things have changed , including the government that is running , and is likely to continue running , the country .
it may still be a labor government in name but much of the ideology associated with that name has been abandoned . to chart the change , one must start with that first landslide victory .
that heady summer of 1997 was filled with buzzwords cultivated by the bright young things on the left .
the labor party had been remade in blair 's image of new labor and socialism , a word and concept rendered unutterable by consecutive tory governments , had been replaced by the third way , a path between right and left which would allow market driven politics to be combined with social idealism . blairite masterminds had developed a strategy that would appeal to the traditional socialists and social democrats on the one hand and the advocates of thatcherite free-market conservatism on the other . courting middle england and the working class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third way promised the electorate a combination of conservative market orientation with the social idealism of the labor movement .
in place of arguments about the age-old ' tax and spend ' approach , the third way would deliver improved public services while lowering taxes .
while keeping the working classes sweet , blair was also courting middle england .
it worked beautifully . once in power , it was revealed that blair 's vision did n't end there .
at the end of the 1990s , 13 of the eu 's old 15 member states were run by center-left governments .
the british prime minister saw this as an opportunity to remake europe in the new labor image and with the continent wrapped up in the good feeling of sweeping decades of conservatism aside , blair set about spreading the third way .
he found willing participants in lionel jospin in france and giuliano amato in italy .
but few were more convinced at the time than newly elected german chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder joins wave of center-left optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democrats came into power in 1998 after 16 years in opposition to helmut kohl 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
schröder , a former chairman of the radical social democratic student association , fought and won the election on his pledges to bring economic stability and development to germany and to increase domestic security and continuity in foreign affairs . a charismatic young leader , schröder was quick to associate himself with tony blair and us president bill clinton as one of the " new breed " of center-left leaders who were driving their countries away from conservative governments which had been led by the likes of kohl , ronald reagan and margaret thatcher .
it did n't take long for schröder to be seduced by the third way . in june 1999 , schröder and blair came together to write and publish the center-left manifesto " europe : the third way / die neue mitte . "
the leaders of great britain and germany were now working together to advocate a change to the traditional policy instruments in areas such as the concept of social justice , the role of the state , the balance between individualism and collectivism , and entrepreneurial spirit .
it was an alternative model to the old labels of right and left and one that fitted the atmosphere of optimism which hung over europe as the new millennium dawned . please continue reading to find out about the third way 's demise 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair calls election on may 5 british prime minister tony blair , eager to lead his labor party to an unprecedented third straight term in power , ended weeks of speculation tuesday and called a general election for may 5 .

travel researcher aderhold explained said that in the past , a german retiree 's vacation consisted of sitting in his backyard .

" i am naturally very moved to be on the spot where the worst happened , " sharon told journalists accompanying him on his plane . survivors revisit torture chambers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of children in prisoners ' clothes stand behind barbed wire in the auschwitz concentration camp .
at auschwitz , thousands crowded into the camp , touring its gas chambers , torture cells , execution wall , the barracks into which the nazis crammed the first inmates . " i had to come here to see where my people were murdered , " an elderly woman from the southern us state of florida told afp , before breaking off abruptly , her voice wracked by sobs .
" now i see it and it 's horrible , " she said , apologizing for her tears . irene zattfild , of hungarian jewish extraction , was taking part in her fifth march of the living .
she was interned at auschwitz when she was 13 and lost her entire family here .
" i feel very , very lucky to have survived .
i 'm the only survivor in my family .
now i bring people here , " she said , her face almost permanently creased in a smile .
" i love life , and i want to pass that message on to others , " irene said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eldery man prays in auschwitz on thursday .
hungary only began mass deportations of jews late in the war , but once they began they were carried out with horrifying efficiency .
some 450,000 hungarian jews were killed at auschwitz , many sent directly to their deaths as soon as they arrived at the camp , packed like animals into cattle cars . " we did not reach out to the victims , we were not strong enough , " hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said at a private ceremony for his country 's victims .
" these atrocities were committed by no one other than us all , the human race , " he said . " this must not happen again " other marchers had come from australia , canada , france , greece , mexico , poland , south africa and beyond .
together , young and old , jewish and non-jewish , made their way under a grey sky and light drizzle out of auschwitz to birkenau to remember the victims of the holocaust . the festival atmosphere that had reigned before the shofar sounded was replaced by near silence , punctuated by thousands of footsteps on the dirt paths and cobbles leading out of auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants place candles on the rails at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living , an annual event to commemorate the atrocities of the holocaust , in 2002 .
" this is a reunion of a whole nation and those people who died here , " said eugenia spector , a 19-year-old ukrainian jew from odessa .
she said the laughter and song before the march was a way of letting off tension .
" some of the laughter and joking is just to relax .
when we went to the gas chamber , we had the feeling we were going to be gassed at any second .
after we visited the camp , we felt nervous and did n't know what to do , and we got rid of the tension by laughing , almost hysterically , " she said . jurek sternfeld , 66 , was in a group of 160 jewish people from around australia .
born in warsaw , six months before nazi germany invaded poland starting world war ii , the most deadly conflict in history , he was smuggled out of poland by his mother immediately after the start of the war .
his family spent the war in the soviet union , and survived the conflict intact - a rarity for polish jews . " i think this march is the right thing , as far as the future is concerned , to remember what happened .
as far as i 'm concerned this was the blackest point in the history of humankind .
a whole group of people was deliberately being wiped out .
this must not happen again and this is what motivates me to come here , " he said . the march of the living half an hour after the march had started , the crowd was still passing under the infamous arbeit macht frei gate at auschwitz and across the dirt paths of the camp onto the tarmacked road leading to birkenau , three kilometers -lrb- two miles -rrb- away . there , a memorial ceremony was to be held in the midst of the rubble of the purpose-built interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants holding israeli flags walk on the rails at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living .
a group of roman catholic school teachers from the united states was also among the marchers .
" the march is a chance for us to show that we remember and to be here on such a historical occasion - the 60th anniversary of the end of the war , " said toby harkleroad , a teacher from washington dc .
" we 'll take the message back to our students and everyone we meet in our lives , to make sure we never forget and it never happens again .
especially as catholics , we have to look back at the role we might have played in setting the world up for such a tragedy happening , what we did or did not do , " he said . wartime pope pius xvi did not denounce the nazi persecution of the jews . the nazis exterminated six million european jews , half of them from mainly catholic poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . the march of the living began in 1988 to counter voices denying that the holocaust ever took place . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de auschwitz march to recall holocaust victims thousands of people from some 50 countries have begun converging on southern poland to take part thursday in a march in memory of holocaust victims at auschwitz-birkenau , the most grimly efficient of nazi death camps .

these days , there is a mind boggling array of outdoor sports and leisure activities on offer to average folks : mountainbiking , canyoning , rock climbing , nordic walking , hiking , windsurfing , kayaking , canoeing , sailing - the list just keeps getting longer .
and the market share of outdoor products -lrb- a subset of the sporting goods industry , -rrb- keeps growing right along with it .
stable sales outdoor products have become responsible for 31 percent of the overall sporting goods market , up from 27 percent in 2001 .
and while most german retail sectors saw decreased sales over the past year , revenues in the outdoor sector remained relatively stable , totaling 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.94 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
" our industry has seen a relatively stable level of sales - somewhere between negative 0.3 percent to zero percent sales growth , " said andreas bartmann , ceo of globetrotter , germany 's largest sporting goods and outdoor-equipment retailer .
" but other industries have had it much worse .
the textile industry was down a full 2 percent last year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walkers in munich in general , germans are an outdoorsy lot .
on ascension day this thursday , a national holiday in germany , millions will head outside .
the sunday afternoon hike is a time-honored family tradition , and sports clubs are a widely used social outlet .
this is reflected in the overall sales of sporting goods , said helmut ott , who heads up the alliance of german sporting goods dealers .
despite overwhelming economic woes , the sector is surviving .
" of all those doing poorly , we 're doing best , " ott said with a laugh .
sales in the " basics " - soccer shoes and shirts for example - are still selling , he said .
" but for the time being , outdoors equipment brings in the most money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchibo branch office in dortmund he noted that the industry is feeling a lot of pressure from massive discount chains like aldi , lidl and tchibo .
these companies sell low-cost food or coffee , but in addition they bring out a limited number of nonfood items each week .
the shopper who stays on top of the changing product lines can buy in-line skates , hiking boots , an all-weather jacket , pocket knife , tent or riding jodhpurs for a fraction of what they would cost in a sporting goods shop .
the pressure has meant that some smaller stores have been squeezed out of the sector altogether .
the secret of survival ?
do n't try to compete with discounters by lowering prices and slashing staff , said globetrotter 's bartmann .
" the stores that succeed have a different concept , " he said .
" they 've made going into the store an emotional experience , one that gives you the feeling of the outdoors . "
bildunterschrift : globetrotter 's climbing window a case in point is globetrotter 's hamburg store , which has an outdoor-adventure ambiance and features a built-in climbing wall -lrb- above -rrb- , a multi-surface walking course for testing hiking boots , and a plant-filled cafe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tarantula and python at globetrotter the 've gone so far as to pulled in mongolian musicians to promote trekking in asia , and had animal handlers on hand to show off the snakes and spiders one might run into in the forests of central america .
the company , which employs 600 people in germany , has seen sales rise 18 percent over the past four years , to around 100 million euros at the end of february .
at the cologne branch of the retail chain outdoor , which opened in 2004 , manager maurice goddar said sales have been booming .
he attributed the success to the fact that the store offers expert customer advice as well as replacement parts .
" at some point people want quality , " goddar said .
" and then they come to us . "
" nordic walking is huge " at his store , " tents are big sellers even though we are in the middle of the city , " he said .
" do n't ask me why .
people in their 20s buy a lot of climbing equipment .
and the whole nordic walking thing has been huge . "
but peter aderhold , chief of the travel and holiday research group , cautioned that it is wrong to assume germans are taking more active vacations just because outdoor retailers ' cash registers are ringing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german vacationer in cuxhaven in fact , " with daily stress levels increasing due to the uncertain job market , and the fact that people are working so much ... the trend in the german travel market is toward lower activity vacations - sitting on the beach eating ice cream rather than doing some exotic trek , " he said .

but with tony blair ’ s labour party set to win a third term on right-leaning policies , the question should be : " whatever happened to the third way ? " the 2005 british general election on thursday may seem to some voters as a step back in time .
just as it was in the 1997 election , in which tony blair first swept to office on the back of a euphoric landslide victory , the labor party is the unbeatable favorite while the opposition conservative party is in deep disarray . but it 's wrong to think that british politics has remained stuck in a time-warp since the late 1990s .
many things have changed , including the government that is running , and is likely to continue running , the country .

but with tony blair ’ s labour party set to win a third term on right-leaning policies , the question should be : " whatever happened to the third way ? " the 2005 british general election on thursday may seem to some voters as a step back in time .
just as it was in the 1997 election , in which tony blair first swept to office on the back of a euphoric landslide victory , the labor party is the unbeatable favorite while the opposition conservative party is in deep disarray . but it 's wrong to think that british politics has remained stuck in a time-warp since the late 1990s .
many things have changed , including the government that is running , and is likely to continue running , the country .
it may still be a labor government in name but much of the ideology associated with that name has been abandoned . to chart the change , one must start with that first landslide victory .
that heady summer of 1997 was filled with buzzwords cultivated by the bright young things on the left .
the labor party had been remade in blair 's image of new labor and socialism , a word and concept rendered unutterable by consecutive tory governments , had been replaced by the third way , a path between right and left which would allow market driven politics to be combined with social idealism . blairite masterminds had developed a strategy that would appeal to the traditional socialists and social democrats on the one hand and the advocates of thatcherite free-market conservatism on the other . courting middle england and the working class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third way promised the electorate a combination of conservative market orientation with the social idealism of the labor movement .

at the end of the 1990s , 13 of the eu 's old 15 member states were run by center-left governments .
the british prime minister saw this as an opportunity to remake europe in the new labor image and with the continent wrapped up in the good feeling of sweeping decades of conservatism aside , blair set about spreading the third way .
he found willing participants in lionel jospin in france and giuliano amato in italy .

schröder , a former chairman of the radical social democratic student association , fought and won the election on his pledges to bring economic stability and development to germany and to increase domestic security and continuity in foreign affairs . a charismatic young leader , schröder was quick to associate himself with tony blair and us president bill clinton as one of the " new breed " of center-left leaders who were driving their countries away from conservative governments which had been led by the likes of kohl , ronald reagan and margaret thatcher .
it did n't take long for schröder to be seduced by the third way . in june 1999 , schröder and blair came together to write and publish the center-left manifesto " europe : the third way / die neue mitte . "

but with tony blair ’ s labour party set to win a third term on right-leaning policies , the question should be : " whatever happened to the third way ? " the 2005 british general election on thursday may seem to some voters as a step back in time .
just as it was in the 1997 election , in which tony blair first swept to office on the back of a euphoric landslide victory , the labor party is the unbeatable favorite while the opposition conservative party is in deep disarray . but it 's wrong to think that british politics has remained stuck in a time-warp since the late 1990s .
many things have changed , including the government that is running , and is likely to continue running , the country .
it may still be a labor government in name but much of the ideology associated with that name has been abandoned . to chart the change , one must start with that first landslide victory .
that heady summer of 1997 was filled with buzzwords cultivated by the bright young things on the left .
the labor party had been remade in blair 's image of new labor and socialism , a word and concept rendered unutterable by consecutive tory governments , had been replaced by the third way , a path between right and left which would allow market driven politics to be combined with social idealism . blairite masterminds had developed a strategy that would appeal to the traditional socialists and social democrats on the one hand and the advocates of thatcherite free-market conservatism on the other . courting middle england and the working class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third way promised the electorate a combination of conservative market orientation with the social idealism of the labor movement .
in place of arguments about the age-old ' tax and spend ' approach , the third way would deliver improved public services while lowering taxes .
while keeping the working classes sweet , blair was also courting middle england .
it worked beautifully . once in power , it was revealed that blair 's vision did n't end there .
at the end of the 1990s , 13 of the eu 's old 15 member states were run by center-left governments .
the british prime minister saw this as an opportunity to remake europe in the new labor image and with the continent wrapped up in the good feeling of sweeping decades of conservatism aside , blair set about spreading the third way .
he found willing participants in lionel jospin in france and giuliano amato in italy .
but few were more convinced at the time than newly elected german chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder joins wave of center-left optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democrats came into power in 1998 after 16 years in opposition to helmut kohl 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
schröder , a former chairman of the radical social democratic student association , fought and won the election on his pledges to bring economic stability and development to germany and to increase domestic security and continuity in foreign affairs . a charismatic young leader , schröder was quick to associate himself with tony blair and us president bill clinton as one of the " new breed " of center-left leaders who were driving their countries away from conservative governments which had been led by the likes of kohl , ronald reagan and margaret thatcher .
it did n't take long for schröder to be seduced by the third way . in june 1999 , schröder and blair came together to write and publish the center-left manifesto " europe : the third way / die neue mitte . "
the leaders of great britain and germany were now working together to advocate a change to the traditional policy instruments in areas such as the concept of social justice , the role of the state , the balance between individualism and collectivism , and entrepreneurial spirit .

these days , there is a mind boggling array of outdoor sports and leisure activities on offer to average folks : mountainbiking , canyoning , rock climbing , nordic walking , hiking , windsurfing , kayaking , canoeing , sailing - the list just keeps getting longer .

stable sales outdoor products have become responsible for 31 percent of the overall sporting goods market , up from 27 percent in 2001 .
and while most german retail sectors saw decreased sales over the past year , revenues in the outdoor sector remained relatively stable , totaling 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.94 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
" our industry has seen a relatively stable level of sales - somewhere between negative 0.3 percent to zero percent sales growth , " said andreas bartmann , ceo of globetrotter , germany 's largest sporting goods and outdoor-equipment retailer .
" but other industries have had it much worse .
the textile industry was down a full 2 percent last year . "

despite overwhelming economic woes , the sector is surviving .
" of all those doing poorly , we 're doing best , " ott said with a laugh .
sales in the " basics " - soccer shoes and shirts for example - are still selling , he said .
" but for the time being , outdoors equipment brings in the most money . "

these companies sell low-cost food or coffee , but in addition they bring out a limited number of nonfood items each week .
the shopper who stays on top of the changing product lines can buy in-line skates , hiking boots , an all-weather jacket , pocket knife , tent or riding jodhpurs for a fraction of what they would cost in a sporting goods shop .
the pressure has meant that some smaller stores have been squeezed out of the sector altogether .
the secret of survival ?

at the cologne branch of the retail chain outdoor , which opened in 2004 , manager maurice goddar said sales have been booming .

back to first page back 2/2 right wing governments made a comeback slowly , however , the third way balloon deflated .
attitudes across europe changed in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states and subsequent elections in europe brought back conservative governments on the back of immigration and security issues .
soon blair and schröder would be members of a very exclusive club , the dwindling center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both schröder and blair managed to secure second terms , keeping the number of center-left governments in europe at five .
but both had fought their second elections with very different approaches to their first . blair was re-elected before sept .
11 in 2001 , but if he had waited until after the attacks , he may still have got in .
labor had drifted , or more correctly been steered further towards the right in its first four years in government under blair . blair moved further right on former tory support his reforms of the legal system - which some claimed cruelly curtailed civil liberties , the privatization of air traffic control , the encouragement of private investment in the public services , the imposition of commercial management on institutions such as the rail system and the competitive ethos on hospitals and schools could have been policies implemented by a conservative government .
indeed , while labor lost staunch support over such policies , blair continued to court the middle classes and picked up votes by attracting disillusioned voters who had abandoned the tories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany in 2002 , schröder narrowly avoided being booted out by adopting a hard line against the preparations for war in iraq and then still had to rely on a good showing by his green coalition partners to get the majority he needed to form a new government . while tony blair seemed to have found the right amount of blue to mix with his red , schröder was a mixture of colors and messages .
high unemployment and an ailing economy had forced him into considering an overhaul of the social welfare system - which went against his social democrat beliefs - while the growing storm of war had forced his hand in standing against the right-wing fervor of the ' coalition of the willing . ' second terms saw the third way floundering by their second terms , both blair and schröder were drifting further from their third way vision .
as a possible third term beckons for blair , and with schröder eyeing a third election in 2006 , do they still stand on the neue mitte four years down the line ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's support for the war in iraq , his siding with a republican president in the united states and increased curbs on civil liberties as part of justice reform all point to a stronger swing to the right since the last election . election 2005 sees blair blue and unabashed this time around , apparently liberated by his decision not to run again after these elections , blair is giving barely an inch on the more conservative parts of his agenda .
under his leadership , labor have abandoned public ownership and have made no secret of the desire to rely on competition and the private sector rather than state funding to supply public services , all things the 2005 election policies endorse . schröder , on the other hand , seems to be heading back to the left as a state election in the industrial heartland of north rhine westphalia looms on may 22 .
the spd seems to be scrambling to revive their left-wing credentials in a bid to avoid being booted out of one of the party 's traditional strongholds . schröder and comrades signal left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader müntefering has been added to marx , engels and lenin in this cartoon the spd have been seen to be riding to the defense of industry recently in response to this threat , with schröder and spd chairman franz müntefering advocating the outlawing of suggested " short-term " investment tactics - people " making quick money and moving on . " müntefering even prompted satirists to portray him as a friend of marx and lenin after a speech in april which all but officially dumped the neo-liberal ways of the neue mitte in favor of social responsibility .
more evidence of a return to more leftist ideals comes in the form of the spd 's sudden passion for a national minimum wage . with blair leading to the right and schröder leaning to the left , in terms of securing a third term for their parties , the third way looks like the path which will remain less trodden . nick amies , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair calls election on may 5 british prime minister tony blair , eager to lead his labor party to an unprecedented third straight term in power , ended weeks of speculation tuesday and called a general election for may 5 .

travel researcher aderhold explained said that in the past , a german retiree 's vacation consisted of sitting in his backyard .
today , " a 65 year old will do things that they would n't have done years ago , " he said .
" a hiking tour in south america or something , they 're doing activities that we used to associate with 30- or 40-year-olds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiking seniors and retirees who take such trips tend to be at an age where they can afford high quality clothing and equipment .
" they want the best textiles , nice bags , good shoes , " globetrotter 's bartmann said .
" and they want sales assistance . "
another booming sector is families , bartmann said .
even if most people do chose relaxation trips , many are opting for " adventurous " activities like canoe trips and camping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : camping family the sector has increased noticeably over the past five years , bartmann noted .
" you come into our store on a friday night and it is just full of families with children .
in the end it may still be a small segment of the market , but previously it did n't exist at all .
so it is very important for our sales . "
trying to make the most out of this development , outdoor companies increasingly aim their marketing campaigns at families .
one example is the cooperation jack wolfskin , germany 's largest outdoor goods manufacturer , started with mercedes benz in 2004 to offer an outdoor-sports competition for families .
and retailers such as globetrotter and the cologne-based blackfoot regularly offer classes and seminars aimed at families .
nostalgic trend also , the renewed interest in the great outdoors may be part of a general nostalgic trend sweeping through germany , according to travel researcher aderhold .
" younger people are n't rejecting the home market anymore , " he said .
" the alps , in germany as well as austria and switzerland , are back in fashion to some extent . "
finally - and possibly most importantly - the retailers note that what once counted as a specialist product now has a much larger use in the marketplace .
businessmen carry backpacks , kids wear gore-tex hiking boots to school , and housewives put on their ultra-light , breathable , all-weather jacket to go to the market .

" i am naturally very moved to be on the spot where the worst happened , " sharon told journalists accompanying him on his plane . survivors revisit torture chambers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of children in prisoners ' clothes stand behind barbed wire in the auschwitz concentration camp .
at auschwitz , thousands crowded into the camp , touring its gas chambers , torture cells , execution wall , the barracks into which the nazis crammed the first inmates . " i had to come here to see where my people were murdered , " an elderly woman from the southern us state of florida told afp , before breaking off abruptly , her voice wracked by sobs .
" now i see it and it 's horrible , " she said , apologizing for her tears . irene zattfild , of hungarian jewish extraction , was taking part in her fifth march of the living .
she was interned at auschwitz when she was 13 and lost her entire family here .
" i feel very , very lucky to have survived .
i 'm the only survivor in my family .
now i bring people here , " she said , her face almost permanently creased in a smile .
" i love life , and i want to pass that message on to others , " irene said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eldery man prays in auschwitz on thursday .
hungary only began mass deportations of jews late in the war , but once they began they were carried out with horrifying efficiency .
some 450,000 hungarian jews were killed at auschwitz , many sent directly to their deaths as soon as they arrived at the camp , packed like animals into cattle cars . " we did not reach out to the victims , we were not strong enough , " hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said at a private ceremony for his country 's victims .
" these atrocities were committed by no one other than us all , the human race , " he said . " this must not happen again " other marchers had come from australia , canada , france , greece , mexico , poland , south africa and beyond .
together , young and old , jewish and non-jewish , made their way under a grey sky and light drizzle out of auschwitz to birkenau to remember the victims of the holocaust . the festival atmosphere that had reigned before the shofar sounded was replaced by near silence , punctuated by thousands of footsteps on the dirt paths and cobbles leading out of auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants place candles on the rails at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living , an annual event to commemorate the atrocities of the holocaust , in 2002 .
" this is a reunion of a whole nation and those people who died here , " said eugenia spector , a 19-year-old ukrainian jew from odessa .
she said the laughter and song before the march was a way of letting off tension .
" some of the laughter and joking is just to relax .
when we went to the gas chamber , we had the feeling we were going to be gassed at any second .
after we visited the camp , we felt nervous and did n't know what to do , and we got rid of the tension by laughing , almost hysterically , " she said . jurek sternfeld , 66 , was in a group of 160 jewish people from around australia .
born in warsaw , six months before nazi germany invaded poland starting world war ii , the most deadly conflict in history , he was smuggled out of poland by his mother immediately after the start of the war .
his family spent the war in the soviet union , and survived the conflict intact - a rarity for polish jews . " i think this march is the right thing , as far as the future is concerned , to remember what happened .
as far as i 'm concerned this was the blackest point in the history of humankind .
a whole group of people was deliberately being wiped out .
this must not happen again and this is what motivates me to come here , " he said . the march of the living half an hour after the march had started , the crowd was still passing under the infamous arbeit macht frei gate at auschwitz and across the dirt paths of the camp onto the tarmacked road leading to birkenau , three kilometers -lrb- two miles -rrb- away . there , a memorial ceremony was to be held in the midst of the rubble of the purpose-built interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants holding israeli flags walk on the rails at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living .
a group of roman catholic school teachers from the united states was also among the marchers .
" the march is a chance for us to show that we remember and to be here on such a historical occasion - the 60th anniversary of the end of the war , " said toby harkleroad , a teacher from washington dc .
" we 'll take the message back to our students and everyone we meet in our lives , to make sure we never forget and it never happens again .
especially as catholics , we have to look back at the role we might have played in setting the world up for such a tragedy happening , what we did or did not do , " he said . wartime pope pius xvi did not denounce the nazi persecution of the jews . the nazis exterminated six million european jews , half of them from mainly catholic poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . the march of the living began in 1988 to counter voices denying that the holocaust ever took place . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de auschwitz march to recall holocaust victims thousands of people from some 50 countries have begun converging on southern poland to take part thursday in a march in memory of holocaust victims at auschwitz-birkenau , the most grimly efficient of nazi death camps .

" now i see it and it 's horrible , " she said , apologizing for her tears . irene zattfild , of hungarian jewish extraction , was taking part in her fifth march of the living .
she was interned at auschwitz when she was 13 and lost her entire family here .
" i feel very , very lucky to have survived .
i 'm the only survivor in my family .
now i bring people here , " she said , her face almost permanently creased in a smile .
" i love life , and i want to pass that message on to others , " irene said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eldery man prays in auschwitz on thursday .
hungary only began mass deportations of jews late in the war , but once they began they were carried out with horrifying efficiency .
some 450,000 hungarian jews were killed at auschwitz , many sent directly to their deaths as soon as they arrived at the camp , packed like animals into cattle cars . " we did not reach out to the victims , we were not strong enough , " hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said at a private ceremony for his country 's victims .
" these atrocities were committed by no one other than us all , the human race , " he said . " this must not happen again " other marchers had come from australia , canada , france , greece , mexico , poland , south africa and beyond .
together , young and old , jewish and non-jewish , made their way under a grey sky and light drizzle out of auschwitz to birkenau to remember the victims of the holocaust . the festival atmosphere that had reigned before the shofar sounded was replaced by near silence , punctuated by thousands of footsteps on the dirt paths and cobbles leading out of auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants place candles on the rails at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living , an annual event to commemorate the atrocities of the holocaust , in 2002 .
" this is a reunion of a whole nation and those people who died here , " said eugenia spector , a 19-year-old ukrainian jew from odessa .
she said the laughter and song before the march was a way of letting off tension .
" some of the laughter and joking is just to relax .
when we went to the gas chamber , we had the feeling we were going to be gassed at any second .
after we visited the camp , we felt nervous and did n't know what to do , and we got rid of the tension by laughing , almost hysterically , " she said . jurek sternfeld , 66 , was in a group of 160 jewish people from around australia .
born in warsaw , six months before nazi germany invaded poland starting world war ii , the most deadly conflict in history , he was smuggled out of poland by his mother immediately after the start of the war .
his family spent the war in the soviet union , and survived the conflict intact - a rarity for polish jews . " i think this march is the right thing , as far as the future is concerned , to remember what happened .
as far as i 'm concerned this was the blackest point in the history of humankind .
a whole group of people was deliberately being wiped out .
this must not happen again and this is what motivates me to come here , " he said . the march of the living half an hour after the march had started , the crowd was still passing under the infamous arbeit macht frei gate at auschwitz and across the dirt paths of the camp onto the tarmacked road leading to birkenau , three kilometers -lrb- two miles -rrb- away . there , a memorial ceremony was to be held in the midst of the rubble of the purpose-built interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants holding israeli flags walk on the rails at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living .
a group of roman catholic school teachers from the united states was also among the marchers .
" the march is a chance for us to show that we remember and to be here on such a historical occasion - the 60th anniversary of the end of the war , " said toby harkleroad , a teacher from washington dc .
" we 'll take the message back to our students and everyone we meet in our lives , to make sure we never forget and it never happens again .
especially as catholics , we have to look back at the role we might have played in setting the world up for such a tragedy happening , what we did or did not do , " he said . wartime pope pius xvi did not denounce the nazi persecution of the jews . the nazis exterminated six million european jews , half of them from mainly catholic poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . the march of the living began in 1988 to counter voices denying that the holocaust ever took place . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de auschwitz march to recall holocaust victims thousands of people from some 50 countries have begun converging on southern poland to take part thursday in a march in memory of holocaust victims at auschwitz-birkenau , the most grimly efficient of nazi death camps .

one in 14 germans is a hypochondriac , the study found , meaning that 7 percent of the nation 's population suffers from an irrational fear of illness . " those affected find that their thoughts are often concentrated on the body , " said gaby bleichhardt , one of the study 's authors .
" they 're constantly monitoring their bodily well-being . " the only relief from the never-ending cycle of fear are constant visits to the doctor .
but for five months now , psychologists in mainz have been offering a special treatment concept for hypochondriacs , designed to reduce the number of trips to the clinic . with the help of behavioral therapy , the patients learn to steer their thoughts in a different direction , away from the body and the terrible illnesses such as cancer , aids or alzheimer 's just waiting to invade it . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a passion for prescriptions as the last autumn leaves flutter to the ground dragging germany headlong into winter , patients across the country are preparing for their annual love affair with the doctors ' waiting room .

but with tony blair ’ s labour party set to win a third term on right-leaning policies , the question should be : " whatever happened to the third way ? " the 2005 british general election on thursday may seem to some voters as a step back in time .
just as it was in the 1997 election , in which tony blair first swept to office on the back of a euphoric landslide victory , the labor party is the unbeatable favorite while the opposition conservative party is in deep disarray . but it 's wrong to think that british politics has remained stuck in a time-warp since the late 1990s .
many things have changed , including the government that is running , and is likely to continue running , the country .
it may still be a labor government in name but much of the ideology associated with that name has been abandoned . to chart the change , one must start with that first landslide victory .
that heady summer of 1997 was filled with buzzwords cultivated by the bright young things on the left .
the labor party had been remade in blair 's image of new labor and socialism , a word and concept rendered unutterable by consecutive tory governments , had been replaced by the third way , a path between right and left which would allow market driven politics to be combined with social idealism . blairite masterminds had developed a strategy that would appeal to the traditional socialists and social democrats on the one hand and the advocates of thatcherite free-market conservatism on the other . courting middle england and the working class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third way promised the electorate a combination of conservative market orientation with the social idealism of the labor movement .
in place of arguments about the age-old ' tax and spend ' approach , the third way would deliver improved public services while lowering taxes .
while keeping the working classes sweet , blair was also courting middle england .
it worked beautifully . once in power , it was revealed that blair 's vision did n't end there .
at the end of the 1990s , 13 of the eu 's old 15 member states were run by center-left governments .
the british prime minister saw this as an opportunity to remake europe in the new labor image and with the continent wrapped up in the good feeling of sweeping decades of conservatism aside , blair set about spreading the third way .
he found willing participants in lionel jospin in france and giuliano amato in italy .
but few were more convinced at the time than newly elected german chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder joins wave of center-left optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democrats came into power in 1998 after 16 years in opposition to helmut kohl 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
schröder , a former chairman of the radical social democratic student association , fought and won the election on his pledges to bring economic stability and development to germany and to increase domestic security and continuity in foreign affairs . a charismatic young leader , schröder was quick to associate himself with tony blair and us president bill clinton as one of the " new breed " of center-left leaders who were driving their countries away from conservative governments which had been led by the likes of kohl , ronald reagan and margaret thatcher .
it did n't take long for schröder to be seduced by the third way . in june 1999 , schröder and blair came together to write and publish the center-left manifesto " europe : the third way / die neue mitte . "
the leaders of great britain and germany were now working together to advocate a change to the traditional policy instruments in areas such as the concept of social justice , the role of the state , the balance between individualism and collectivism , and entrepreneurial spirit .
it was an alternative model to the old labels of right and left and one that fitted the atmosphere of optimism which hung over europe as the new millennium dawned . please continue reading to find out about the third way 's demise 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair calls election on may 5 british prime minister tony blair , eager to lead his labor party to an unprecedented third straight term in power , ended weeks of speculation tuesday and called a general election for may 5 .

just as it was in the 1997 election , in which tony blair first swept to office on the back of a euphoric landslide victory , the labor party is the unbeatable favorite while the opposition conservative party is in deep disarray . but it 's wrong to think that british politics has remained stuck in a time-warp since the late 1990s .
many things have changed , including the government that is running , and is likely to continue running , the country .
it may still be a labor government in name but much of the ideology associated with that name has been abandoned . to chart the change , one must start with that first landslide victory .
that heady summer of 1997 was filled with buzzwords cultivated by the bright young things on the left .
the labor party had been remade in blair 's image of new labor and socialism , a word and concept rendered unutterable by consecutive tory governments , had been replaced by the third way , a path between right and left which would allow market driven politics to be combined with social idealism . blairite masterminds had developed a strategy that would appeal to the traditional socialists and social democrats on the one hand and the advocates of thatcherite free-market conservatism on the other . courting middle england and the working class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third way promised the electorate a combination of conservative market orientation with the social idealism of the labor movement .
in place of arguments about the age-old ' tax and spend ' approach , the third way would deliver improved public services while lowering taxes .
while keeping the working classes sweet , blair was also courting middle england .
it worked beautifully . once in power , it was revealed that blair 's vision did n't end there .
at the end of the 1990s , 13 of the eu 's old 15 member states were run by center-left governments .
the british prime minister saw this as an opportunity to remake europe in the new labor image and with the continent wrapped up in the good feeling of sweeping decades of conservatism aside , blair set about spreading the third way .
he found willing participants in lionel jospin in france and giuliano amato in italy .
but few were more convinced at the time than newly elected german chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder joins wave of center-left optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democrats came into power in 1998 after 16 years in opposition to helmut kohl 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
schröder , a former chairman of the radical social democratic student association , fought and won the election on his pledges to bring economic stability and development to germany and to increase domestic security and continuity in foreign affairs . a charismatic young leader , schröder was quick to associate himself with tony blair and us president bill clinton as one of the " new breed " of center-left leaders who were driving their countries away from conservative governments which had been led by the likes of kohl , ronald reagan and margaret thatcher .
it did n't take long for schröder to be seduced by the third way . in june 1999 , schröder and blair came together to write and publish the center-left manifesto " europe : the third way / die neue mitte . "
the leaders of great britain and germany were now working together to advocate a change to the traditional policy instruments in areas such as the concept of social justice , the role of the state , the balance between individualism and collectivism , and entrepreneurial spirit .
it was an alternative model to the old labels of right and left and one that fitted the atmosphere of optimism which hung over europe as the new millennium dawned . please continue reading to find out about the third way 's demise 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair calls election on may 5 british prime minister tony blair , eager to lead his labor party to an unprecedented third straight term in power , ended weeks of speculation tuesday and called a general election for may 5 .

back to first page back 2/2 right wing governments made a comeback slowly , however , the third way balloon deflated .
attitudes across europe changed in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states and subsequent elections in europe brought back conservative governments on the back of immigration and security issues .
soon blair and schröder would be members of a very exclusive club , the dwindling center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both schröder and blair managed to secure second terms , keeping the number of center-left governments in europe at five .
but both had fought their second elections with very different approaches to their first . blair was re-elected before sept .
11 in 2001 , but if he had waited until after the attacks , he may still have got in .
labor had drifted , or more correctly been steered further towards the right in its first four years in government under blair . blair moved further right on former tory support his reforms of the legal system - which some claimed cruelly curtailed civil liberties , the privatization of air traffic control , the encouragement of private investment in the public services , the imposition of commercial management on institutions such as the rail system and the competitive ethos on hospitals and schools could have been policies implemented by a conservative government .
indeed , while labor lost staunch support over such policies , blair continued to court the middle classes and picked up votes by attracting disillusioned voters who had abandoned the tories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany in 2002 , schröder narrowly avoided being booted out by adopting a hard line against the preparations for war in iraq and then still had to rely on a good showing by his green coalition partners to get the majority he needed to form a new government . while tony blair seemed to have found the right amount of blue to mix with his red , schröder was a mixture of colors and messages .
high unemployment and an ailing economy had forced him into considering an overhaul of the social welfare system - which went against his social democrat beliefs - while the growing storm of war had forced his hand in standing against the right-wing fervor of the ' coalition of the willing . ' second terms saw the third way floundering by their second terms , both blair and schröder were drifting further from their third way vision .
as a possible third term beckons for blair , and with schröder eyeing a third election in 2006 , do they still stand on the neue mitte four years down the line ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's support for the war in iraq , his siding with a republican president in the united states and increased curbs on civil liberties as part of justice reform all point to a stronger swing to the right since the last election . election 2005 sees blair blue and unabashed this time around , apparently liberated by his decision not to run again after these elections , blair is giving barely an inch on the more conservative parts of his agenda .
under his leadership , labor have abandoned public ownership and have made no secret of the desire to rely on competition and the private sector rather than state funding to supply public services , all things the 2005 election policies endorse . schröder , on the other hand , seems to be heading back to the left as a state election in the industrial heartland of north rhine westphalia looms on may 22 .
the spd seems to be scrambling to revive their left-wing credentials in a bid to avoid being booted out of one of the party 's traditional strongholds . schröder and comrades signal left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader müntefering has been added to marx , engels and lenin in this cartoon the spd have been seen to be riding to the defense of industry recently in response to this threat , with schröder and spd chairman franz müntefering advocating the outlawing of suggested " short-term " investment tactics - people " making quick money and moving on . " müntefering even prompted satirists to portray him as a friend of marx and lenin after a speech in april which all but officially dumped the neo-liberal ways of the neue mitte in favor of social responsibility .
more evidence of a return to more leftist ideals comes in the form of the spd 's sudden passion for a national minimum wage . with blair leading to the right and schröder leaning to the left , in terms of securing a third term for their parties , the third way looks like the path which will remain less trodden . nick amies , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair calls election on may 5 british prime minister tony blair , eager to lead his labor party to an unprecedented third straight term in power , ended weeks of speculation tuesday and called a general election for may 5 .

back to first page back 2/2 right wing governments made a comeback slowly , however , the third way balloon deflated .
attitudes across europe changed in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states and subsequent elections in europe brought back conservative governments on the back of immigration and security issues .
soon blair and schröder would be members of a very exclusive club , the dwindling center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both schröder and blair managed to secure second terms , keeping the number of center-left governments in europe at five .
but both had fought their second elections with very different approaches to their first . blair was re-elected before sept .
11 in 2001 , but if he had waited until after the attacks , he may still have got in .
labor had drifted , or more correctly been steered further towards the right in its first four years in government under blair . blair moved further right on former tory support his reforms of the legal system - which some claimed cruelly curtailed civil liberties , the privatization of air traffic control , the encouragement of private investment in the public services , the imposition of commercial management on institutions such as the rail system and the competitive ethos on hospitals and schools could have been policies implemented by a conservative government .
indeed , while labor lost staunch support over such policies , blair continued to court the middle classes and picked up votes by attracting disillusioned voters who had abandoned the tories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany in 2002 , schröder narrowly avoided being booted out by adopting a hard line against the preparations for war in iraq and then still had to rely on a good showing by his green coalition partners to get the majority he needed to form a new government . while tony blair seemed to have found the right amount of blue to mix with his red , schröder was a mixture of colors and messages .
high unemployment and an ailing economy had forced him into considering an overhaul of the social welfare system - which went against his social democrat beliefs - while the growing storm of war had forced his hand in standing against the right-wing fervor of the ' coalition of the willing . ' second terms saw the third way floundering by their second terms , both blair and schröder were drifting further from their third way vision .
as a possible third term beckons for blair , and with schröder eyeing a third election in 2006 , do they still stand on the neue mitte four years down the line ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's support for the war in iraq , his siding with a republican president in the united states and increased curbs on civil liberties as part of justice reform all point to a stronger swing to the right since the last election . election 2005 sees blair blue and unabashed this time around , apparently liberated by his decision not to run again after these elections , blair is giving barely an inch on the more conservative parts of his agenda .
under his leadership , labor have abandoned public ownership and have made no secret of the desire to rely on competition and the private sector rather than state funding to supply public services , all things the 2005 election policies endorse . schröder , on the other hand , seems to be heading back to the left as a state election in the industrial heartland of north rhine westphalia looms on may 22 .
the spd seems to be scrambling to revive their left-wing credentials in a bid to avoid being booted out of one of the party 's traditional strongholds . schröder and comrades signal left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader müntefering has been added to marx , engels and lenin in this cartoon the spd have been seen to be riding to the defense of industry recently in response to this threat , with schröder and spd chairman franz müntefering advocating the outlawing of suggested " short-term " investment tactics - people " making quick money and moving on . " müntefering even prompted satirists to portray him as a friend of marx and lenin after a speech in april which all but officially dumped the neo-liberal ways of the neue mitte in favor of social responsibility .
more evidence of a return to more leftist ideals comes in the form of the spd 's sudden passion for a national minimum wage . with blair leading to the right and schröder leaning to the left , in terms of securing a third term for their parties , the third way looks like the path which will remain less trodden . nick amies , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair calls election on may 5 british prime minister tony blair , eager to lead his labor party to an unprecedented third straight term in power , ended weeks of speculation tuesday and called a general election for may 5 .

back to first page back 2/2 right wing governments made a comeback slowly , however , the third way balloon deflated .
attitudes across europe changed in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states and subsequent elections in europe brought back conservative governments on the back of immigration and security issues .
soon blair and schröder would be members of a very exclusive club , the dwindling center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both schröder and blair managed to secure second terms , keeping the number of center-left governments in europe at five .
but both had fought their second elections with very different approaches to their first . blair was re-elected before sept .
11 in 2001 , but if he had waited until after the attacks , he may still have got in .
labor had drifted , or more correctly been steered further towards the right in its first four years in government under blair . blair moved further right on former tory support his reforms of the legal system - which some claimed cruelly curtailed civil liberties , the privatization of air traffic control , the encouragement of private investment in the public services , the imposition of commercial management on institutions such as the rail system and the competitive ethos on hospitals and schools could have been policies implemented by a conservative government .
indeed , while labor lost staunch support over such policies , blair continued to court the middle classes and picked up votes by attracting disillusioned voters who had abandoned the tories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany in 2002 , schröder narrowly avoided being booted out by adopting a hard line against the preparations for war in iraq and then still had to rely on a good showing by his green coalition partners to get the majority he needed to form a new government . while tony blair seemed to have found the right amount of blue to mix with his red , schröder was a mixture of colors and messages .
high unemployment and an ailing economy had forced him into considering an overhaul of the social welfare system - which went against his social democrat beliefs - while the growing storm of war had forced his hand in standing against the right-wing fervor of the ' coalition of the willing . ' second terms saw the third way floundering by their second terms , both blair and schröder were drifting further from their third way vision .
as a possible third term beckons for blair , and with schröder eyeing a third election in 2006 , do they still stand on the neue mitte four years down the line ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's support for the war in iraq , his siding with a republican president in the united states and increased curbs on civil liberties as part of justice reform all point to a stronger swing to the right since the last election . election 2005 sees blair blue and unabashed this time around , apparently liberated by his decision not to run again after these elections , blair is giving barely an inch on the more conservative parts of his agenda .
under his leadership , labor have abandoned public ownership and have made no secret of the desire to rely on competition and the private sector rather than state funding to supply public services , all things the 2005 election policies endorse . schröder , on the other hand , seems to be heading back to the left as a state election in the industrial heartland of north rhine westphalia looms on may 22 .
the spd seems to be scrambling to revive their left-wing credentials in a bid to avoid being booted out of one of the party 's traditional strongholds . schröder and comrades signal left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader müntefering has been added to marx , engels and lenin in this cartoon the spd have been seen to be riding to the defense of industry recently in response to this threat , with schröder and spd chairman franz müntefering advocating the outlawing of suggested " short-term " investment tactics - people " making quick money and moving on . " müntefering even prompted satirists to portray him as a friend of marx and lenin after a speech in april which all but officially dumped the neo-liberal ways of the neue mitte in favor of social responsibility .
more evidence of a return to more leftist ideals comes in the form of the spd 's sudden passion for a national minimum wage . with blair leading to the right and schröder leaning to the left , in terms of securing a third term for their parties , the third way looks like the path which will remain less trodden . nick amies , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair calls election on may 5 british prime minister tony blair , eager to lead his labor party to an unprecedented third straight term in power , ended weeks of speculation tuesday and called a general election for may 5 .

but with tony blair ’ s labour party set to win a third term on right-leaning policies , the question should be : " whatever happened to the third way ? " the 2005 british general election on thursday may seem to some voters as a step back in time .
just as it was in the 1997 election , in which tony blair first swept to office on the back of a euphoric landslide victory , the labor party is the unbeatable favorite while the opposition conservative party is in deep disarray . but it 's wrong to think that british politics has remained stuck in a time-warp since the late 1990s .
many things have changed , including the government that is running , and is likely to continue running , the country .
it may still be a labor government in name but much of the ideology associated with that name has been abandoned . to chart the change , one must start with that first landslide victory .
that heady summer of 1997 was filled with buzzwords cultivated by the bright young things on the left .
the labor party had been remade in blair 's image of new labor and socialism , a word and concept rendered unutterable by consecutive tory governments , had been replaced by the third way , a path between right and left which would allow market driven politics to be combined with social idealism . blairite masterminds had developed a strategy that would appeal to the traditional socialists and social democrats on the one hand and the advocates of thatcherite free-market conservatism on the other . courting middle england and the working class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third way promised the electorate a combination of conservative market orientation with the social idealism of the labor movement .
in place of arguments about the age-old ' tax and spend ' approach , the third way would deliver improved public services while lowering taxes .
while keeping the working classes sweet , blair was also courting middle england .
it worked beautifully . once in power , it was revealed that blair 's vision did n't end there .
at the end of the 1990s , 13 of the eu 's old 15 member states were run by center-left governments .
the british prime minister saw this as an opportunity to remake europe in the new labor image and with the continent wrapped up in the good feeling of sweeping decades of conservatism aside , blair set about spreading the third way .
he found willing participants in lionel jospin in france and giuliano amato in italy .
but few were more convinced at the time than newly elected german chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder joins wave of center-left optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democrats came into power in 1998 after 16 years in opposition to helmut kohl 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
schröder , a former chairman of the radical social democratic student association , fought and won the election on his pledges to bring economic stability and development to germany and to increase domestic security and continuity in foreign affairs . a charismatic young leader , schröder was quick to associate himself with tony blair and us president bill clinton as one of the " new breed " of center-left leaders who were driving their countries away from conservative governments which had been led by the likes of kohl , ronald reagan and margaret thatcher .
it did n't take long for schröder to be seduced by the third way . in june 1999 , schröder and blair came together to write and publish the center-left manifesto " europe : the third way / die neue mitte . "
the leaders of great britain and germany were now working together to advocate a change to the traditional policy instruments in areas such as the concept of social justice , the role of the state , the balance between individualism and collectivism , and entrepreneurial spirit .

back to first page back 2/2 right wing governments made a comeback slowly , however , the third way balloon deflated .
attitudes across europe changed in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states and subsequent elections in europe brought back conservative governments on the back of immigration and security issues .
soon blair and schröder would be members of a very exclusive club , the dwindling center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both schröder and blair managed to secure second terms , keeping the number of center-left governments in europe at five .
but both had fought their second elections with very different approaches to their first . blair was re-elected before sept .
11 in 2001 , but if he had waited until after the attacks , he may still have got in .
labor had drifted , or more correctly been steered further towards the right in its first four years in government under blair . blair moved further right on former tory support his reforms of the legal system - which some claimed cruelly curtailed civil liberties , the privatization of air traffic control , the encouragement of private investment in the public services , the imposition of commercial management on institutions such as the rail system and the competitive ethos on hospitals and schools could have been policies implemented by a conservative government .
indeed , while labor lost staunch support over such policies , blair continued to court the middle classes and picked up votes by attracting disillusioned voters who had abandoned the tories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany in 2002 , schröder narrowly avoided being booted out by adopting a hard line against the preparations for war in iraq and then still had to rely on a good showing by his green coalition partners to get the majority he needed to form a new government . while tony blair seemed to have found the right amount of blue to mix with his red , schröder was a mixture of colors and messages .
high unemployment and an ailing economy had forced him into considering an overhaul of the social welfare system - which went against his social democrat beliefs - while the growing storm of war had forced his hand in standing against the right-wing fervor of the ' coalition of the willing . ' second terms saw the third way floundering by their second terms , both blair and schröder were drifting further from their third way vision .
as a possible third term beckons for blair , and with schröder eyeing a third election in 2006 , do they still stand on the neue mitte four years down the line ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's support for the war in iraq , his siding with a republican president in the united states and increased curbs on civil liberties as part of justice reform all point to a stronger swing to the right since the last election . election 2005 sees blair blue and unabashed this time around , apparently liberated by his decision not to run again after these elections , blair is giving barely an inch on the more conservative parts of his agenda .
under his leadership , labor have abandoned public ownership and have made no secret of the desire to rely on competition and the private sector rather than state funding to supply public services , all things the 2005 election policies endorse . schröder , on the other hand , seems to be heading back to the left as a state election in the industrial heartland of north rhine westphalia looms on may 22 .
the spd seems to be scrambling to revive their left-wing credentials in a bid to avoid being booted out of one of the party 's traditional strongholds . schröder and comrades signal left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader müntefering has been added to marx , engels and lenin in this cartoon the spd have been seen to be riding to the defense of industry recently in response to this threat , with schröder and spd chairman franz müntefering advocating the outlawing of suggested " short-term " investment tactics - people " making quick money and moving on . " müntefering even prompted satirists to portray him as a friend of marx and lenin after a speech in april which all but officially dumped the neo-liberal ways of the neue mitte in favor of social responsibility .
more evidence of a return to more leftist ideals comes in the form of the spd 's sudden passion for a national minimum wage . with blair leading to the right and schröder leaning to the left , in terms of securing a third term for their parties , the third way looks like the path which will remain less trodden . nick amies , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair calls election on may 5 british prime minister tony blair , eager to lead his labor party to an unprecedented third straight term in power , ended weeks of speculation tuesday and called a general election for may 5 .

but with tony blair ’ s labour party set to win a third term on right-leaning policies , the question should be : " whatever happened to the third way ? " the 2005 british general election on thursday may seem to some voters as a step back in time .
just as it was in the 1997 election , in which tony blair first swept to office on the back of a euphoric landslide victory , the labor party is the unbeatable favorite while the opposition conservative party is in deep disarray . but it 's wrong to think that british politics has remained stuck in a time-warp since the late 1990s .
many things have changed , including the government that is running , and is likely to continue running , the country .
it may still be a labor government in name but much of the ideology associated with that name has been abandoned . to chart the change , one must start with that first landslide victory .
that heady summer of 1997 was filled with buzzwords cultivated by the bright young things on the left .
the labor party had been remade in blair 's image of new labor and socialism , a word and concept rendered unutterable by consecutive tory governments , had been replaced by the third way , a path between right and left which would allow market driven politics to be combined with social idealism . blairite masterminds had developed a strategy that would appeal to the traditional socialists and social democrats on the one hand and the advocates of thatcherite free-market conservatism on the other . courting middle england and the working class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third way promised the electorate a combination of conservative market orientation with the social idealism of the labor movement .

these days , there is a mind boggling array of outdoor sports and leisure activities on offer to average folks : mountainbiking , canyoning , rock climbing , nordic walking , hiking , windsurfing , kayaking , canoeing , sailing - the list just keeps getting longer .
and the market share of outdoor products -lrb- a subset of the sporting goods industry , -rrb- keeps growing right along with it .
stable sales outdoor products have become responsible for 31 percent of the overall sporting goods market , up from 27 percent in 2001 .
and while most german retail sectors saw decreased sales over the past year , revenues in the outdoor sector remained relatively stable , totaling 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.94 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
" our industry has seen a relatively stable level of sales - somewhere between negative 0.3 percent to zero percent sales growth , " said andreas bartmann , ceo of globetrotter , germany 's largest sporting goods and outdoor-equipment retailer .
" but other industries have had it much worse .
the textile industry was down a full 2 percent last year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walkers in munich in general , germans are an outdoorsy lot .
on ascension day this thursday , a national holiday in germany , millions will head outside .
the sunday afternoon hike is a time-honored family tradition , and sports clubs are a widely used social outlet .
this is reflected in the overall sales of sporting goods , said helmut ott , who heads up the alliance of german sporting goods dealers .
despite overwhelming economic woes , the sector is surviving .
" of all those doing poorly , we 're doing best , " ott said with a laugh .
sales in the " basics " - soccer shoes and shirts for example - are still selling , he said .

but with tony blair ’ s labour party set to win a third term on right-leaning policies , the question should be : " whatever happened to the third way ? " the 2005 british general election on thursday may seem to some voters as a step back in time .
just as it was in the 1997 election , in which tony blair first swept to office on the back of a euphoric landslide victory , the labor party is the unbeatable favorite while the opposition conservative party is in deep disarray . but it 's wrong to think that british politics has remained stuck in a time-warp since the late 1990s .
many things have changed , including the government that is running , and is likely to continue running , the country .
it may still be a labor government in name but much of the ideology associated with that name has been abandoned . to chart the change , one must start with that first landslide victory .
that heady summer of 1997 was filled with buzzwords cultivated by the bright young things on the left .
the labor party had been remade in blair 's image of new labor and socialism , a word and concept rendered unutterable by consecutive tory governments , had been replaced by the third way , a path between right and left which would allow market driven politics to be combined with social idealism . blairite masterminds had developed a strategy that would appeal to the traditional socialists and social democrats on the one hand and the advocates of thatcherite free-market conservatism on the other . courting middle england and the working class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third way promised the electorate a combination of conservative market orientation with the social idealism of the labor movement .

at the end of the 1990s , 13 of the eu 's old 15 member states were run by center-left governments .
the british prime minister saw this as an opportunity to remake europe in the new labor image and with the continent wrapped up in the good feeling of sweeping decades of conservatism aside , blair set about spreading the third way .

schröder , a former chairman of the radical social democratic student association , fought and won the election on his pledges to bring economic stability and development to germany and to increase domestic security and continuity in foreign affairs . a charismatic young leader , schröder was quick to associate himself with tony blair and us president bill clinton as one of the " new breed " of center-left leaders who were driving their countries away from conservative governments which had been led by the likes of kohl , ronald reagan and margaret thatcher .

back to first page back 2/2 right wing governments made a comeback slowly , however , the third way balloon deflated .
attitudes across europe changed in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states and subsequent elections in europe brought back conservative governments on the back of immigration and security issues .
soon blair and schröder would be members of a very exclusive club , the dwindling center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both schröder and blair managed to secure second terms , keeping the number of center-left governments in europe at five .
but both had fought their second elections with very different approaches to their first . blair was re-elected before sept .
11 in 2001 , but if he had waited until after the attacks , he may still have got in .
labor had drifted , or more correctly been steered further towards the right in its first four years in government under blair . blair moved further right on former tory support his reforms of the legal system - which some claimed cruelly curtailed civil liberties , the privatization of air traffic control , the encouragement of private investment in the public services , the imposition of commercial management on institutions such as the rail system and the competitive ethos on hospitals and schools could have been policies implemented by a conservative government .
indeed , while labor lost staunch support over such policies , blair continued to court the middle classes and picked up votes by attracting disillusioned voters who had abandoned the tories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany in 2002 , schröder narrowly avoided being booted out by adopting a hard line against the preparations for war in iraq and then still had to rely on a good showing by his green coalition partners to get the majority he needed to form a new government . while tony blair seemed to have found the right amount of blue to mix with his red , schröder was a mixture of colors and messages .
high unemployment and an ailing economy had forced him into considering an overhaul of the social welfare system - which went against his social democrat beliefs - while the growing storm of war had forced his hand in standing against the right-wing fervor of the ' coalition of the willing . ' second terms saw the third way floundering by their second terms , both blair and schröder were drifting further from their third way vision .
as a possible third term beckons for blair , and with schröder eyeing a third election in 2006 , do they still stand on the neue mitte four years down the line ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's support for the war in iraq , his siding with a republican president in the united states and increased curbs on civil liberties as part of justice reform all point to a stronger swing to the right since the last election . election 2005 sees blair blue and unabashed this time around , apparently liberated by his decision not to run again after these elections , blair is giving barely an inch on the more conservative parts of his agenda .

she said the laughter and song before the march was a way of letting off tension .
" some of the laughter and joking is just to relax .

after we visited the camp , we felt nervous and did n't know what to do , and we got rid of the tension by laughing , almost hysterically , " she said . jurek sternfeld , 66 , was in a group of 160 jewish people from around australia .
born in warsaw , six months before nazi germany invaded poland starting world war ii , the most deadly conflict in history , he was smuggled out of poland by his mother immediately after the start of the war .
his family spent the war in the soviet union , and survived the conflict intact - a rarity for polish jews . " i think this march is the right thing , as far as the future is concerned , to remember what happened .
as far as i 'm concerned this was the blackest point in the history of humankind .
a whole group of people was deliberately being wiped out .
this must not happen again and this is what motivates me to come here , " he said . the march of the living half an hour after the march had started , the crowd was still passing under the infamous arbeit macht frei gate at auschwitz and across the dirt paths of the camp onto the tarmacked road leading to birkenau , three kilometers -lrb- two miles -rrb- away . there , a memorial ceremony was to be held in the midst of the rubble of the purpose-built interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants holding israeli flags walk on the rails at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living .

travel researcher aderhold explained said that in the past , a german retiree 's vacation consisted of sitting in his backyard .
today , " a 65 year old will do things that they would n't have done years ago , " he said .
" a hiking tour in south america or something , they 're doing activities that we used to associate with 30- or 40-year-olds . "

these days , there is a mind boggling array of outdoor sports and leisure activities on offer to average folks : mountainbiking , canyoning , rock climbing , nordic walking , hiking , windsurfing , kayaking , canoeing , sailing - the list just keeps getting longer .
and the market share of outdoor products -lrb- a subset of the sporting goods industry , -rrb- keeps growing right along with it .
stable sales outdoor products have become responsible for 31 percent of the overall sporting goods market , up from 27 percent in 2001 .
and while most german retail sectors saw decreased sales over the past year , revenues in the outdoor sector remained relatively stable , totaling 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.94 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
" our industry has seen a relatively stable level of sales - somewhere between negative 0.3 percent to zero percent sales growth , " said andreas bartmann , ceo of globetrotter , germany 's largest sporting goods and outdoor-equipment retailer .

on ascension day this thursday , a national holiday in germany , millions will head outside .
the sunday afternoon hike is a time-honored family tradition , and sports clubs are a widely used social outlet .
this is reflected in the overall sales of sporting goods , said helmut ott , who heads up the alliance of german sporting goods dealers .
despite overwhelming economic woes , the sector is surviving .
" of all those doing poorly , we 're doing best , " ott said with a laugh .
sales in the " basics " - soccer shoes and shirts for example - are still selling , he said .
" but for the time being , outdoors equipment brings in the most money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchibo branch office in dortmund he noted that the industry is feeling a lot of pressure from massive discount chains like aldi , lidl and tchibo .
these companies sell low-cost food or coffee , but in addition they bring out a limited number of nonfood items each week .
the shopper who stays on top of the changing product lines can buy in-line skates , hiking boots , an all-weather jacket , pocket knife , tent or riding jodhpurs for a fraction of what they would cost in a sporting goods shop .
the pressure has meant that some smaller stores have been squeezed out of the sector altogether .
the secret of survival ?
do n't try to compete with discounters by lowering prices and slashing staff , said globetrotter 's bartmann .
" the stores that succeed have a different concept , " he said .
" they 've made going into the store an emotional experience , one that gives you the feeling of the outdoors . "

at the cologne branch of the retail chain outdoor , which opened in 2004 , manager maurice goddar said sales have been booming .

back to first page back 2/2 right wing governments made a comeback slowly , however , the third way balloon deflated .
attitudes across europe changed in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states and subsequent elections in europe brought back conservative governments on the back of immigration and security issues .
soon blair and schröder would be members of a very exclusive club , the dwindling center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both schröder and blair managed to secure second terms , keeping the number of center-left governments in europe at five .
but both had fought their second elections with very different approaches to their first . blair was re-elected before sept .
11 in 2001 , but if he had waited until after the attacks , he may still have got in .
labor had drifted , or more correctly been steered further towards the right in its first four years in government under blair . blair moved further right on former tory support his reforms of the legal system - which some claimed cruelly curtailed civil liberties , the privatization of air traffic control , the encouragement of private investment in the public services , the imposition of commercial management on institutions such as the rail system and the competitive ethos on hospitals and schools could have been policies implemented by a conservative government .
indeed , while labor lost staunch support over such policies , blair continued to court the middle classes and picked up votes by attracting disillusioned voters who had abandoned the tories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany in 2002 , schröder narrowly avoided being booted out by adopting a hard line against the preparations for war in iraq and then still had to rely on a good showing by his green coalition partners to get the majority he needed to form a new government . while tony blair seemed to have found the right amount of blue to mix with his red , schröder was a mixture of colors and messages .
high unemployment and an ailing economy had forced him into considering an overhaul of the social welfare system - which went against his social democrat beliefs - while the growing storm of war had forced his hand in standing against the right-wing fervor of the ' coalition of the willing . ' second terms saw the third way floundering by their second terms , both blair and schröder were drifting further from their third way vision .
as a possible third term beckons for blair , and with schröder eyeing a third election in 2006 , do they still stand on the neue mitte four years down the line ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's support for the war in iraq , his siding with a republican president in the united states and increased curbs on civil liberties as part of justice reform all point to a stronger swing to the right since the last election . election 2005 sees blair blue and unabashed this time around , apparently liberated by his decision not to run again after these elections , blair is giving barely an inch on the more conservative parts of his agenda .
under his leadership , labor have abandoned public ownership and have made no secret of the desire to rely on competition and the private sector rather than state funding to supply public services , all things the 2005 election policies endorse . schröder , on the other hand , seems to be heading back to the left as a state election in the industrial heartland of north rhine westphalia looms on may 22 .
the spd seems to be scrambling to revive their left-wing credentials in a bid to avoid being booted out of one of the party 's traditional strongholds . schröder and comrades signal left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader müntefering has been added to marx , engels and lenin in this cartoon the spd have been seen to be riding to the defense of industry recently in response to this threat , with schröder and spd chairman franz müntefering advocating the outlawing of suggested " short-term " investment tactics - people " making quick money and moving on . " müntefering even prompted satirists to portray him as a friend of marx and lenin after a speech in april which all but officially dumped the neo-liberal ways of the neue mitte in favor of social responsibility .
more evidence of a return to more leftist ideals comes in the form of the spd 's sudden passion for a national minimum wage . with blair leading to the right and schröder leaning to the left , in terms of securing a third term for their parties , the third way looks like the path which will remain less trodden . nick amies , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair calls election on may 5 british prime minister tony blair , eager to lead his labor party to an unprecedented third straight term in power , ended weeks of speculation tuesday and called a general election for may 5 .
-lrb- april 5 , 2005 -rrb- capitalism debate raises eyebrows when the head of the ruling social democrats hit out at the capitalism of the business community , he struck a chord with his party 's traditional base .
but many are suspicious of his motives ahead of crucial state polls .
-lrb- april 27 , 2005 -rrb- leaders try to breathe fresh life into the third way gerhard schröder and tony blair are among center-left leaders plotting a new course for social democracy at a conference on progressive governance .
but have they got lost on their journey along the " third way ? "

" i am naturally very moved to be on the spot where the worst happened , " sharon told journalists accompanying him on his plane . survivors revisit torture chambers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of children in prisoners ' clothes stand behind barbed wire in the auschwitz concentration camp .
at auschwitz , thousands crowded into the camp , touring its gas chambers , torture cells , execution wall , the barracks into which the nazis crammed the first inmates . " i had to come here to see where my people were murdered , " an elderly woman from the southern us state of florida told afp , before breaking off abruptly , her voice wracked by sobs .
" now i see it and it 's horrible , " she said , apologizing for her tears . irene zattfild , of hungarian jewish extraction , was taking part in her fifth march of the living .
she was interned at auschwitz when she was 13 and lost her entire family here .
" i feel very , very lucky to have survived .
i 'm the only survivor in my family .
now i bring people here , " she said , her face almost permanently creased in a smile .
" i love life , and i want to pass that message on to others , " irene said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eldery man prays in auschwitz on thursday .
hungary only began mass deportations of jews late in the war , but once they began they were carried out with horrifying efficiency .
some 450,000 hungarian jews were killed at auschwitz , many sent directly to their deaths as soon as they arrived at the camp , packed like animals into cattle cars . " we did not reach out to the victims , we were not strong enough , " hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said at a private ceremony for his country 's victims .
" these atrocities were committed by no one other than us all , the human race , " he said . " this must not happen again " other marchers had come from australia , canada , france , greece , mexico , poland , south africa and beyond .
together , young and old , jewish and non-jewish , made their way under a grey sky and light drizzle out of auschwitz to birkenau to remember the victims of the holocaust . the festival atmosphere that had reigned before the shofar sounded was replaced by near silence , punctuated by thousands of footsteps on the dirt paths and cobbles leading out of auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants place candles on the rails at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living , an annual event to commemorate the atrocities of the holocaust , in 2002 .
" this is a reunion of a whole nation and those people who died here , " said eugenia spector , a 19-year-old ukrainian jew from odessa .
she said the laughter and song before the march was a way of letting off tension .
" some of the laughter and joking is just to relax .
when we went to the gas chamber , we had the feeling we were going to be gassed at any second .
after we visited the camp , we felt nervous and did n't know what to do , and we got rid of the tension by laughing , almost hysterically , " she said . jurek sternfeld , 66 , was in a group of 160 jewish people from around australia .
born in warsaw , six months before nazi germany invaded poland starting world war ii , the most deadly conflict in history , he was smuggled out of poland by his mother immediately after the start of the war .
his family spent the war in the soviet union , and survived the conflict intact - a rarity for polish jews . " i think this march is the right thing , as far as the future is concerned , to remember what happened .
as far as i 'm concerned this was the blackest point in the history of humankind .
a whole group of people was deliberately being wiped out .
this must not happen again and this is what motivates me to come here , " he said . the march of the living half an hour after the march had started , the crowd was still passing under the infamous arbeit macht frei gate at auschwitz and across the dirt paths of the camp onto the tarmacked road leading to birkenau , three kilometers -lrb- two miles -rrb- away . there , a memorial ceremony was to be held in the midst of the rubble of the purpose-built interconnecting gas chambers and crematoria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young israeli participants holding israeli flags walk on the rails at the nazi auschwitz-birkenau death camp during the march of the living .
a group of roman catholic school teachers from the united states was also among the marchers .
" the march is a chance for us to show that we remember and to be here on such a historical occasion - the 60th anniversary of the end of the war , " said toby harkleroad , a teacher from washington dc .
" we 'll take the message back to our students and everyone we meet in our lives , to make sure we never forget and it never happens again .
especially as catholics , we have to look back at the role we might have played in setting the world up for such a tragedy happening , what we did or did not do , " he said . wartime pope pius xvi did not denounce the nazi persecution of the jews . the nazis exterminated six million european jews , half of them from mainly catholic poland , home to europe 's largest jewish community before world war ii . the march of the living began in 1988 to counter voices denying that the holocaust ever took place . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de auschwitz march to recall holocaust victims thousands of people from some 50 countries have begun converging on southern poland to take part thursday in a march in memory of holocaust victims at auschwitz-birkenau , the most grimly efficient of nazi death camps .

back to first page back 2/2 right wing governments made a comeback slowly , however , the third way balloon deflated .
attitudes across europe changed in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states and subsequent elections in europe brought back conservative governments on the back of immigration and security issues .
soon blair and schröder would be members of a very exclusive club , the dwindling center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both schröder and blair managed to secure second terms , keeping the number of center-left governments in europe at five .
but both had fought their second elections with very different approaches to their first . blair was re-elected before sept .
11 in 2001 , but if he had waited until after the attacks , he may still have got in .
labor had drifted , or more correctly been steered further towards the right in its first four years in government under blair . blair moved further right on former tory support his reforms of the legal system - which some claimed cruelly curtailed civil liberties , the privatization of air traffic control , the encouragement of private investment in the public services , the imposition of commercial management on institutions such as the rail system and the competitive ethos on hospitals and schools could have been policies implemented by a conservative government .
indeed , while labor lost staunch support over such policies , blair continued to court the middle classes and picked up votes by attracting disillusioned voters who had abandoned the tories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany in 2002 , schröder narrowly avoided being booted out by adopting a hard line against the preparations for war in iraq and then still had to rely on a good showing by his green coalition partners to get the majority he needed to form a new government . while tony blair seemed to have found the right amount of blue to mix with his red , schröder was a mixture of colors and messages .
high unemployment and an ailing economy had forced him into considering an overhaul of the social welfare system - which went against his social democrat beliefs - while the growing storm of war had forced his hand in standing against the right-wing fervor of the ' coalition of the willing . ' second terms saw the third way floundering by their second terms , both blair and schröder were drifting further from their third way vision .
as a possible third term beckons for blair , and with schröder eyeing a third election in 2006 , do they still stand on the neue mitte four years down the line ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's support for the war in iraq , his siding with a republican president in the united states and increased curbs on civil liberties as part of justice reform all point to a stronger swing to the right since the last election . election 2005 sees blair blue and unabashed this time around , apparently liberated by his decision not to run again after these elections , blair is giving barely an inch on the more conservative parts of his agenda .
under his leadership , labor have abandoned public ownership and have made no secret of the desire to rely on competition and the private sector rather than state funding to supply public services , all things the 2005 election policies endorse . schröder , on the other hand , seems to be heading back to the left as a state election in the industrial heartland of north rhine westphalia looms on may 22 .
the spd seems to be scrambling to revive their left-wing credentials in a bid to avoid being booted out of one of the party 's traditional strongholds . schröder and comrades signal left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader müntefering has been added to marx , engels and lenin in this cartoon the spd have been seen to be riding to the defense of industry recently in response to this threat , with schröder and spd chairman franz müntefering advocating the outlawing of suggested " short-term " investment tactics - people " making quick money and moving on . " müntefering even prompted satirists to portray him as a friend of marx and lenin after a speech in april which all but officially dumped the neo-liberal ways of the neue mitte in favor of social responsibility .
more evidence of a return to more leftist ideals comes in the form of the spd 's sudden passion for a national minimum wage . with blair leading to the right and schröder leaning to the left , in terms of securing a third term for their parties , the third way looks like the path which will remain less trodden . nick amies , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair calls election on may 5 british prime minister tony blair , eager to lead his labor party to an unprecedented third straight term in power , ended weeks of speculation tuesday and called a general election for may 5 .

back to first page back 2/2 right wing governments made a comeback slowly , however , the third way balloon deflated .
attitudes across europe changed in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states and subsequent elections in europe brought back conservative governments on the back of immigration and security issues .
soon blair and schröder would be members of a very exclusive club , the dwindling center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both schröder and blair managed to secure second terms , keeping the number of center-left governments in europe at five .
but both had fought their second elections with very different approaches to their first . blair was re-elected before sept .
11 in 2001 , but if he had waited until after the attacks , he may still have got in .
labor had drifted , or more correctly been steered further towards the right in its first four years in government under blair . blair moved further right on former tory support his reforms of the legal system - which some claimed cruelly curtailed civil liberties , the privatization of air traffic control , the encouragement of private investment in the public services , the imposition of commercial management on institutions such as the rail system and the competitive ethos on hospitals and schools could have been policies implemented by a conservative government .
indeed , while labor lost staunch support over such policies , blair continued to court the middle classes and picked up votes by attracting disillusioned voters who had abandoned the tories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany in 2002 , schröder narrowly avoided being booted out by adopting a hard line against the preparations for war in iraq and then still had to rely on a good showing by his green coalition partners to get the majority he needed to form a new government . while tony blair seemed to have found the right amount of blue to mix with his red , schröder was a mixture of colors and messages .
high unemployment and an ailing economy had forced him into considering an overhaul of the social welfare system - which went against his social democrat beliefs - while the growing storm of war had forced his hand in standing against the right-wing fervor of the ' coalition of the willing . ' second terms saw the third way floundering by their second terms , both blair and schröder were drifting further from their third way vision .
as a possible third term beckons for blair , and with schröder eyeing a third election in 2006 , do they still stand on the neue mitte four years down the line ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's support for the war in iraq , his siding with a republican president in the united states and increased curbs on civil liberties as part of justice reform all point to a stronger swing to the right since the last election . election 2005 sees blair blue and unabashed this time around , apparently liberated by his decision not to run again after these elections , blair is giving barely an inch on the more conservative parts of his agenda .
under his leadership , labor have abandoned public ownership and have made no secret of the desire to rely on competition and the private sector rather than state funding to supply public services , all things the 2005 election policies endorse . schröder , on the other hand , seems to be heading back to the left as a state election in the industrial heartland of north rhine westphalia looms on may 22 .
the spd seems to be scrambling to revive their left-wing credentials in a bid to avoid being booted out of one of the party 's traditional strongholds . schröder and comrades signal left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader müntefering has been added to marx , engels and lenin in this cartoon the spd have been seen to be riding to the defense of industry recently in response to this threat , with schröder and spd chairman franz müntefering advocating the outlawing of suggested " short-term " investment tactics - people " making quick money and moving on . " müntefering even prompted satirists to portray him as a friend of marx and lenin after a speech in april which all but officially dumped the neo-liberal ways of the neue mitte in favor of social responsibility .
more evidence of a return to more leftist ideals comes in the form of the spd 's sudden passion for a national minimum wage . with blair leading to the right and schröder leaning to the left , in terms of securing a third term for their parties , the third way looks like the path which will remain less trodden . nick amies , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair calls election on may 5 british prime minister tony blair , eager to lead his labor party to an unprecedented third straight term in power , ended weeks of speculation tuesday and called a general election for may 5 .

travel researcher aderhold explained said that in the past , a german retiree 's vacation consisted of sitting in his backyard .
today , " a 65 year old will do things that they would n't have done years ago , " he said .
" a hiking tour in south america or something , they 're doing activities that we used to associate with 30- or 40-year-olds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiking seniors and retirees who take such trips tend to be at an age where they can afford high quality clothing and equipment .
" they want the best textiles , nice bags , good shoes , " globetrotter 's bartmann said .
" and they want sales assistance . "
another booming sector is families , bartmann said .
even if most people do chose relaxation trips , many are opting for " adventurous " activities like canoe trips and camping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : camping family the sector has increased noticeably over the past five years , bartmann noted .
" you come into our store on a friday night and it is just full of families with children .
in the end it may still be a small segment of the market , but previously it did n't exist at all .
so it is very important for our sales . "
trying to make the most out of this development , outdoor companies increasingly aim their marketing campaigns at families .
one example is the cooperation jack wolfskin , germany 's largest outdoor goods manufacturer , started with mercedes benz in 2004 to offer an outdoor-sports competition for families .
and retailers such as globetrotter and the cologne-based blackfoot regularly offer classes and seminars aimed at families .
nostalgic trend also , the renewed interest in the great outdoors may be part of a general nostalgic trend sweeping through germany , according to travel researcher aderhold .
" younger people are n't rejecting the home market anymore , " he said .
" the alps , in germany as well as austria and switzerland , are back in fashion to some extent . "
finally - and possibly most importantly - the retailers note that what once counted as a specialist product now has a much larger use in the marketplace .
businessmen carry backpacks , kids wear gore-tex hiking boots to school , and housewives put on their ultra-light , breathable , all-weather jacket to go to the market .
" it used to be these things were just for the hardcore outdoorsman , " bartmann said .

but with tony blair ’ s labour party set to win a third term on right-leaning policies , the question should be : " whatever happened to the third way ? " the 2005 british general election on thursday may seem to some voters as a step back in time .
just as it was in the 1997 election , in which tony blair first swept to office on the back of a euphoric landslide victory , the labor party is the unbeatable favorite while the opposition conservative party is in deep disarray . but it 's wrong to think that british politics has remained stuck in a time-warp since the late 1990s .
many things have changed , including the government that is running , and is likely to continue running , the country .
it may still be a labor government in name but much of the ideology associated with that name has been abandoned . to chart the change , one must start with that first landslide victory .
that heady summer of 1997 was filled with buzzwords cultivated by the bright young things on the left .
the labor party had been remade in blair 's image of new labor and socialism , a word and concept rendered unutterable by consecutive tory governments , had been replaced by the third way , a path between right and left which would allow market driven politics to be combined with social idealism . blairite masterminds had developed a strategy that would appeal to the traditional socialists and social democrats on the one hand and the advocates of thatcherite free-market conservatism on the other . courting middle england and the working class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third way promised the electorate a combination of conservative market orientation with the social idealism of the labor movement .

at the end of the 1990s , 13 of the eu 's old 15 member states were run by center-left governments .
the british prime minister saw this as an opportunity to remake europe in the new labor image and with the continent wrapped up in the good feeling of sweeping decades of conservatism aside , blair set about spreading the third way .
he found willing participants in lionel jospin in france and giuliano amato in italy .

schröder , a former chairman of the radical social democratic student association , fought and won the election on his pledges to bring economic stability and development to germany and to increase domestic security and continuity in foreign affairs . a charismatic young leader , schröder was quick to associate himself with tony blair and us president bill clinton as one of the " new breed " of center-left leaders who were driving their countries away from conservative governments which had been led by the likes of kohl , ronald reagan and margaret thatcher .

just as it was in the 1997 election , in which tony blair first swept to office on the back of a euphoric landslide victory , the labor party is the unbeatable favorite while the opposition conservative party is in deep disarray . but it 's wrong to think that british politics has remained stuck in a time-warp since the late 1990s .
many things have changed , including the government that is running , and is likely to continue running , the country .

it did n't take long for schröder to be seduced by the third way . in june 1999 , schröder and blair came together to write and publish the center-left manifesto " europe : the third way / die neue mitte . "
the leaders of great britain and germany were now working together to advocate a change to the traditional policy instruments in areas such as the concept of social justice , the role of the state , the balance between individualism and collectivism , and entrepreneurial spirit .

travel researcher aderhold explained said that in the past , a german retiree 's vacation consisted of sitting in his backyard .
today , " a 65 year old will do things that they would n't have done years ago , " he said .
" a hiking tour in south america or something , they 're doing activities that we used to associate with 30- or 40-year-olds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiking seniors and retirees who take such trips tend to be at an age where they can afford high quality clothing and equipment .
" they want the best textiles , nice bags , good shoes , " globetrotter 's bartmann said .
" and they want sales assistance . "
another booming sector is families , bartmann said .
even if most people do chose relaxation trips , many are opting for " adventurous " activities like canoe trips and camping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : camping family the sector has increased noticeably over the past five years , bartmann noted .
" you come into our store on a friday night and it is just full of families with children .
in the end it may still be a small segment of the market , but previously it did n't exist at all .
so it is very important for our sales . "
trying to make the most out of this development , outdoor companies increasingly aim their marketing campaigns at families .
one example is the cooperation jack wolfskin , germany 's largest outdoor goods manufacturer , started with mercedes benz in 2004 to offer an outdoor-sports competition for families .
and retailers such as globetrotter and the cologne-based blackfoot regularly offer classes and seminars aimed at families .
nostalgic trend also , the renewed interest in the great outdoors may be part of a general nostalgic trend sweeping through germany , according to travel researcher aderhold .

back to first page back 2/2 right wing governments made a comeback slowly , however , the third way balloon deflated .
attitudes across europe changed in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states and subsequent elections in europe brought back conservative governments on the back of immigration and security issues .
soon blair and schröder would be members of a very exclusive club , the dwindling center-left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both schröder and blair managed to secure second terms , keeping the number of center-left governments in europe at five .
but both had fought their second elections with very different approaches to their first . blair was re-elected before sept .
11 in 2001 , but if he had waited until after the attacks , he may still have got in .
labor had drifted , or more correctly been steered further towards the right in its first four years in government under blair . blair moved further right on former tory support his reforms of the legal system - which some claimed cruelly curtailed civil liberties , the privatization of air traffic control , the encouragement of private investment in the public services , the imposition of commercial management on institutions such as the rail system and the competitive ethos on hospitals and schools could have been policies implemented by a conservative government .
indeed , while labor lost staunch support over such policies , blair continued to court the middle classes and picked up votes by attracting disillusioned voters who had abandoned the tories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany in 2002 , schröder narrowly avoided being booted out by adopting a hard line against the preparations for war in iraq and then still had to rely on a good showing by his green coalition partners to get the majority he needed to form a new government . while tony blair seemed to have found the right amount of blue to mix with his red , schröder was a mixture of colors and messages .
high unemployment and an ailing economy had forced him into considering an overhaul of the social welfare system - which went against his social democrat beliefs - while the growing storm of war had forced his hand in standing against the right-wing fervor of the ' coalition of the willing . ' second terms saw the third way floundering by their second terms , both blair and schröder were drifting further from their third way vision .
as a possible third term beckons for blair , and with schröder eyeing a third election in 2006 , do they still stand on the neue mitte four years down the line ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's support for the war in iraq , his siding with a republican president in the united states and increased curbs on civil liberties as part of justice reform all point to a stronger swing to the right since the last election . election 2005 sees blair blue and unabashed this time around , apparently liberated by his decision not to run again after these elections , blair is giving barely an inch on the more conservative parts of his agenda .
under his leadership , labor have abandoned public ownership and have made no secret of the desire to rely on competition and the private sector rather than state funding to supply public services , all things the 2005 election policies endorse . schröder , on the other hand , seems to be heading back to the left as a state election in the industrial heartland of north rhine westphalia looms on may 22 .
the spd seems to be scrambling to revive their left-wing credentials in a bid to avoid being booted out of one of the party 's traditional strongholds . schröder and comrades signal left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader müntefering has been added to marx , engels and lenin in this cartoon the spd have been seen to be riding to the defense of industry recently in response to this threat , with schröder and spd chairman franz müntefering advocating the outlawing of suggested " short-term " investment tactics - people " making quick money and moving on .

but with tony blair ’ s labour party set to win a third term on right-leaning policies , the question should be : " whatever happened to the third way ? " the 2005 british general election on thursday may seem to some voters as a step back in time .
just as it was in the 1997 election , in which tony blair first swept to office on the back of a euphoric landslide victory , the labor party is the unbeatable favorite while the opposition conservative party is in deep disarray . but it 's wrong to think that british politics has remained stuck in a time-warp since the late 1990s .
many things have changed , including the government that is running , and is likely to continue running , the country .
it may still be a labor government in name but much of the ideology associated with that name has been abandoned . to chart the change , one must start with that first landslide victory .
that heady summer of 1997 was filled with buzzwords cultivated by the bright young things on the left .
the labor party had been remade in blair 's image of new labor and socialism , a word and concept rendered unutterable by consecutive tory governments , had been replaced by the third way , a path between right and left which would allow market driven politics to be combined with social idealism . blairite masterminds had developed a strategy that would appeal to the traditional socialists and social democrats on the one hand and the advocates of thatcherite free-market conservatism on the other . courting middle england and the working class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third way promised the electorate a combination of conservative market orientation with the social idealism of the labor movement .
in place of arguments about the age-old ' tax and spend ' approach , the third way would deliver improved public services while lowering taxes .
while keeping the working classes sweet , blair was also courting middle england .
it worked beautifully . once in power , it was revealed that blair 's vision did n't end there .
at the end of the 1990s , 13 of the eu 's old 15 member states were run by center-left governments .
the british prime minister saw this as an opportunity to remake europe in the new labor image and with the continent wrapped up in the good feeling of sweeping decades of conservatism aside , blair set about spreading the third way .
he found willing participants in lionel jospin in france and giuliano amato in italy .
but few were more convinced at the time than newly elected german chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder joins wave of center-left optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democrats came into power in 1998 after 16 years in opposition to helmut kohl 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
schröder , a former chairman of the radical social democratic student association , fought and won the election on his pledges to bring economic stability and development to germany and to increase domestic security and continuity in foreign affairs . a charismatic young leader , schröder was quick to associate himself with tony blair and us president bill clinton as one of the " new breed " of center-left leaders who were driving their countries away from conservative governments which had been led by the likes of kohl , ronald reagan and margaret thatcher .
it did n't take long for schröder to be seduced by the third way . in june 1999 , schröder and blair came together to write and publish the center-left manifesto " europe : the third way / die neue mitte . "
the leaders of great britain and germany were now working together to advocate a change to the traditional policy instruments in areas such as the concept of social justice , the role of the state , the balance between individualism and collectivism , and entrepreneurial spirit .

but with tony blair ’ s labour party set to win a third term on right-leaning policies , the question should be : " whatever happened to the third way ? " the 2005 british general election on thursday may seem to some voters as a step back in time .
just as it was in the 1997 election , in which tony blair first swept to office on the back of a euphoric landslide victory , the labor party is the unbeatable favorite while the opposition conservative party is in deep disarray . but it 's wrong to think that british politics has remained stuck in a time-warp since the late 1990s .
many things have changed , including the government that is running , and is likely to continue running , the country .
it may still be a labor government in name but much of the ideology associated with that name has been abandoned . to chart the change , one must start with that first landslide victory .
that heady summer of 1997 was filled with buzzwords cultivated by the bright young things on the left .
the labor party had been remade in blair 's image of new labor and socialism , a word and concept rendered unutterable by consecutive tory governments , had been replaced by the third way , a path between right and left which would allow market driven politics to be combined with social idealism . blairite masterminds had developed a strategy that would appeal to the traditional socialists and social democrats on the one hand and the advocates of thatcherite free-market conservatism on the other . courting middle england and the working class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third way promised the electorate a combination of conservative market orientation with the social idealism of the labor movement .
in place of arguments about the age-old ' tax and spend ' approach , the third way would deliver improved public services while lowering taxes .
while keeping the working classes sweet , blair was also courting middle england .
it worked beautifully . once in power , it was revealed that blair 's vision did n't end there .
at the end of the 1990s , 13 of the eu 's old 15 member states were run by center-left governments .
the british prime minister saw this as an opportunity to remake europe in the new labor image and with the continent wrapped up in the good feeling of sweeping decades of conservatism aside , blair set about spreading the third way .
he found willing participants in lionel jospin in france and giuliano amato in italy .

schröder , a former chairman of the radical social democratic student association , fought and won the election on his pledges to bring economic stability and development to germany and to increase domestic security and continuity in foreign affairs . a charismatic young leader , schröder was quick to associate himself with tony blair and us president bill clinton as one of the " new breed " of center-left leaders who were driving their countries away from conservative governments which had been led by the likes of kohl , ronald reagan and margaret thatcher .
it did n't take long for schröder to be seduced by the third way . in june 1999 , schröder and blair came together to write and publish the center-left manifesto " europe : the third way / die neue mitte . "
the leaders of great britain and germany were now working together to advocate a change to the traditional policy instruments in areas such as the concept of social justice , the role of the state , the balance between individualism and collectivism , and entrepreneurial spirit .

his family spent the war in the soviet union , and survived the conflict intact - a rarity for polish jews . " i think this march is the right thing , as far as the future is concerned , to remember what happened .

stable sales outdoor products have become responsible for 31 percent of the overall sporting goods market , up from 27 percent in 2001 .
and while most german retail sectors saw decreased sales over the past year , revenues in the outdoor sector remained relatively stable , totaling 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.94 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
" our industry has seen a relatively stable level of sales - somewhere between negative 0.3 percent to zero percent sales growth , " said andreas bartmann , ceo of globetrotter , germany 's largest sporting goods and outdoor-equipment retailer .
" but other industries have had it much worse .
the textile industry was down a full 2 percent last year . "

some germans , however , finally acted against what had become an " orgy of terror . " june 6 , 1944 , d-day , was the beginning of the end for nazi germany .
the allies in the west had finally pierced fortress europe , and adolf hitler saw his vision of a " thousand-year reich " progressively loosing currency .
the killing machine that the nazis had used against the rest of europe now turned on its own people - at all levels .
klaus von stauffenberg ’ s attempt to assassinate hitler was certainly the most prominent case of resistance .
in the final months , anyone who even raised a whisper against nazi germany acted heroically but paid the highest price , as hitler , in desperation , was willing to sacrifice everything and everybody .
less than five months after d-day , the first german city had fallen into the hands of the us army - aachen .
the americans did not wait long to return control to a german and , on october 21 installed franz oppenhoff as the city 's mayor - not so much to govern , but rather to regain some semblance of normalcy .

" the task is seemingly hopeless and is almost beyond our strength .

few people were aware that oppenhoff was the man in charge .
" no names were ever officially named , " said otto pesch , a journalist who would become editor-in-chief of the first german non-nazi newspaper , aachener nachrichten , in 1945 .
oppenhoff knew that his new title , his new duties , would endanger his life .
as if he had had a sixth sense , he told his wife numerous times : " somewhere a parachutist is ready and waiting to kill me . "
" for months everything was quiet , " said pesch .
" nobody reckoned with murder . "
ss chief heinrich himmler , however , had already called for oppenhoff ’ s " removal . "
unrelenting terror oppenhoff , a catholic lawyer who had represented jews and catholic priests from aachen , was now considered a traitor as a collaborator with the americans .
hitler had promised in his so-called werewolf speech in march 1945 that blood would flow , even behind enemy lines .
the germans used a b-17 bomber to drop six " werewolves , " including a teenage boy and a teenage girl .
their orders came directly from himmler - kill oppenhoff .

oppenhoff unsuspectingly invited them in , offering them bread .

on april 22 , us tank divisions were nearing the city on the danube with its traditional gothic cathedral and much of the town still intact .
but commissar ludwig ruckdeschel 's order was intended to leave the bavarian city in ashes : " defend regensburg to the end ! "
the next day , hundreds of citizens gathered up the courage to protest .
regensburg cathedral priest johann maier tried to organize the city 's peaceful surrender until he was whisked away by plainclothes policemen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a chicken farmer , ss head heinrich himmler led an extinction campaign also against the germans in the waning months of world war ii a hastily organized court-martial condemned maier to death .
the late date of his arrest and the fact that he was a clergyman gave maier some hope that he would receive a stay of execution .
but maier waited in vain for his rescue .
his superior , regenburg ’ s bishop buchberger , did not even try to delay the execution .
out of fear for his life - or possibly shame - buchberger resigned his position , having defended his inaction in the matter by saying an attempted intervention would have been without a chance .
on april 25 at 3:25 a.m. , maier was one of two men hanged .
it was the last act of the ss in regensburg , after which they vacated the city without putting up a fight .
villages still under firm control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds remaining in the city of regensburg protested against and prevented a fight at all costs , yet the ss made some pay the price three days later , a group of german officers in munich who called themselves freiheitsaktion bayern , or " operation freedom for bavaria , " prepared for the eminent collapse of the third reich .
the group seized control of a radio station .
" attention !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.05.2005 the killing machine turns on its own 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis punished all resistance in the final months of world war ii , the nazis increased their savagery against the german population .
some germans , however , finally acted against what had become an " orgy of terror . " june 6 , 1944 , d-day , was the beginning of the end for nazi germany .
the allies in the west had finally pierced fortress europe , and adolf hitler saw his vision of a " thousand-year reich " progressively loosing currency .
the killing machine that the nazis had used against the rest of europe now turned on its own people - at all levels .
klaus von stauffenberg ’ s attempt to assassinate hitler was certainly the most prominent case of resistance .
in the final months , anyone who even raised a whisper against nazi germany acted heroically but paid the highest price , as hitler , in desperation , was willing to sacrifice everything and everybody .
less than five months after d-day , the first german city had fallen into the hands of the us army - aachen .
the americans did not wait long to return control to a german and , on october 21 installed franz oppenhoff as the city 's mayor - not so much to govern , but rather to regain some semblance of normalcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to help the city get back on its feet , aachen 's first non-nazi mayor franz oppenhoff was executed by ss " werewolves " on march 25 " there is nothing to administer .
everything has to be started over , " wrote oppenhoff -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the task is seemingly hopeless and is almost beyond our strength .
but it ’ s our duty of conscience to start working . "
few people were aware that oppenhoff was the man in charge .
" no names were ever officially named , " said otto pesch , a journalist who would become editor-in-chief of the first german non-nazi newspaper , aachener nachrichten , in 1945 .
oppenhoff knew that his new title , his new duties , would endanger his life .
as if he had had a sixth sense , he told his wife numerous times : " somewhere a parachutist is ready and waiting to kill me . "
" for months everything was quiet , " said pesch .
" nobody reckoned with murder . "
ss chief heinrich himmler , however , had already called for oppenhoff ’ s " removal . "
unrelenting terror oppenhoff , a catholic lawyer who had represented jews and catholic priests from aachen , was now considered a traitor as a collaborator with the americans .
hitler had promised in his so-called werewolf speech in march 1945 that blood would flow , even behind enemy lines .
the germans used a b-17 bomber to drop six " werewolves , " including a teenage boy and a teenage girl .
their orders came directly from himmler - kill oppenhoff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the citizens of aachen , here fleeing the city in 1944 , were some of the first to live under allied occupation the boy and the girl had entered the city to find out his address .
on march 25 , two of the werewolves , ss men , went to oppenhoff ’ s home in aachen .
oppenhoff unsuspectingly invited them in , offering them bread .
seconds later , he lay on the floor dead with a single gunshot to his head .
nazi propaganda celebrated the " assassination . "
however , operation karneval , as it was called , would remain the only successful mission carried out by the werewolves .

on april 22 , us tank divisions were nearing the city on the danube with its traditional gothic cathedral and much of the town still intact .
but commissar ludwig ruckdeschel 's order was intended to leave the bavarian city in ashes : " defend regensburg to the end ! "
the next day , hundreds of citizens gathered up the courage to protest .
regensburg cathedral priest johann maier tried to organize the city 's peaceful surrender until he was whisked away by plainclothes policemen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a chicken farmer , ss head heinrich himmler led an extinction campaign also against the germans in the waning months of world war ii a hastily organized court-martial condemned maier to death .
the late date of his arrest and the fact that he was a clergyman gave maier some hope that he would receive a stay of execution .
but maier waited in vain for his rescue .
his superior , regenburg ’ s bishop buchberger , did not even try to delay the execution .
out of fear for his life - or possibly shame - buchberger resigned his position , having defended his inaction in the matter by saying an attempted intervention would have been without a chance .
on april 25 at 3:25 a.m. , maier was one of two men hanged .
it was the last act of the ss in regensburg , after which they vacated the city without putting up a fight .
villages still under firm control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds remaining in the city of regensburg protested against and prevented a fight at all costs , yet the ss made some pay the price three days later , a group of german officers in munich who called themselves freiheitsaktion bayern , or " operation freedom for bavaria , " prepared for the eminent collapse of the third reich .
the group seized control of a radio station .
" attention !
attention !
you are listening to the radio station operation freedom for bavaria ! … the codeword ‘ pheasant hunt ’ is being transmitted , " they broadcast .
" workers , protect your factories against sabotage by the nazis .
secure work and bread for the future … prevent the functionaries from entering your factories ! "
they called on listeners to raise the blue and white bavarian flag that would send a surrender signal to approaching us troops .
in the village of götting , south of munich , teacher georg hangl and priest josef grimm followed the orders , removing the nazi swastika flag from the steeple and raising the bavarian flag in the early morning hours .
their actions had fatal consequences .
an ss unit took the two men into custody and interrogated them .
then the two men were taken to a forest outside of götting , beaten and shot .
later that evening , the ss troops , wearing civilian clothes , evacuated the village .
people like oppenhoff , despite a latent existing danger , attempted to start the rebuilding process before hostilities were over .
maier , grimm and hangl , aware of how desperate the situation was , acted to prevent the complete destruction of their towns .
nazi germany , though , failed in its bid to dominate and suffered the consequences - not only under a storm of bombs or the wheels of the rapidly advancing red army in the east and american and british forces in the west , but also in the cogs of the nazi machinery itself . john kluempers , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a historical snapshot of fear and doubt the diary of a dutch teenager awaiting deportation from an internment facility to a nazi death camp in 1943 has resurfaced in a local library in the netherlands .

some germans , however , finally acted against what had become an " orgy of terror . " june 6 , 1944 , d-day , was the beginning of the end for nazi germany .
the allies in the west had finally pierced fortress europe , and adolf hitler saw his vision of a " thousand-year reich " progressively loosing currency .
the killing machine that the nazis had used against the rest of europe now turned on its own people - at all levels .
klaus von stauffenberg ’ s attempt to assassinate hitler was certainly the most prominent case of resistance .
in the final months , anyone who even raised a whisper against nazi germany acted heroically but paid the highest price , as hitler , in desperation , was willing to sacrifice everything and everybody .
less than five months after d-day , the first german city had fallen into the hands of the us army - aachen .
the americans did not wait long to return control to a german and , on october 21 installed franz oppenhoff as the city 's mayor - not so much to govern , but rather to regain some semblance of normalcy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to help the city get back on its feet , aachen 's first non-nazi mayor franz oppenhoff was executed by ss " werewolves " on march 25 " there is nothing to administer .
everything has to be started over , " wrote oppenhoff -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the task is seemingly hopeless and is almost beyond our strength .
but it ’ s our duty of conscience to start working . "
few people were aware that oppenhoff was the man in charge .
" no names were ever officially named , " said otto pesch , a journalist who would become editor-in-chief of the first german non-nazi newspaper , aachener nachrichten , in 1945 .
oppenhoff knew that his new title , his new duties , would endanger his life .
as if he had had a sixth sense , he told his wife numerous times : " somewhere a parachutist is ready and waiting to kill me . "
" for months everything was quiet , " said pesch .
" nobody reckoned with murder . "
ss chief heinrich himmler , however , had already called for oppenhoff ’ s " removal . "
unrelenting terror oppenhoff , a catholic lawyer who had represented jews and catholic priests from aachen , was now considered a traitor as a collaborator with the americans .
hitler had promised in his so-called werewolf speech in march 1945 that blood would flow , even behind enemy lines .
the germans used a b-17 bomber to drop six " werewolves , " including a teenage boy and a teenage girl .
their orders came directly from himmler - kill oppenhoff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the citizens of aachen , here fleeing the city in 1944 , were some of the first to live under allied occupation the boy and the girl had entered the city to find out his address .
on march 25 , two of the werewolves , ss men , went to oppenhoff ’ s home in aachen .
oppenhoff unsuspectingly invited them in , offering them bread .
seconds later , he lay on the floor dead with a single gunshot to his head .
nazi propaganda celebrated the " assassination . "
however , operation karneval , as it was called , would remain the only successful mission carried out by the werewolves .
what the werewolves were unable to do behind enemy lines , namely kill supposed german collaborators , the much-feared ss did in cities , towns and villages that remained under nazi control .
berlin historian johannes tuchel described these last months as an " orgy of terror . "

on april 22 , us tank divisions were nearing the city on the danube with its traditional gothic cathedral and much of the town still intact .
but commissar ludwig ruckdeschel 's order was intended to leave the bavarian city in ashes : " defend regensburg to the end ! "
the next day , hundreds of citizens gathered up the courage to protest .
regensburg cathedral priest johann maier tried to organize the city 's peaceful surrender until he was whisked away by plainclothes policemen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a chicken farmer , ss head heinrich himmler led an extinction campaign also against the germans in the waning months of world war ii a hastily organized court-martial condemned maier to death .
the late date of his arrest and the fact that he was a clergyman gave maier some hope that he would receive a stay of execution .
but maier waited in vain for his rescue .
his superior , regenburg ’ s bishop buchberger , did not even try to delay the execution .
out of fear for his life - or possibly shame - buchberger resigned his position , having defended his inaction in the matter by saying an attempted intervention would have been without a chance .
on april 25 at 3:25 a.m. , maier was one of two men hanged .
it was the last act of the ss in regensburg , after which they vacated the city without putting up a fight .
villages still under firm control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds remaining in the city of regensburg protested against and prevented a fight at all costs , yet the ss made some pay the price three days later , a group of german officers in munich who called themselves freiheitsaktion bayern , or " operation freedom for bavaria , " prepared for the eminent collapse of the third reich .
the group seized control of a radio station .
" attention !
attention !
you are listening to the radio station operation freedom for bavaria ! … the codeword ‘ pheasant hunt ’ is being transmitted , " they broadcast .
" workers , protect your factories against sabotage by the nazis .
secure work and bread for the future … prevent the functionaries from entering your factories ! "
they called on listeners to raise the blue and white bavarian flag that would send a surrender signal to approaching us troops .
in the village of götting , south of munich , teacher georg hangl and priest josef grimm followed the orders , removing the nazi swastika flag from the steeple and raising the bavarian flag in the early morning hours .
their actions had fatal consequences .
an ss unit took the two men into custody and interrogated them .
then the two men were taken to a forest outside of götting , beaten and shot .
later that evening , the ss troops , wearing civilian clothes , evacuated the village .
people like oppenhoff , despite a latent existing danger , attempted to start the rebuilding process before hostilities were over .
maier , grimm and hangl , aware of how desperate the situation was , acted to prevent the complete destruction of their towns .
nazi germany , though , failed in its bid to dominate and suffered the consequences - not only under a storm of bombs or the wheels of the rapidly advancing red army in the east and american and british forces in the west , but also in the cogs of the nazi machinery itself . john kluempers , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a historical snapshot of fear and doubt the diary of a dutch teenager awaiting deportation from an internment facility to a nazi death camp in 1943 has resurfaced in a local library in the netherlands .

some germans , however , finally acted against what had become an " orgy of terror . " june 6 , 1944 , d-day , was the beginning of the end for nazi germany .
the allies in the west had finally pierced fortress europe , and adolf hitler saw his vision of a " thousand-year reich " progressively loosing currency .
the killing machine that the nazis had used against the rest of europe now turned on its own people - at all levels .
klaus von stauffenberg ’ s attempt to assassinate hitler was certainly the most prominent case of resistance .
in the final months , anyone who even raised a whisper against nazi germany acted heroically but paid the highest price , as hitler , in desperation , was willing to sacrifice everything and everybody .
less than five months after d-day , the first german city had fallen into the hands of the us army - aachen .
the americans did not wait long to return control to a german and , on october 21 installed franz oppenhoff as the city 's mayor - not so much to govern , but rather to regain some semblance of normalcy .

" the task is seemingly hopeless and is almost beyond our strength .

few people were aware that oppenhoff was the man in charge .
" no names were ever officially named , " said otto pesch , a journalist who would become editor-in-chief of the first german non-nazi newspaper , aachener nachrichten , in 1945 .
oppenhoff knew that his new title , his new duties , would endanger his life .
as if he had had a sixth sense , he told his wife numerous times : " somewhere a parachutist is ready and waiting to kill me . "
" for months everything was quiet , " said pesch .
" nobody reckoned with murder . "
ss chief heinrich himmler , however , had already called for oppenhoff ’ s " removal . "
unrelenting terror oppenhoff , a catholic lawyer who had represented jews and catholic priests from aachen , was now considered a traitor as a collaborator with the americans .
hitler had promised in his so-called werewolf speech in march 1945 that blood would flow , even behind enemy lines .
the germans used a b-17 bomber to drop six " werewolves , " including a teenage boy and a teenage girl .
their orders came directly from himmler - kill oppenhoff .

the allies in the west had finally pierced fortress europe , and adolf hitler saw his vision of a " thousand-year reich " progressively loosing currency .
the killing machine that the nazis had used against the rest of europe now turned on its own people - at all levels .
klaus von stauffenberg ’ s attempt to assassinate hitler was certainly the most prominent case of resistance .
in the final months , anyone who even raised a whisper against nazi germany acted heroically but paid the highest price , as hitler , in desperation , was willing to sacrifice everything and everybody .

hitler had promised in his so-called werewolf speech in march 1945 that blood would flow , even behind enemy lines .

on april 22 , us tank divisions were nearing the city on the danube with its traditional gothic cathedral and much of the town still intact .
but commissar ludwig ruckdeschel 's order was intended to leave the bavarian city in ashes : " defend regensburg to the end ! "
the next day , hundreds of citizens gathered up the courage to protest .
regensburg cathedral priest johann maier tried to organize the city 's peaceful surrender until he was whisked away by plainclothes policemen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a chicken farmer , ss head heinrich himmler led an extinction campaign also against the germans in the waning months of world war ii a hastily organized court-martial condemned maier to death .
the late date of his arrest and the fact that he was a clergyman gave maier some hope that he would receive a stay of execution .
but maier waited in vain for his rescue .
his superior , regenburg ’ s bishop buchberger , did not even try to delay the execution .
out of fear for his life - or possibly shame - buchberger resigned his position , having defended his inaction in the matter by saying an attempted intervention would have been without a chance .
on april 25 at 3:25 a.m. , maier was one of two men hanged .
it was the last act of the ss in regensburg , after which they vacated the city without putting up a fight .
villages still under firm control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds remaining in the city of regensburg protested against and prevented a fight at all costs , yet the ss made some pay the price three days later , a group of german officers in munich who called themselves freiheitsaktion bayern , or " operation freedom for bavaria , " prepared for the eminent collapse of the third reich .
the group seized control of a radio station .
" attention !
attention !
you are listening to the radio station operation freedom for bavaria ! … the codeword ‘ pheasant hunt ’ is being transmitted , " they broadcast .
" workers , protect your factories against sabotage by the nazis .
secure work and bread for the future … prevent the functionaries from entering your factories ! "
they called on listeners to raise the blue and white bavarian flag that would send a surrender signal to approaching us troops .
in the village of götting , south of munich , teacher georg hangl and priest josef grimm followed the orders , removing the nazi swastika flag from the steeple and raising the bavarian flag in the early morning hours .
their actions had fatal consequences .
an ss unit took the two men into custody and interrogated them .
then the two men were taken to a forest outside of götting , beaten and shot .
later that evening , the ss troops , wearing civilian clothes , evacuated the village .
people like oppenhoff , despite a latent existing danger , attempted to start the rebuilding process before hostilities were over .
maier , grimm and hangl , aware of how desperate the situation was , acted to prevent the complete destruction of their towns .
nazi germany , though , failed in its bid to dominate and suffered the consequences - not only under a storm of bombs or the wheels of the rapidly advancing red army in the east and american and british forces in the west , but also in the cogs of the nazi machinery itself . john kluempers , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a historical snapshot of fear and doubt the diary of a dutch teenager awaiting deportation from an internment facility to a nazi death camp in 1943 has resurfaced in a local library in the netherlands .

on april 22 , us tank divisions were nearing the city on the danube with its traditional gothic cathedral and much of the town still intact .
but commissar ludwig ruckdeschel 's order was intended to leave the bavarian city in ashes : " defend regensburg to the end ! "
the next day , hundreds of citizens gathered up the courage to protest .
regensburg cathedral priest johann maier tried to organize the city 's peaceful surrender until he was whisked away by plainclothes policemen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a chicken farmer , ss head heinrich himmler led an extinction campaign also against the germans in the waning months of world war ii a hastily organized court-martial condemned maier to death .
the late date of his arrest and the fact that he was a clergyman gave maier some hope that he would receive a stay of execution .
but maier waited in vain for his rescue .
his superior , regenburg ’ s bishop buchberger , did not even try to delay the execution .
out of fear for his life - or possibly shame - buchberger resigned his position , having defended his inaction in the matter by saying an attempted intervention would have been without a chance .
on april 25 at 3:25 a.m. , maier was one of two men hanged .
it was the last act of the ss in regensburg , after which they vacated the city without putting up a fight .
villages still under firm control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds remaining in the city of regensburg protested against and prevented a fight at all costs , yet the ss made some pay the price three days later , a group of german officers in munich who called themselves freiheitsaktion bayern , or " operation freedom for bavaria , " prepared for the eminent collapse of the third reich .
the group seized control of a radio station .
" attention !
attention !
you are listening to the radio station operation freedom for bavaria ! … the codeword ‘ pheasant hunt ’ is being transmitted , " they broadcast .
" workers , protect your factories against sabotage by the nazis .
secure work and bread for the future … prevent the functionaries from entering your factories ! "
they called on listeners to raise the blue and white bavarian flag that would send a surrender signal to approaching us troops .
in the village of götting , south of munich , teacher georg hangl and priest josef grimm followed the orders , removing the nazi swastika flag from the steeple and raising the bavarian flag in the early morning hours .
their actions had fatal consequences .
an ss unit took the two men into custody and interrogated them .
then the two men were taken to a forest outside of götting , beaten and shot .
later that evening , the ss troops , wearing civilian clothes , evacuated the village .
people like oppenhoff , despite a latent existing danger , attempted to start the rebuilding process before hostilities were over .
maier , grimm and hangl , aware of how desperate the situation was , acted to prevent the complete destruction of their towns .

on april 22 , us tank divisions were nearing the city on the danube with its traditional gothic cathedral and much of the town still intact .
but commissar ludwig ruckdeschel 's order was intended to leave the bavarian city in ashes : " defend regensburg to the end ! "
the next day , hundreds of citizens gathered up the courage to protest .
regensburg cathedral priest johann maier tried to organize the city 's peaceful surrender until he was whisked away by plainclothes policemen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a chicken farmer , ss head heinrich himmler led an extinction campaign also against the germans in the waning months of world war ii a hastily organized court-martial condemned maier to death .
the late date of his arrest and the fact that he was a clergyman gave maier some hope that he would receive a stay of execution .
but maier waited in vain for his rescue .
his superior , regenburg ’ s bishop buchberger , did not even try to delay the execution .
out of fear for his life - or possibly shame - buchberger resigned his position , having defended his inaction in the matter by saying an attempted intervention would have been without a chance .
on april 25 at 3:25 a.m. , maier was one of two men hanged .
it was the last act of the ss in regensburg , after which they vacated the city without putting up a fight .

" workers , protect your factories against sabotage by the nazis .

they called on listeners to raise the blue and white bavarian flag that would send a surrender signal to approaching us troops .
in the village of götting , south of munich , teacher georg hangl and priest josef grimm followed the orders , removing the nazi swastika flag from the steeple and raising the bavarian flag in the early morning hours .
their actions had fatal consequences .
an ss unit took the two men into custody and interrogated them .

some germans , however , finally acted against what had become an " orgy of terror . " june 6 , 1944 , d-day , was the beginning of the end for nazi germany .
the allies in the west had finally pierced fortress europe , and adolf hitler saw his vision of a " thousand-year reich " progressively loosing currency .
the killing machine that the nazis had used against the rest of europe now turned on its own people - at all levels .
klaus von stauffenberg ’ s attempt to assassinate hitler was certainly the most prominent case of resistance .
in the final months , anyone who even raised a whisper against nazi germany acted heroically but paid the highest price , as hitler , in desperation , was willing to sacrifice everything and everybody .
less than five months after d-day , the first german city had fallen into the hands of the us army - aachen .
the americans did not wait long to return control to a german and , on october 21 installed franz oppenhoff as the city 's mayor - not so much to govern , but rather to regain some semblance of normalcy .

" the task is seemingly hopeless and is almost beyond our strength .

few people were aware that oppenhoff was the man in charge .
" no names were ever officially named , " said otto pesch , a journalist who would become editor-in-chief of the first german non-nazi newspaper , aachener nachrichten , in 1945 .
oppenhoff knew that his new title , his new duties , would endanger his life .
as if he had had a sixth sense , he told his wife numerous times : " somewhere a parachutist is ready and waiting to kill me . "
" for months everything was quiet , " said pesch .
" nobody reckoned with murder . "
ss chief heinrich himmler , however , had already called for oppenhoff ’ s " removal . "
unrelenting terror oppenhoff , a catholic lawyer who had represented jews and catholic priests from aachen , was now considered a traitor as a collaborator with the americans .
hitler had promised in his so-called werewolf speech in march 1945 that blood would flow , even behind enemy lines .
the germans used a b-17 bomber to drop six " werewolves , " including a teenage boy and a teenage girl .
their orders came directly from himmler - kill oppenhoff .

oppenhoff unsuspectingly invited them in , offering them bread .
seconds later , he lay on the floor dead with a single gunshot to his head .

however , operation karneval , as it was called , would remain the only successful mission carried out by the werewolves .

on april 22 , us tank divisions were nearing the city on the danube with its traditional gothic cathedral and much of the town still intact .
but commissar ludwig ruckdeschel 's order was intended to leave the bavarian city in ashes : " defend regensburg to the end ! "
the next day , hundreds of citizens gathered up the courage to protest .
regensburg cathedral priest johann maier tried to organize the city 's peaceful surrender until he was whisked away by plainclothes policemen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a chicken farmer , ss head heinrich himmler led an extinction campaign also against the germans in the waning months of world war ii a hastily organized court-martial condemned maier to death .
the late date of his arrest and the fact that he was a clergyman gave maier some hope that he would receive a stay of execution .
but maier waited in vain for his rescue .
his superior , regenburg ’ s bishop buchberger , did not even try to delay the execution .
out of fear for his life - or possibly shame - buchberger resigned his position , having defended his inaction in the matter by saying an attempted intervention would have been without a chance .
on april 25 at 3:25 a.m. , maier was one of two men hanged .
it was the last act of the ss in regensburg , after which they vacated the city without putting up a fight .
villages still under firm control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds remaining in the city of regensburg protested against and prevented a fight at all costs , yet the ss made some pay the price three days later , a group of german officers in munich who called themselves freiheitsaktion bayern , or " operation freedom for bavaria , " prepared for the eminent collapse of the third reich .
the group seized control of a radio station .
" attention !
attention !
you are listening to the radio station operation freedom for bavaria ! … the codeword ‘ pheasant hunt ’ is being transmitted , " they broadcast .
" workers , protect your factories against sabotage by the nazis .
secure work and bread for the future … prevent the functionaries from entering your factories ! "
they called on listeners to raise the blue and white bavarian flag that would send a surrender signal to approaching us troops .
in the village of götting , south of munich , teacher georg hangl and priest josef grimm followed the orders , removing the nazi swastika flag from the steeple and raising the bavarian flag in the early morning hours .
their actions had fatal consequences .
an ss unit took the two men into custody and interrogated them .
then the two men were taken to a forest outside of götting , beaten and shot .
later that evening , the ss troops , wearing civilian clothes , evacuated the village .
people like oppenhoff , despite a latent existing danger , attempted to start the rebuilding process before hostilities were over .
maier , grimm and hangl , aware of how desperate the situation was , acted to prevent the complete destruction of their towns .
nazi germany , though , failed in its bid to dominate and suffered the consequences - not only under a storm of bombs or the wheels of the rapidly advancing red army in the east and american and british forces in the west , but also in the cogs of the nazi machinery itself . john kluempers , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a historical snapshot of fear and doubt the diary of a dutch teenager awaiting deportation from an internment facility to a nazi death camp in 1943 has resurfaced in a local library in the netherlands .

the allies in the west had finally pierced fortress europe , and adolf hitler saw his vision of a " thousand-year reich " progressively loosing currency .
the killing machine that the nazis had used against the rest of europe now turned on its own people - at all levels .
klaus von stauffenberg ’ s attempt to assassinate hitler was certainly the most prominent case of resistance .
in the final months , anyone who even raised a whisper against nazi germany acted heroically but paid the highest price , as hitler , in desperation , was willing to sacrifice everything and everybody .

as if he had had a sixth sense , he told his wife numerous times : " somewhere a parachutist is ready and waiting to kill me . "
" for months everything was quiet , " said pesch .
" nobody reckoned with murder . "
ss chief heinrich himmler , however , had already called for oppenhoff ’ s " removal . "
unrelenting terror oppenhoff , a catholic lawyer who had represented jews and catholic priests from aachen , was now considered a traitor as a collaborator with the americans .
hitler had promised in his so-called werewolf speech in march 1945 that blood would flow , even behind enemy lines .

hitler had promised in his so-called werewolf speech in march 1945 that blood would flow , even behind enemy lines .

on april 22 , us tank divisions were nearing the city on the danube with its traditional gothic cathedral and much of the town still intact .
but commissar ludwig ruckdeschel 's order was intended to leave the bavarian city in ashes : " defend regensburg to the end ! "
the next day , hundreds of citizens gathered up the courage to protest .
regensburg cathedral priest johann maier tried to organize the city 's peaceful surrender until he was whisked away by plainclothes policemen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a chicken farmer , ss head heinrich himmler led an extinction campaign also against the germans in the waning months of world war ii a hastily organized court-martial condemned maier to death .
the late date of his arrest and the fact that he was a clergyman gave maier some hope that he would receive a stay of execution .
but maier waited in vain for his rescue .
his superior , regenburg ’ s bishop buchberger , did not even try to delay the execution .
out of fear for his life - or possibly shame - buchberger resigned his position , having defended his inaction in the matter by saying an attempted intervention would have been without a chance .
on april 25 at 3:25 a.m. , maier was one of two men hanged .
it was the last act of the ss in regensburg , after which they vacated the city without putting up a fight .
villages still under firm control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds remaining in the city of regensburg protested against and prevented a fight at all costs , yet the ss made some pay the price three days later , a group of german officers in munich who called themselves freiheitsaktion bayern , or " operation freedom for bavaria , " prepared for the eminent collapse of the third reich .
the group seized control of a radio station .

they called on listeners to raise the blue and white bavarian flag that would send a surrender signal to approaching us troops .

and it 's given the company involved a final warning this morning , breakfast 's graham satchell looked at the detail of the case and we discussed the implications for consumers and telemarketing companies .
graham first began looking into telemarketing back in november 2003 , when we had a story on breakfast about the victims of silent calls .
follow this link to read graham 's original story from november 2003 about silent calls the calls are generated when a telemarketing company tries to cold call a household using a computer that dials 100 numbers .
the first 20 who answer speak to a human being somewhere in a call-centre , but that leaves the computer dialling the other 80 who will hear nothing but silence .
this is because the nominal 20 operators are now talking to people .
if you want help with stopping cold calls , contact the telephone preference service , via the link on the right hand side of this page .
now , in the first case of its kind , the telecommunications watchdog ofcom has investigated one company 's cold calling and found them guilty of causing " annoyance and anxiety " to consumers .
we spoke to vincent wayne-mitchell , from the cass business school .
he suggested three ways in which viewers can prevent unwanted calls .
contact your telephone service provider and ask them to provide an anonymous call rejection service .
contact the telephone preference service and ask for their silent call guard from next month , you will be able to use 1471 to find out the phone number of where the silent call has come from - then you can phone them and ask them to take you off of their list .
on breakfast we also spoke to john price , from the direct marketing association which represents some telemarketing companies .
mr price agreed that consumers need more protection .
he said that much of the problem would be helped if consumers knew who was calling them .

and it 's given the company involved a final warning this morning , breakfast 's graham satchell looked at the detail of the case and we discussed the implications for consumers and telemarketing companies .
graham first began looking into telemarketing back in november 2003 , when we had a story on breakfast about the victims of silent calls .
follow this link to read graham 's original story from november 2003 about silent calls the calls are generated when a telemarketing company tries to cold call a household using a computer that dials 100 numbers .
the first 20 who answer speak to a human being somewhere in a call-centre , but that leaves the computer dialling the other 80 who will hear nothing but silence .
this is because the nominal 20 operators are now talking to people .
if you want help with stopping cold calls , contact the telephone preference service , via the link on the right hand side of this page .
now , in the first case of its kind , the telecommunications watchdog ofcom has investigated one company 's cold calling and found them guilty of causing " annoyance and anxiety " to consumers .
graham satchell 's report on silent calls we spoke to vincent wayne-mitchell , from the cass business school .
he suggested three ways in which viewers can prevent unwanted calls .
contact your telephone service provider and ask them to provide an anonymous call rejection service .
contact the telephone preference service and ask for their silent call guard our interview with vincent wayne-mitchell from next month , you will be able to use 1471 to find out the phone number of where the silent call has come from - then you can phone them and ask them to take you off of their list .
on breakfast we also spoke to john price , from the direct marketing association which represents some telemarketing companies .
mr price agreed that consumers need more protection .
he said that much of the problem would be helped if consumers knew who was calling them .

they were arrested after demonstrating outside a chinese government building in the territory three years ago .
the case was seen as a key test of judicial independence in the former british colony , now a part of china .
falun gong is banned in china and its practitioners complain they are subject to sometimes violent persecution , but they are free to practice in hong kong .
beijing has labelled falun gong an evil cult that threatens society .
in hong kong , there are no such restrictions .
but when a group of falun gong practitioners attempted to hold a peaceful demonstration outside a chinese government office in the territory three years ago , they were arrested by the police and removed .
now after a lengthy legal battle , the courts have quashed the convictions of the eight demonstrators who were arrested - who had been accused of obstructing and assaulting police officers .
legal protest because an earlier court decision had ruled that their demonstration was in fact legal , the court of final appeal decided the falun gong members should not have been prosecuted for resisting what was in effect an illegal attempt by police to arrest and charge them .
a spokesman for falun gong said the group was very pleased with the decision , which showed the police had abused their powers .
the court said the police had found themselves confronted with an extremely difficult situation and should not be criticised unduly .
but the fact remains that hundreds of peaceful demonstrations take place in hong kong each year .
the prosecution of the falun gong followers was extremely unusual .
some will see the quashing of their convictions as evidence of judicial independence in the territory .
others will argue that this shows it was an ill-advised politically motivated prosecution that should never had been brought before the courts in the first place .

chewing khat leaves is popular , particularly among somali men .
but some members of the community have expressed fears over the excessive use of the drug by younger men .
the home office is currently conducting research on khat - which is illegal in the usa , canada , ireland , norway and sweden .
khat is a stimulant , producing a high when chewed , but its use has been linked to long-term health issues such as heart problems and mental illness .
i do n't like it .
there are a few issues why - it is against our religion for one thing and i am worried about the effects it has on health and the financial impact it has ayan mohamed , 21 around seven tonnes of khat leaves , which is an evergreen shrub which grows in mountainous areas across africa , is estimated to be imported into the uk each week from ethiopia , yemen and kenya .
it can be bought for around £ 3 a bunch in parts of cardiff .
the main active ingredient of khat is cathinone , a chemical which is similar to amphetamine .
when cathinone is broken down in the body , it produces chemicals including cathine and norephedrine , which have a similar structure to amphetamines and adrenaline .
the somali community in cardiff is one of the largest in the uk .
several studies have been carried out in the city about khat 's long-term effects .
mental health in one report from 2002 , researchers concluded that chewing khat put users at risk of significant medical and mental health problems .
psychiatrists dr mansfield mela and dr andrew mcbride looked at 61 somalis aged between 18 and 70 .
almost three-quarters -lrb- 72 % -rrb- reported using khat at some time in their lives and almost half -lrb- 46 % -rrb- said that they had used it in the past week , although 53 % said they disapproved of chewing khat .
of those surveyed , 13 % said they chewed khat seven days a week and 19 % described themselves as dependent .
effects of khat use it is a stimulant , making the user more alert and talkative it is an appetite suppressor if chewed over a few hours , it produces a state of calm a chemical found in khat could boost the power of men 's sperm long-term use can bring on insomnia , heart problems and sexual problems can bring on anxiety and aggression can bring on irritability , anger or violence excessive chewing can lead to sore mouths and infections it can bring on depression it is associated with mental health issues among users the khat users reported significant health problems associated with their habit .
these included sleep problems , weight loss , appetite loss , mood swings , irritability , paranoid ideas , nightmares and hallucinations .
abdirkarim adan , director of the somali progressive association in cardiff , said that there was concern over the amount of khat being chewed by some members of the community .
he said that more education was needed about the drug , but was not in favour of it being made illegal .
" i chew khat on the weekends with my friends , " he said .
" it is a cultural and social thing , a bit like going down the pub .
" and it is like anything - if you use too much then there are going to be problems .
it 's the same as alcohol - if you abuse it then you are going to get problems .
" there is a mixed view on the problem of khat - a lot of people i know have given it up because of the health risks associated with it .
i have used it - it is like a social thing , you chew with friends but the next day is pretty awful - you ca n't get up from bed .
i know that some people get really addicted to it and chew it for 12 hours a day - i think that maybe making it illegal would be a good idea muktar mohamed , 28 " it keeps people awake so then they ca n't get up for work the next day - and so of course that has a big effect . "
he said that use of the plant was growing in the community .
" i do think that people are doing it a lot more which is a problem - but how can you guard against excessive use ?
that is the crux of the issue , " he said .
" when people become addicted - when all they want to do is chew it on the weekends and then in their break times .
" i think there needs to be a lot more education and guidelines about khat and how much is safe , " he added .
abdi jama , a youth worker from newport , said that he had seen a rise in use among younger men .
" it is a problem , lots of the teenage boys are taking it up and it has a real effect on them - it is worrying , " he said .
many of the women in the community are against the tradition of chewing khat because of the adverse effect it has on the home and family life and because of religious reasons - islam says that you can not take anything that dulls the mind .

listeners to bbc radio 4 's you and yours programme were invited to vote in an online poll looking at the most significant innovations since 1800 .
it was an easy victory for the bicycle which won more than half of the vote .
the transistor came second with 8 % of the vote , and the electro-magnetic induction ring - the means to harness electricity - came third .
interplanetary travel despite their ubiquity , computers gained just 6 % of the vote and the internet trailed behind with only 4 % of all votes cast .
there were more than 4,500 votes cast in total .
people chose the bicycle for its simplicity of design , universal use , and because it is an ecologically sound means of transport .
top 10 inventions bicycle - 59 % transistor - 8 % electro-magnetic induction ring - 8 % computer - 6 % germ theory of infection - 5 % radio - 5 % internet - 4 % internal combustion engine - 3 % nuclear power - 1 % communications satellite - 1 % the survey also asked participants which innovation they would most like to disinvent .
gm foods came top of this poll with 26 % of the vote , followed by nuclear power with 19 % .
by contrast , the technology most would like to see invented was an aids vaccine .
alas , plans to ship long-suffering commuters to distant planets may need to be put on hold with only 15 % voting for an interplanetary commuting transport system .
half voted water treatment and supply systems as the technology to bring most benefit to society .
another 23 % thought that vaccinations deserved the honour .
each of the technologies were nominated by a different expert , including writer sir arthur c clarke , cloning expert professor ian wilmut , and professor heinz wolff .
prof wolff 's praise of the bicycle held the most sway with voters which will come as a disappointment to lord alec broers , this year 's reith lecturer .
his series of lectures - triumph of technology - prompted the vote .
in the first of his talks , he expressed surprise at the results of a similar survey .
it too ranked the bicycle above scientific breakthroughs such as electricity generation , the jet engine , the discovery of dna and the invention of vaccinations .

listeners to bbc radio 4 's you and yours programme were invited to vote in an online poll looking at the most significant innovations since 1800 .
it was an easy victory for the bicycle which won more than half of the vote .
the transistor came second with 8 % of the vote , and the electro-magnetic induction ring - the means to harness electricity - came third .
interplanetary travel despite their ubiquity , computers gained just 6 % of the vote and the internet trailed behind with only 4 % of all votes cast .
there were more than 4,500 votes cast in total .
people chose the bicycle for its simplicity of design , universal use , and because it is an ecologically sound means of transport .
top 10 inventions bicycle - 59 % transistor - 8 % electro-magnetic induction ring - 8 % computer - 6 % germ theory of infection - 5 % radio - 5 % internet - 4 % internal combustion engine - 3 % nuclear power - 1 % communications satellite - 1 % the survey also asked participants which innovation they would most like to disinvent .
gm foods came top of this poll with 26 % of the vote , followed by nuclear power with 19 % .
by contrast , the technology most would like to see invented was an aids vaccine .
alas , plans to ship long-suffering commuters to distant planets may need to be put on hold with only 15 % voting for an interplanetary commuting transport system .
half voted water treatment and supply systems as the technology to bring most benefit to society .
another 23 % thought that vaccinations deserved the honour .
each of the technologies were nominated by a different expert , including writer sir arthur c clarke , cloning expert professor ian wilmut , and professor heinz wolff .
prof wolff 's praise of the bicycle held the most sway with voters which will come as a disappointment to lord alec broers , this year 's reith lecturer .
his series of lectures - triumph of technology - prompted the vote .
in the first of his talks , he expressed surprise at the results of a similar survey .
it too ranked the bicycle above scientific breakthroughs such as electricity generation , the jet engine , the discovery of dna and the invention of vaccinations .
