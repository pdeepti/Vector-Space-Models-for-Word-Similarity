the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace . hans-jürgen papier , president of germany 's highest court , told the bild am sonntag newspaper that it was still possible to outlaw the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- even though an attempt to do so by the federal government in 2003 was rejected by the justices on procedural grounds . " the suspension of proceedings to ban the npd does not represent a predetermined outcome on future efforts to ban it , " papier wrote in the newspaper .
" these facts need to be remembered . " the german constitution allows groups and political parties that are deemed dangerous due to their support for nazism to be banned .
berlin believes the npd qualifies , but the constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's case to ban the party . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high court judges winfried hassemer and hans-jürgen papier .
since then , the party has flourished , particularly in the former communist east of germany , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments .
last september , the neo-nazi outfit shamed germany by winning nearly 10 percent of the vote in a state election in saxony .
the right-wing extremist have made a point of offending the political mainstream ever since . outrage in saxony demands to take action against the party came to a head last week , when the npd deputies in saxony 's parliament refused to take part in a moment of silence for the victims of the nazis during a commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . before they stormed out of the chamber , the npd parliamentarians had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied " bombing holocaust " of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
german politicians have also called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols , which are also outlawed in germany . constitutional court justice winfried hassemer told der spiegel newsmagazine that despite the last botched case against the far-right party , a ban was still " feasible " if the government took care not to repeat the same mistakes .
he said the court 's ruling in 2003 had " nothing to do with the actual unconstitutionality of this party . " encourgaged by justices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high court judges winfried hassemer and hans-jürgen papier .
the highly unusual public comments by justices papier and hassemer have encouraged some politicians to consider a renewed attempt to ban the npd . " we will have to carefully check in the coming weeks whether we can to come to another assessment regarding the npd ban , " dieter wiefelspütz , interior policy spokesman for the social democrats , told the netzeitung online newspaper . but other officials , mindful of the fallout from the last failure , remain cautious about pressing ahead with another case . " there is n't enough evidence against the npd at the moment , " beckstein told the afp news agency .
he said taking the issue to the constitutional court would " not be wise " considering the possibility of another failed ban giving the far-right extremists even more momentum . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : banning the far-right npd politicians in saxony 's state parliament made no bones about their extreme right-wing views by walking out on a commemoration of holocaust victims .

the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace . hans-jürgen papier , president of germany 's highest court , told the bild am sonntag newspaper that it was still possible to outlaw the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- even though an attempt to do so by the federal government in 2003 was rejected by the justices on procedural grounds . " the suspension of proceedings to ban the npd does not represent a predetermined outcome on future efforts to ban it , " papier wrote in the newspaper .
" these facts need to be remembered . " the german constitution allows groups and political parties that are deemed dangerous due to their support for nazism to be banned .

last september , the neo-nazi outfit shamed germany by winning nearly 10 percent of the vote in a state election in saxony .
the right-wing extremist have made a point of offending the political mainstream ever since . outrage in saxony demands to take action against the party came to a head last week , when the npd deputies in saxony 's parliament refused to take part in a moment of silence for the victims of the nazis during a commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . before they stormed out of the chamber , the npd parliamentarians had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied " bombing holocaust " of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
german politicians have also called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols , which are also outlawed in germany . constitutional court justice winfried hassemer told der spiegel newsmagazine that despite the last botched case against the far-right party , a ban was still " feasible " if the government took care not to repeat the same mistakes .

german politicians have also called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols , which are also outlawed in germany . constitutional court justice winfried hassemer told der spiegel newsmagazine that despite the last botched case against the far-right party , a ban was still " feasible " if the government took care not to repeat the same mistakes .
he said the court 's ruling in 2003 had " nothing to do with the actual unconstitutionality of this party . " encourgaged by justices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high court judges winfried hassemer and hans-jürgen papier .
the highly unusual public comments by justices papier and hassemer have encouraged some politicians to consider a renewed attempt to ban the npd . " we will have to carefully check in the coming weeks whether we can to come to another assessment regarding the npd ban , " dieter wiefelspütz , interior policy spokesman for the social democrats , told the netzeitung online newspaper . but other officials , mindful of the fallout from the last failure , remain cautious about pressing ahead with another case . " there is n't enough evidence against the npd at the moment , " beckstein told the afp news agency .

as things wrap up on sunday , german organic producers are celebrating their rapidly growing market share . in 1926 , the berlin tourist office thought it a good idea to bring the wintertime agricultural conference together with the sale of farming equipment , goods and services that went on outside the meeting 's doors .
and because farmers traditionally wore green clothing , a journalist gave the gathering a name that 's stuck : " green week . "
since then , the green week has established itself as the world 's most significant international agricultural fair . from jan .
21-30 more than 1,600 exhibitors from 55 countries presented their specialties on the fairground , which is as large as 12 soccer-fields .
farmers and city-dwellers , young and old work their ways past colorful stands to the sound of a dixieland band .
exotic foods from asia , wines from africa and australia , meat specialties from the new eu countries and bavarian beer , pretzels and cheese are on offer . " it 's great to meet regional producers .
it 's good for us to compare national and international standards , " said thomas ahrens , a young farmer from lower saxony .
" and of course , it 's important to make new contacts in our globalized world .
it 's hard to make a living as a farmer in germany .
we - the farmers - were entirely dependent on eu subsidies in 2004 .
so we 've got to be part of a community that stands by us . " a pizzas every three days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's most eaten dinner ?
for the german grocery trade , 2004 was a bad year as well .
compared to neighboring countries france , italy and switzerland , germans did n't spend a great deal on food .
a recent study found that , 44 percent of germans do n't even cook their own food .
the average citizen here eats 91 ready-made pizzas annually , the study said .
price-cutting competition between chain stores and supermarkets was the other reason for a slump in the food business . while farmers and the food industry in general has been suffering from germany 's weak economy , one area has been booming and has managed to successfully overhaul its image : organic food .
organically grown food and environment-friendly agriculture were alone in the food industry in announcing a sales increase of 10 percent last year . with names like " eat organic , " " supernatural " and " bio company , " 200 organic supermarkets are in business in germany today .
they sell more than 1,000 products ranging from organic fruits and vegetables to wine , beer , meat , tobacco - and deep-frozen pizza .
organic food stores made € 350 million -lrb- $ 457 million -rrb- in turnover last year .
that makes up for only 2.5 percent of germany 's annual food turnover .
but experts say the organic food market is likely to double in the next five years .
rising demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu politician angela merkel at the green week and they are backed up by agricultural scientists who demand an ecological approach to agriculture worldwide . " we 're poisoning ourselves with modern food - chemistry , pesticides and genetic engineering , " said anita idel , a veterenarian . " illnesses like diabetes are increasing worldwide and only a better quality of food and greater food awareness can stop them , " she added .
" but we , too , have a growing problem in germany : with overweight children .
they go to school without having had breakfast .
and there , they get fast food from vending machines .
we know that 's bad for the brain .
we know bad nutrition will lead to disease . " the supply determines the demand on the organic food market , experts say .
in germany , the supply chain has been improved .
the organic food industry is not only able to guarantee high quality , but can now also provide high quantities .
store owners share 4 percent of the profit with suppliers , compared to less than 1 percent in ordinary supermarkets . there 's an additional advantage according to farmer peer trunkweiler . " the market is growing fast , " he said .
" the consumer demands ecological farming .
and i get a chance to market my vegetables and meat - by myself , in my region .
that means i can get better prices .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.01.2005 high court judge reignites npd ban debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government already tried to ban the npd in 2003 a german constitutional court justice said sunday that the neo-nazi npd party could be banned even though a past attempt failed .
the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace . hans-jürgen papier , president of germany 's highest court , told the bild am sonntag newspaper that it was still possible to outlaw the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- even though an attempt to do so by the federal government in 2003 was rejected by the justices on procedural grounds . " the suspension of proceedings to ban the npd does not represent a predetermined outcome on future efforts to ban it , " papier wrote in the newspaper .
" these facts need to be remembered . " the german constitution allows groups and political parties that are deemed dangerous due to their support for nazism to be banned .
berlin believes the npd qualifies , but the constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's case to ban the party . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high court judges winfried hassemer and hans-jürgen papier .
since then , the party has flourished , particularly in the former communist east of germany , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments .
last september , the neo-nazi outfit shamed germany by winning nearly 10 percent of the vote in a state election in saxony .
the right-wing extremist have made a point of offending the political mainstream ever since . outrage in saxony demands to take action against the party came to a head last week , when the npd deputies in saxony 's parliament refused to take part in a moment of silence for the victims of the nazis during a commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . before they stormed out of the chamber , the npd parliamentarians had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied " bombing holocaust " of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .

the right-wing extremist have made a point of offending the political mainstream ever since . outrage in saxony demands to take action against the party came to a head last week , when the npd deputies in saxony 's parliament refused to take part in a moment of silence for the victims of the nazis during a commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . before they stormed out of the chamber , the npd parliamentarians had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied " bombing holocaust " of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
german politicians have also called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols , which are also outlawed in germany . constitutional court justice winfried hassemer told der spiegel newsmagazine that despite the last botched case against the far-right party , a ban was still " feasible " if the government took care not to repeat the same mistakes .

the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace . hans-jürgen papier , president of germany 's highest court , told the bild am sonntag newspaper that it was still possible to outlaw the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- even though an attempt to do so by the federal government in 2003 was rejected by the justices on procedural grounds .

" these facts need to be remembered . " the german constitution allows groups and political parties that are deemed dangerous due to their support for nazism to be banned .

the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
german politicians have also called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols , which are also outlawed in germany . constitutional court justice winfried hassemer told der spiegel newsmagazine that despite the last botched case against the far-right party , a ban was still " feasible " if the government took care not to repeat the same mistakes .

as things wrap up on sunday , german organic producers are celebrating their rapidly growing market share . in 1926 , the berlin tourist office thought it a good idea to bring the wintertime agricultural conference together with the sale of farming equipment , goods and services that went on outside the meeting 's doors .
and because farmers traditionally wore green clothing , a journalist gave the gathering a name that 's stuck : " green week . "
since then , the green week has established itself as the world 's most significant international agricultural fair . from jan .
21-30 more than 1,600 exhibitors from 55 countries presented their specialties on the fairground , which is as large as 12 soccer-fields .
farmers and city-dwellers , young and old work their ways past colorful stands to the sound of a dixieland band .
exotic foods from asia , wines from africa and australia , meat specialties from the new eu countries and bavarian beer , pretzels and cheese are on offer . " it 's great to meet regional producers .
it 's good for us to compare national and international standards , " said thomas ahrens , a young farmer from lower saxony .
" and of course , it 's important to make new contacts in our globalized world .
it 's hard to make a living as a farmer in germany .
we - the farmers - were entirely dependent on eu subsidies in 2004 .
so we 've got to be part of a community that stands by us . " a pizzas every three days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's most eaten dinner ?
for the german grocery trade , 2004 was a bad year as well .
compared to neighboring countries france , italy and switzerland , germans did n't spend a great deal on food .
a recent study found that , 44 percent of germans do n't even cook their own food .
the average citizen here eats 91 ready-made pizzas annually , the study said .
price-cutting competition between chain stores and supermarkets was the other reason for a slump in the food business . while farmers and the food industry in general has been suffering from germany 's weak economy , one area has been booming and has managed to successfully overhaul its image : organic food .
organically grown food and environment-friendly agriculture were alone in the food industry in announcing a sales increase of 10 percent last year . with names like " eat organic , " " supernatural " and " bio company , " 200 organic supermarkets are in business in germany today .
they sell more than 1,000 products ranging from organic fruits and vegetables to wine , beer , meat , tobacco - and deep-frozen pizza .
organic food stores made € 350 million -lrb- $ 457 million -rrb- in turnover last year .
that makes up for only 2.5 percent of germany 's annual food turnover .
but experts say the organic food market is likely to double in the next five years .
rising demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu politician angela merkel at the green week and they are backed up by agricultural scientists who demand an ecological approach to agriculture worldwide . " we 're poisoning ourselves with modern food - chemistry , pesticides and genetic engineering , " said anita idel , a veterenarian . " illnesses like diabetes are increasing worldwide and only a better quality of food and greater food awareness can stop them , " she added .
" but we , too , have a growing problem in germany : with overweight children .
they go to school without having had breakfast .
and there , they get fast food from vending machines .
we know that 's bad for the brain .
we know bad nutrition will lead to disease . " the supply determines the demand on the organic food market , experts say .
in germany , the supply chain has been improved .
the organic food industry is not only able to guarantee high quality , but can now also provide high quantities .
store owners share 4 percent of the profit with suppliers , compared to less than 1 percent in ordinary supermarkets . there 's an additional advantage according to farmer peer trunkweiler . " the market is growing fast , " he said .
" the consumer demands ecological farming .
and i get a chance to market my vegetables and meat - by myself , in my region .
that means i can get better prices . " for farmers as for customers , the future looks green . peter zimmermann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace . hans-jürgen papier , president of germany 's highest court , told the bild am sonntag newspaper that it was still possible to outlaw the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- even though an attempt to do so by the federal government in 2003 was rejected by the justices on procedural grounds . " the suspension of proceedings to ban the npd does not represent a predetermined outcome on future efforts to ban it , " papier wrote in the newspaper .
" these facts need to be remembered . " the german constitution allows groups and political parties that are deemed dangerous due to their support for nazism to be banned .
berlin believes the npd qualifies , but the constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's case to ban the party . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high court judges winfried hassemer and hans-jürgen papier .
since then , the party has flourished , particularly in the former communist east of germany , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments .
last september , the neo-nazi outfit shamed germany by winning nearly 10 percent of the vote in a state election in saxony .
the right-wing extremist have made a point of offending the political mainstream ever since . outrage in saxony demands to take action against the party came to a head last week , when the npd deputies in saxony 's parliament refused to take part in a moment of silence for the victims of the nazis during a commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . before they stormed out of the chamber , the npd parliamentarians had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied " bombing holocaust " of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
german politicians have also called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols , which are also outlawed in germany . constitutional court justice winfried hassemer told der spiegel newsmagazine that despite the last botched case against the far-right party , a ban was still " feasible " if the government took care not to repeat the same mistakes .
he said the court 's ruling in 2003 had " nothing to do with the actual unconstitutionality of this party . " encourgaged by justices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high court judges winfried hassemer and hans-jürgen papier .

the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace . hans-jürgen papier , president of germany 's highest court , told the bild am sonntag newspaper that it was still possible to outlaw the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- even though an attempt to do so by the federal government in 2003 was rejected by the justices on procedural grounds . " the suspension of proceedings to ban the npd does not represent a predetermined outcome on future efforts to ban it , " papier wrote in the newspaper .
" these facts need to be remembered . " the german constitution allows groups and political parties that are deemed dangerous due to their support for nazism to be banned .
berlin believes the npd qualifies , but the constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's case to ban the party . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high court judges winfried hassemer and hans-jürgen papier .
since then , the party has flourished , particularly in the former communist east of germany , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments .
last september , the neo-nazi outfit shamed germany by winning nearly 10 percent of the vote in a state election in saxony .
the right-wing extremist have made a point of offending the political mainstream ever since . outrage in saxony demands to take action against the party came to a head last week , when the npd deputies in saxony 's parliament refused to take part in a moment of silence for the victims of the nazis during a commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . before they stormed out of the chamber , the npd parliamentarians had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied " bombing holocaust " of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
german politicians have also called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols , which are also outlawed in germany . constitutional court justice winfried hassemer told der spiegel newsmagazine that despite the last botched case against the far-right party , a ban was still " feasible " if the government took care not to repeat the same mistakes .
he said the court 's ruling in 2003 had " nothing to do with the actual unconstitutionality of this party . " encourgaged by justices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high court judges winfried hassemer and hans-jürgen papier .
the highly unusual public comments by justices papier and hassemer have encouraged some politicians to consider a renewed attempt to ban the npd . " we will have to carefully check in the coming weeks whether we can to come to another assessment regarding the npd ban , " dieter wiefelspütz , interior policy spokesman for the social democrats , told the netzeitung online newspaper . but other officials , mindful of the fallout from the last failure , remain cautious about pressing ahead with another case . " there is n't enough evidence against the npd at the moment , " beckstein told the afp news agency .
he said taking the issue to the constitutional court would " not be wise " considering the possibility of another failed ban giving the far-right extremists even more momentum . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : banning the far-right npd politicians in saxony 's state parliament made no bones about their extreme right-wing views by walking out on a commemoration of holocaust victims .

the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace . hans-jürgen papier , president of germany 's highest court , told the bild am sonntag newspaper that it was still possible to outlaw the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- even though an attempt to do so by the federal government in 2003 was rejected by the justices on procedural grounds . " the suspension of proceedings to ban the npd does not represent a predetermined outcome on future efforts to ban it , " papier wrote in the newspaper .
" these facts need to be remembered . " the german constitution allows groups and political parties that are deemed dangerous due to their support for nazism to be banned .
berlin believes the npd qualifies , but the constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's case to ban the party . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high court judges winfried hassemer and hans-jürgen papier .
since then , the party has flourished , particularly in the former communist east of germany , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments .
last september , the neo-nazi outfit shamed germany by winning nearly 10 percent of the vote in a state election in saxony .
the right-wing extremist have made a point of offending the political mainstream ever since . outrage in saxony demands to take action against the party came to a head last week , when the npd deputies in saxony 's parliament refused to take part in a moment of silence for the victims of the nazis during a commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . before they stormed out of the chamber , the npd parliamentarians had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied " bombing holocaust " of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
german politicians have also called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols , which are also outlawed in germany . constitutional court justice winfried hassemer told der spiegel newsmagazine that despite the last botched case against the far-right party , a ban was still " feasible " if the government took care not to repeat the same mistakes .
he said the court 's ruling in 2003 had " nothing to do with the actual unconstitutionality of this party . " encourgaged by justices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high court judges winfried hassemer and hans-jürgen papier .
the highly unusual public comments by justices papier and hassemer have encouraged some politicians to consider a renewed attempt to ban the npd . " we will have to carefully check in the coming weeks whether we can to come to another assessment regarding the npd ban , " dieter wiefelspütz , interior policy spokesman for the social democrats , told the netzeitung online newspaper . but other officials , mindful of the fallout from the last failure , remain cautious about pressing ahead with another case . " there is n't enough evidence against the npd at the moment , " beckstein told the afp news agency .

the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace . hans-jürgen papier , president of germany 's highest court , told the bild am sonntag newspaper that it was still possible to outlaw the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- even though an attempt to do so by the federal government in 2003 was rejected by the justices on procedural grounds . " the suspension of proceedings to ban the npd does not represent a predetermined outcome on future efforts to ban it , " papier wrote in the newspaper .
" these facts need to be remembered . " the german constitution allows groups and political parties that are deemed dangerous due to their support for nazism to be banned .
berlin believes the npd qualifies , but the constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's case to ban the party . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high court judges winfried hassemer and hans-jürgen papier .
since then , the party has flourished , particularly in the former communist east of germany , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments .
last september , the neo-nazi outfit shamed germany by winning nearly 10 percent of the vote in a state election in saxony .
the right-wing extremist have made a point of offending the political mainstream ever since . outrage in saxony demands to take action against the party came to a head last week , when the npd deputies in saxony 's parliament refused to take part in a moment of silence for the victims of the nazis during a commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . before they stormed out of the chamber , the npd parliamentarians had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied " bombing holocaust " of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
german politicians have also called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols , which are also outlawed in germany . constitutional court justice winfried hassemer told der spiegel newsmagazine that despite the last botched case against the far-right party , a ban was still " feasible " if the government took care not to repeat the same mistakes .
he said the court 's ruling in 2003 had " nothing to do with the actual unconstitutionality of this party . " encourgaged by justices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high court judges winfried hassemer and hans-jürgen papier .
the highly unusual public comments by justices papier and hassemer have encouraged some politicians to consider a renewed attempt to ban the npd . " we will have to carefully check in the coming weeks whether we can to come to another assessment regarding the npd ban , " dieter wiefelspütz , interior policy spokesman for the social democrats , told the netzeitung online newspaper . but other officials , mindful of the fallout from the last failure , remain cautious about pressing ahead with another case . " there is n't enough evidence against the npd at the moment , " beckstein told the afp news agency .

the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace . hans-jürgen papier , president of germany 's highest court , told the bild am sonntag newspaper that it was still possible to outlaw the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- even though an attempt to do so by the federal government in 2003 was rejected by the justices on procedural grounds . " the suspension of proceedings to ban the npd does not represent a predetermined outcome on future efforts to ban it , " papier wrote in the newspaper .
" these facts need to be remembered . " the german constitution allows groups and political parties that are deemed dangerous due to their support for nazism to be banned .
berlin believes the npd qualifies , but the constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's case to ban the party . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high court judges winfried hassemer and hans-jürgen papier .
since then , the party has flourished , particularly in the former communist east of germany , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments .
last september , the neo-nazi outfit shamed germany by winning nearly 10 percent of the vote in a state election in saxony .
the right-wing extremist have made a point of offending the political mainstream ever since . outrage in saxony demands to take action against the party came to a head last week , when the npd deputies in saxony 's parliament refused to take part in a moment of silence for the victims of the nazis during a commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . before they stormed out of the chamber , the npd parliamentarians had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied " bombing holocaust " of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
german politicians have also called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols , which are also outlawed in germany . constitutional court justice winfried hassemer told der spiegel newsmagazine that despite the last botched case against the far-right party , a ban was still " feasible " if the government took care not to repeat the same mistakes .
he said the court 's ruling in 2003 had " nothing to do with the actual unconstitutionality of this party . " encourgaged by justices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high court judges winfried hassemer and hans-jürgen papier .
the highly unusual public comments by justices papier and hassemer have encouraged some politicians to consider a renewed attempt to ban the npd . " we will have to carefully check in the coming weeks whether we can to come to another assessment regarding the npd ban , " dieter wiefelspütz , interior policy spokesman for the social democrats , told the netzeitung online newspaper . but other officials , mindful of the fallout from the last failure , remain cautious about pressing ahead with another case . " there is n't enough evidence against the npd at the moment , " beckstein told the afp news agency .

the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace . hans-jürgen papier , president of germany 's highest court , told the bild am sonntag newspaper that it was still possible to outlaw the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- even though an attempt to do so by the federal government in 2003 was rejected by the justices on procedural grounds . " the suspension of proceedings to ban the npd does not represent a predetermined outcome on future efforts to ban it , " papier wrote in the newspaper .
" these facts need to be remembered . " the german constitution allows groups and political parties that are deemed dangerous due to their support for nazism to be banned .
berlin believes the npd qualifies , but the constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's case to ban the party . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high court judges winfried hassemer and hans-jürgen papier .
since then , the party has flourished , particularly in the former communist east of germany , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments .
last september , the neo-nazi outfit shamed germany by winning nearly 10 percent of the vote in a state election in saxony .
the right-wing extremist have made a point of offending the political mainstream ever since . outrage in saxony demands to take action against the party came to a head last week , when the npd deputies in saxony 's parliament refused to take part in a moment of silence for the victims of the nazis during a commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . before they stormed out of the chamber , the npd parliamentarians had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied " bombing holocaust " of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
german politicians have also called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols , which are also outlawed in germany . constitutional court justice winfried hassemer told der spiegel newsmagazine that despite the last botched case against the far-right party , a ban was still " feasible " if the government took care not to repeat the same mistakes .
he said the court 's ruling in 2003 had " nothing to do with the actual unconstitutionality of this party . " encourgaged by justices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high court judges winfried hassemer and hans-jürgen papier .
the highly unusual public comments by justices papier and hassemer have encouraged some politicians to consider a renewed attempt to ban the npd . " we will have to carefully check in the coming weeks whether we can to come to another assessment regarding the npd ban , " dieter wiefelspütz , interior policy spokesman for the social democrats , told the netzeitung online newspaper . but other officials , mindful of the fallout from the last failure , remain cautious about pressing ahead with another case . " there is n't enough evidence against the npd at the moment , " beckstein told the afp news agency .
he said taking the issue to the constitutional court would " not be wise " considering the possibility of another failed ban giving the far-right extremists even more momentum . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : banning the far-right npd politicians in saxony 's state parliament made no bones about their extreme right-wing views by walking out on a commemoration of holocaust victims .

villagers in west hoathly and sharpthorne have been given training in how to use police speed guns and can start using them from monday .
the 22 volunteers , who will patrol the c319 , have also been given tuition in anger management and health and safety .
the speedwatch scheme follows a survey of 3,000 mid sussex residents aimed at finding their policing priorities .
dramatic increase the survey last year found the needs for stronger measures to deal with speeding drivers was the residents ' biggest concern - ranking higher than other crime .
the c319 , which runs through both west hoathly and sharpthorne , has become an unofficial bypass for east grinstead , by linking the a22 and a23 .
police said that even though not marked on maps , the road carries up to 8,000 cars a day and has seen a dramatic increase in road accidents in recent years .
details of vehicles travelling at double the 30mph speed limit will be passed to police to deal with , with the possibility of fines and points on licences .
councillor adrian lithgow , chairman of west hoathly parish council 's traffic committee , said : " because of the demands on police resources , speed limits in country areas are often unenforced .
