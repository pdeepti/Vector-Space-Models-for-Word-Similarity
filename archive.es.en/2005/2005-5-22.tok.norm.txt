" the chancellor and i have given notice that we will seek to hold general elections in the autumn , " müntefering said .
the party would discuss the proposal on monday but the final decision would have to be made by the bundestag lower house of parliament , he added . schröder added that the " bitter defeat " for the spd " throws into question " his ruling coalition 's ability to govern .
he was therefore in favour of holding a general election " in autumn this year " , one year ahead of the scheduled date . north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany with 18 million residents , was the last remaining state governed by a coalition of social democrats and greens , the so-called red-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . the defeat is the latest in a series of poor state election results for schröder 's party .
in 1999 , it governed in 11 of germany 's 16 states but is now in charge of only five . merkel hails sensational victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker kauder , left , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and chairwoman angela merkel , right , cheer in the party 's headquarters in berlin after a press conference following the announcement of exit polls of the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , sunday , may 22 , 2005 .
first exit polls predict a victory of the cdu .
the result is widely viewed as a strong indicator for next year 's national vote .
christian democrat leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schroeder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , hailed the outcome as " sensational " . " the voters have given the christian democratic union a sensational result , they have showed hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of early elections .
" every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " merkel said . new state premier rüttgers looks to fdp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers rüttgers , the cdu 's lead candidate in the state , had capitalized on the high unemployment rate in the heavily industrialized state where 1.1 million people are out of work , just over one fifth of the national total . a series of social security and labor market reforms introduced by schröder 's government have proved deeply unpopular with the spd 's traditional working-class voters .
that was reflected in what , if confirmed , would be its worst state election result in north rhine-westphalia for 51 years . the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , won 6.2 percent with the greens taking 6.0 percent , the exit polls showed . rüttgers said he would begin negotiations with the fdp as soon as possible with a view to forming a ruling coalition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .
-lrb- may 22 , 2005 -rrb- fear and confusion on the campaign trail the north rhine-westphalia state election has been the center of attention for weeks .

however , while following his predecessor 's line so far , questions remain about his own future plans . a month into his pontificate , benedict xvi has confirmed the broad diplomatic and theological lines of his predecessor john paul ii but has left few clues as to how he intends to make his own mark as head of the roman catholic church . once-cardinal joseph ratzinger , known for his conservative stance as the vatican 's guardian of dogma , pope benedict has concentrated since his election on april 19 on reassuring and coming to grips with the church and public opinion before presenting his own vision of the future . " my real program of governance is not to do my own will , not to pursue my own ideas , but to listen , together with the whole church , to the word and the will of the lord , " the 78-year-old benedict xvi said at his inauguration mass . hints at future plans but no concrete action as yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has nonetheless given hints into which issues he plans to address : opening ties with communist china , engaging in ecumenical dialogue , pursuing improved relations with jews and dialogue with islam and other religions . many are now waiting to see whether these initial declarations of intent will turn into concrete action . contacts between the vatican and beijing have multiplied since the death of polish-born john paul ii , but they have been led by the rome-based catholic community of sant 'egidio and will eventually have to be taken over by the diplomats of the holy see .
there are no formal ties between china and the vatican city-state . regarding christian unity , the pope can also benefit from the recent rapprochement between catholic and anglican theologians on marian practices , which have divided the churches for 500 years . but the true test will be whether he is able to improve ties with russia 's orthodox church , which john paul ii was unable to achieve before his death on april 2 . reconciliation work to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emeritus chief rabbi of rome elio toaff is seen greeting pope john paul ii after a concert in the paul vi hall at the vatican , on jan .

german-born benedict xvi has vowed to pursue the work of reconciliation with judaism launched by pope john paul , and plans a historic visit to the synagogue of cologne when he travels to the german city of the world youth days in august . in just a month in office , the pope can already count at least one success : improving his image as a stern vatican watchdog . according to a poll published in italy 's la repubblica daily tuesday , 78 percent of italians have a good opinion of the pope , although they do not expect him to carry out the changes they wish to see in the church 's positions on contraception , abortion and assisted procreation . hard line still in evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new pope has in fact reaffirmed the church 's insistence on the sacred nature of all human life from conception to natural death , calling abortion murder and indicating that the " preservation of life " would be a central theme of his pontificate . he has also underlined the catholic church 's universal vocation to break through the barriers of racism and class divisions and cross the borders between peoples - key themes of the church 's progressive wing . in addressing all these issues , the pope has repeatedly evoked his human fragility as " simple and humble laborer in the vineyard of the lord . " benedict coming to terms with public persona coming after the 26-year rule of charismatic and media-savvy john paul ii , benedict xvi appears to be a reserved man .
although he seems to be relaxing as the weeks go by in his contact with the faithful , vatican observers consider him more of an intellectual pope than outgoing political figure . the pope has distanced himself from more popular forms of piety encouraged by john paul ii , although he seemingly gave in to popular pressure to skip a five-year wait before launching the beatification procedure for pope john paul . contrary to his predecessor , for example , benedict xvi has chosen not to preside over all beatification ceremonies . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de john paul ii on fast track to sainthood pope benedict xvi announced on friday that he had started the process to beatify his predecessor john paul ii , dispensing with rules that require a five-year waiting period before the sainthood procedure can start .

she did n't know anyone on the outside any more . " learning from inmates de cock heard many similar stories during his visits .
in many cases , he was the first person to show any interest in inmates for years , he said . " the more you enter this world , the more you realize that nice things happen there as well , " he said .

"
gracia tries to identify charitable persons unknown germany 's entry in the 50th eurovision song contest finished last with four votes as greece took the crown at the celebration of kitsch in kiev on saturday .
gracia 's song " run and hide " had voters turning off . germany 's eurovision song contest hopes were more than dashed on saturday night ; they were thrown to the floor and stamped on by every stiletto and cuban heel on show at the 50th gala of kitsch in kiev . gracia bauer , a former talent show also-ran who had courted controversy over her involvement in a chart-rigging scandal just weeks before the competition , garnered a woeful four points with her song " run and hide " .
it seemed like the voters took her words as sound advice as germany scored one of its lowest totals in the history of the competition . the dubious accolade of eurovision winner went to greece as singer helena paparizou thrashed the competition , triumphing over contestants from 23 other countries with her song " my number one . "
the news was greeted with scenes of joys in athens , where hundreds of people celebrated on the streets of the greek capital . greece celebrates eurovision victory in athens , paparizou fans , who had watched the contest on a giant screen late saturday in front of the zappeion palace , went wild when the greek victory was announced .
brandishing greek flags , they danced and embraced to the beat of " my number one , " written by christos dantis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " many congratulations to helena , " said athens mayor dora bakoyannis , who was on the scene .
" it 's a unique moment that we deserve ...
athens is ready to welcome eurovision in 2006 . " ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , who attended the songfest with his family , handed paparizou the eurovision award .
yushchenko handed paparizou a golden trophy inspired by jewels crafted by the scythians , an ancient people that once inhabited the territory of present-day ukraine . " this is a ukrainian prize for best european song , for europe 's best singer -lrb- handed -rrb- in the name of a united europe , " yushchenko said after giving paparizou a peck on the cheek . clad in a short golden dress , paparizou , who was born and raised in sweden , gave an energetic performance which included elements of a traditional greek national dance . paparizou , who was elected by television viewers from 39 countries , won with 230 points , 38 points ahead of malta 's chiara , who placed second with the song " angel . "
romania 's luminita anghel and sistem placed third with " let me try . " controversy surrounds ukrainian song bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winner of eurovision 2004 ruslana lyzhychko with viktor yushchenko .
last year 's winner , ukraine 's ruslana , opened the competition with a performance of one of her songs , " fire " . this year 's ukrainian candidate , the greenjolly group , placed only 20th .
its selection to represent the former soviet republic had sparked controversy , as had its choice of song , " razom nas bahato " -lrb- together we are many -rrb- , the hymn sung by demonstrators against former president leonid kuchma 's regime in kiev 's independence square during last year 's " orange revolution . " greenjolly was largely unknown before the revolution and its last minute choice unleashed an avalanche of criticism of the new government which was accused of manipulating the vote that picked the group . to deflect criticism , greenjolly was obliged to modify the lyrics of the song , removing mention of the current president 's name . song contest a political opportunity ukraine 's authorities saw the eurovision contest as a way to showcase the country as 100 percent european , while yushchenko has made no secret of his hope to see kiev eventually join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine president viktor yushchenko has european designs " ukraine has always been a harmonious component of the -lrb- european -rrb- space , " the ukrainian leader said a few days before the songfest began .
" it has been made up not only by politicians , but also by peoples , their common values , their history and their culture .
these days in kiev , you will be able to feel this once more , " yushchenko said . the contest was held under tight security , as some 4,000 police stood by to make sure the 50th edition of the annual kitsch-fest did not get out of hand . before entering kiev 's sports palace , an arena capable of holding an audience of up to 8,000 , spectators had to submit to strict security checks and file under a metal detector . celebration of kitsch goes from strength to strength the eurovision song contest , first held in 1956 , is often associated with music of questionable merit , bizarre costumes and marked political bias in the voting .
yet all these elements have contributed to its enduring popularity . eurovision was a launch pad for the careers of such internationally famous performers as swedish disco group abba in the 1970s , or , later , french canadian singer celine dion , who represented switzerland , where she was living at the time . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politics and kitsch mix at eurovision as ukraine prepares to host this year 's eurovision song contest , it 's keen to present a new face to the world following last year 's " orange revolution .

" the chancellor and i have given notice that we will seek to hold general elections in the autumn , " müntefering said .
the party would discuss the proposal on monday but the final decision would have to be made by the bundestag lower house of parliament , he added . schröder added that the " bitter defeat " for the spd " throws into question " his ruling coalition 's ability to govern .
he was therefore in favour of holding a general election " in autumn this year " , one year ahead of the scheduled date . north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany with 18 million residents , was the last remaining state governed by a coalition of social democrats and greens , the so-called red-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . the defeat is the latest in a series of poor state election results for schröder 's party .
in 1999 , it governed in 11 of germany 's 16 states but is now in charge of only five . merkel hails sensational victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker kauder , left , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and chairwoman angela merkel , right , cheer in the party 's headquarters in berlin after a press conference following the announcement of exit polls of the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , sunday , may 22 , 2005 .
first exit polls predict a victory of the cdu .
the result is widely viewed as a strong indicator for next year 's national vote .
christian democrat leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schroeder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , hailed the outcome as " sensational " . " the voters have given the christian democratic union a sensational result , they have showed hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of early elections .
" every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " merkel said . new state premier rüttgers looks to fdp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers rüttgers , the cdu 's lead candidate in the state , had capitalized on the high unemployment rate in the heavily industrialized state where 1.1 million people are out of work , just over one fifth of the national total . a series of social security and labor market reforms introduced by schröder 's government have proved deeply unpopular with the spd 's traditional working-class voters .
that was reflected in what , if confirmed , would be its worst state election result in north rhine-westphalia for 51 years . the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , won 6.2 percent with the greens taking 6.0 percent , the exit polls showed . rüttgers said he would begin negotiations with the fdp as soon as possible with a view to forming a ruling coalition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .

television polls showed the extent of the defeat , showing the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in front with 45.0 percent , ahead of the spd 's 37.5 percent , and enough to win control of a region schröder 's party has ruled since 1966 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück the sdp 's peer steinbrück will make way as state premier for the conservative candidate jürgen rüttgers once the result has been confirmed . the shockwaves will be felt from the western state all the way to the capital and will surely reverberate through the coming 12 months , shaking schröder 's already faltering leadership ahead of the general election .
the loss of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is an indication that schröder 's hoped for a third term is looking increasingly less likely . in contrast , the result is likely to boost the chances that cdu leader angela merkel will run against schröder in 2006 , raising the prospect of germany 's first woman chancellor . a desperate shift to the left on the cards ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the likely policy change as a result of the defeat could see the sdp move further over to the left in a bid to win back traditional voters that abandoned them in nrw .
the left-wing of the party , which opposed the chancellor 's welfare reforms , has been clamoring for a return to more traditional worker-friendly policies and may get that swing on the back of the result on sunday . but the defeat may have more far-reaching consequences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.05.2005 spd considers early election after defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader franz müntefering announces a possible early election the leadership of germany 's social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- met shortly after the damaging defeat in north rhine-westphalia and emerged soon after to declare it was considering calling an early federal election . german chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrats lost control of a key state on sunday , according to exit polls , and then proposed moving the general election forward to this year . the polls showed the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- suffered a heavy defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia where it had ruled for 39 years . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won 45 percent , comfortably ahead of the 37.2 percent for the spd , public tv said , shortly after polling stations closed . bitter defeat leads to emergency discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering spd chairman franz müntefering said it was a " bitter defeat " and immediately announced that his party would propose holding a general election late this year , around 12 months ahead of the scheduled date of september 2006 . " the chancellor and i have given notice that we will seek to hold general elections in the autumn , " müntefering said .
the party would discuss the proposal on monday but the final decision would have to be made by the bundestag lower house of parliament , he added . schröder added that the " bitter defeat " for the spd " throws into question " his ruling coalition 's ability to govern .
he was therefore in favour of holding a general election " in autumn this year " , one year ahead of the scheduled date . north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany with 18 million residents , was the last remaining state governed by a coalition of social democrats and greens , the so-called red-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . the defeat is the latest in a series of poor state election results for schröder 's party .
in 1999 , it governed in 11 of germany 's 16 states but is now in charge of only five . merkel hails sensational victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker kauder , left , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and chairwoman angela merkel , right , cheer in the party 's headquarters in berlin after a press conference following the announcement of exit polls of the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , sunday , may 22 , 2005 .
first exit polls predict a victory of the cdu .
the result is widely viewed as a strong indicator for next year 's national vote .
christian democrat leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schroeder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , hailed the outcome as " sensational " . " the voters have given the christian democratic union a sensational result , they have showed hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of early elections .
" every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " merkel said . new state premier rüttgers looks to fdp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers rüttgers , the cdu 's lead candidate in the state , had capitalized on the high unemployment rate in the heavily industrialized state where 1.1 million people are out of work , just over one fifth of the national total . a series of social security and labor market reforms introduced by schröder 's government have proved deeply unpopular with the spd 's traditional working-class voters .
that was reflected in what , if confirmed , would be its worst state election result in north rhine-westphalia for 51 years . the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , won 6.2 percent with the greens taking 6.0 percent , the exit polls showed . rüttgers said he would begin negotiations with the fdp as soon as possible with a view to forming a ruling coalition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .

" it 's wholly justified .
if we did not get the result we wanted we would not hesitate to use our veto , " the finance minister told bbc television . the british government rejects the eu proposals to freeze the annual budget rebate in 2007 and ultimately reduce it , arguing that it receives far less agricultural and regional development funding than its european counterparts . " it is the right thing to do because we get so little of the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- receipts , we get so little of the structural and cohesion funds receipts , that our rebate is wholly justified , " brown said . " i was at a meeting last saturday and made it absolutely clear that our rebate was wholly justified , " brown added , referring to the eu talks in luxembourg .
" jack straw is going -lrb- to the meeting in brussels -rrb- and he will make that absolutely clear as well . " straw to fight " unfairly high " demands straw said previously in march that his government was ready to use its veto to retain the long-cherished rebate - worth some three billion pounds -lrb- $ 5.5 billion , 4.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . the eu subsidies system has been modernized hugely since the rebate was first granted in 1984 - but london insists britain 's contribution to brussels would still be unfairly high without it . " the reason is because france , for example , is getting high amounts of agricultural subsidies receipts .
we do n't , " brown added .
" which means that without the rebate , there would be a gap which would mean that we would be paying far more than france , far more than italy , far more than other countries .

" the presidency has done its work so well that technically it would not be very difficult to reach an agreement , " a french diplomat said .
" the real problem is the british rebate , " he added .
the french diplomat said that the problem was that successive british governments had lived on the rebate for 20 years and that the british were unlikely to budge .

" if we want to get a political agreement , everybody around the table has to make sacrifices , but sacrifices that they can justify , " a luxembourg source said . the battle lines over the overall eu 's budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 are roughly drawn between the european commission which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . commission pushing for increased contributions luxembourg has proposed an overall budget for the eu in a range from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.085 trillion - $ 1.129 trillion -rrb- , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gross national income . the commission is angling for an eu budget of one trillion euros while the six main contributors have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gni . while putting the british rebate into question , the luxembourg proposals suggest that germany , the netherlands and sweden - the biggest contributors to the eu 's budget - should benefit from " specific measures " . taking a leaf out of margaret thatcher 's book , luxembourg proposals said such measures were justified because " no member state should sustain a budgetary burden which is excessive in relation to its relative prosperity " .

if we did not get the result we wanted we would not hesitate to use our veto , " the finance minister told bbc television . the british government rejects the eu proposals to freeze the annual budget rebate in 2007 and ultimately reduce it , arguing that it receives far less agricultural and regional development funding than its european counterparts . " it is the right thing to do because we get so little of the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- receipts , we get so little of the structural and cohesion funds receipts , that our rebate is wholly justified , " brown said . " i was at a meeting last saturday and made it absolutely clear that our rebate was wholly justified , " brown added , referring to the eu talks in luxembourg .
" jack straw is going -lrb- to the meeting in brussels -rrb- and he will make that absolutely clear as well . " straw to fight " unfairly high " demands straw said previously in march that his government was ready to use its veto to retain the long-cherished rebate - worth some three billion pounds -lrb- $ 5.5 billion , 4.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . the eu subsidies system has been modernized hugely since the rebate was first granted in 1984 - but london insists britain 's contribution to brussels would still be unfairly high without it . " the reason is because france , for example , is getting high amounts of agricultural subsidies receipts .
we do n't , " brown added .
" which means that without the rebate , there would be a gap which would mean that we would be paying far more than france , far more than italy , far more than other countries . " rebate preventing breakthrough on eu budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu finance ministers have been wrangling over the budget for months other brussels diplomats said that if it were not for the issue of britain 's rebate , the proposals by the luxembourg presidency could probably break a deadlock over the overall eu budget . " the presidency has done its work so well that technically it would not be very difficult to reach an agreement , " a french diplomat said .
" the real problem is the british rebate , " he added .
the french diplomat said that the problem was that successive british governments had lived on the rebate for 20 years and that the british were unlikely to budge .
for the british , " there is the crown and the check " he said . eu wants budget sorted before britain 's presidency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg , a veteran broker in eu affairs , wants an agreement to be struck at a summit in brussles of eu leaders on june 16 and 17 because otherwise the budget likely will languish once britain takes over the eu 's rotating presidency for six months in july . " if we want to get a political agreement , everybody around the table has to make sacrifices , but sacrifices that they can justify , " a luxembourg source said . the battle lines over the overall eu 's budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 are roughly drawn between the european commission which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . commission pushing for increased contributions luxembourg has proposed an overall budget for the eu in a range from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.085 trillion - $ 1.129 trillion -rrb- , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gross national income . the commission is angling for an eu budget of one trillion euros while the six main contributors have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gni . while putting the british rebate into question , the luxembourg proposals suggest that germany , the netherlands and sweden - the biggest contributors to the eu 's budget - should benefit from " specific measures " . taking a leaf out of margaret thatcher 's book , luxembourg proposals said such measures were justified because " no member state should sustain a budgetary burden which is excessive in relation to its relative prosperity " .
that was the same grounds thatcher originally based her argument for the rebate . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain protests eu budget plans british officials have labelled eu budget plans which would see britain 's € 4 billion rebate scrapped " unfair " after the european commission revealed the proposals for spending between 2007 and 2013 .

however , the islamic state is calling the summit " europe 's last chance " . the european union will try to coax iran back from the nuclear brink this week , warning tehran it could be hauled before the un security council if it carries out a threat to resume key atomic activities . the islamic state - suspected by the united states of wanting to build atomic weapons - is calling the meeting " the last chance for the europeans " to come up with something worth bargaining for . but the pressure on iran is multiplied by washington , waiting to direct its diplomatic fire straight at tehran if the eu talks fail .
" the bar for iran must be set very high because of its history of deception " in years of concealing its nuclear program , said nicholas burns , us under secretary for political affairs , last week . the talks will bring together iran 's top nuclear negotiators with the so-called eu-3 - the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , along with eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the exact timing and location of the talks is unclear , but diplomats say the most likely is a meeting of senior officials in brussels on tuesday before the full ministerial talks on wednesday in geneva . enrichment resumed after halt after suspending nuclear activities late last year , tehran recently said that it intends to resume some of the work it brought to a halt under an agreement reached with britain , france and germany last november . but tehran insists its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including enriching uranium , is aimed at generating electricity and is a right for a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . with tensions mounting , iranian negotiator hossein moussavian has raised the rhetoric to new levels .
he said last week that if the talks fail , uranium conversion work - a precursor to enrichment - being carried out at a plant near the central city of isfahan could restart before the presidential election on june 17 .
" the decision on resuming activities at isfahan is irreversible , " he said . carrot and stick approach ineffective so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dealing with iran 's clerical regime , the eu has held the carrot ; offering trade , security and technological incentives .
in the background , the united states has wielded the stick , leaving " all options on the table " although its more overt threats of the past have receded recently . in its letter on may 11 inviting iran back to the negotiating table , the eu warned the regime it could be heading into dangerous , uncharted territory .
" it would bring the negotiating process to an end .
the consequences beyond could only be negative for iran , " the letter from the eu three britain , france and germany read . europeans ponder vital next move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohsen mirdamadi , right , a reformist and who heads the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs and national security , talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , at iran 's parliament building in tehran .
despite these options , diplomats believe there is little room for maneuver .
" the europeans could try to put a bit more on the table , but they will not go back on their core demand , a halt in enrichment .
they have an agreement on this with the americans , and can not afford to go back , " said one . if iran resumes its suspended nuclear activities , the matter is likely to go first to the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog . from there , it would be sent to the un security council - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
given the need for consensus , with nations like russia and china , the council may just issue a warning . is stand-off an election tactic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a savvy pragmatist who has attempted to make contacts with the united states in the past , attends a press conference , after registering as a presidential candidate at the interior ministry in tehran , iran , wednesday , may 11 , 2005 .
iran 's presidential election will take place june 17 .
the unknown factor is how much the tensions can be put down to iranian electioneering .
amid the preparations for next month 's presidential poll , state television is running announcements selling the benefits of nuclear power to the public . according to dr ali ansari , at britain 's royal institute of international affairs , the regime has to appear tough before the poll .

however , the islamic state is calling the summit " europe 's last chance " . the european union will try to coax iran back from the nuclear brink this week , warning tehran it could be hauled before the un security council if it carries out a threat to resume key atomic activities . the islamic state - suspected by the united states of wanting to build atomic weapons - is calling the meeting " the last chance for the europeans " to come up with something worth bargaining for . but the pressure on iran is multiplied by washington , waiting to direct its diplomatic fire straight at tehran if the eu talks fail .
" the bar for iran must be set very high because of its history of deception " in years of concealing its nuclear program , said nicholas burns , us under secretary for political affairs , last week . the talks will bring together iran 's top nuclear negotiators with the so-called eu-3 - the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , along with eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the exact timing and location of the talks is unclear , but diplomats say the most likely is a meeting of senior officials in brussels on tuesday before the full ministerial talks on wednesday in geneva . enrichment resumed after halt after suspending nuclear activities late last year , tehran recently said that it intends to resume some of the work it brought to a halt under an agreement reached with britain , france and germany last november . but tehran insists its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including enriching uranium , is aimed at generating electricity and is a right for a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . with tensions mounting , iranian negotiator hossein moussavian has raised the rhetoric to new levels .
he said last week that if the talks fail , uranium conversion work - a precursor to enrichment - being carried out at a plant near the central city of isfahan could restart before the presidential election on june 17 .
" the decision on resuming activities at isfahan is irreversible , " he said . carrot and stick approach ineffective so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dealing with iran 's clerical regime , the eu has held the carrot ; offering trade , security and technological incentives .
in the background , the united states has wielded the stick , leaving " all options on the table " although its more overt threats of the past have receded recently . in its letter on may 11 inviting iran back to the negotiating table , the eu warned the regime it could be heading into dangerous , uncharted territory .
" it would bring the negotiating process to an end .
the consequences beyond could only be negative for iran , " the letter from the eu three britain , france and germany read . europeans ponder vital next move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohsen mirdamadi , right , a reformist and who heads the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs and national security , talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , at iran 's parliament building in tehran .
despite these options , diplomats believe there is little room for maneuver .
" the europeans could try to put a bit more on the table , but they will not go back on their core demand , a halt in enrichment .
they have an agreement on this with the americans , and can not afford to go back , " said one . if iran resumes its suspended nuclear activities , the matter is likely to go first to the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog . from there , it would be sent to the un security council - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
given the need for consensus , with nations like russia and china , the council may just issue a warning . is stand-off an election tactic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a savvy pragmatist who has attempted to make contacts with the united states in the past , attends a press conference , after registering as a presidential candidate at the interior ministry in tehran , iran , wednesday , may 11 , 2005 .
iran 's presidential election will take place june 17 .
the unknown factor is how much the tensions can be put down to iranian electioneering .
amid the preparations for next month 's presidential poll , state television is running announcements selling the benefits of nuclear power to the public . according to dr ali ansari , at britain 's royal institute of international affairs , the regime has to appear tough before the poll .

"
gracia tries to identify charitable persons unknown germany 's entry in the 50th eurovision song contest finished last with four votes as greece took the crown at the celebration of kitsch in kiev on saturday .
gracia 's song " run and hide " had voters turning off . germany 's eurovision song contest hopes were more than dashed on saturday night ; they were thrown to the floor and stamped on by every stiletto and cuban heel on show at the 50th gala of kitsch in kiev . gracia bauer , a former talent show also-ran who had courted controversy over her involvement in a chart-rigging scandal just weeks before the competition , garnered a woeful four points with her song " run and hide " .
it seemed like the voters took her words as sound advice as germany scored one of its lowest totals in the history of the competition . the dubious accolade of eurovision winner went to greece as singer helena paparizou thrashed the competition , triumphing over contestants from 23 other countries with her song " my number one . "
the news was greeted with scenes of joys in athens , where hundreds of people celebrated on the streets of the greek capital . greece celebrates eurovision victory in athens , paparizou fans , who had watched the contest on a giant screen late saturday in front of the zappeion palace , went wild when the greek victory was announced .
brandishing greek flags , they danced and embraced to the beat of " my number one , " written by christos dantis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " many congratulations to helena , " said athens mayor dora bakoyannis , who was on the scene .
" it 's a unique moment that we deserve ...
athens is ready to welcome eurovision in 2006 . " ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , who attended the songfest with his family , handed paparizou the eurovision award .
yushchenko handed paparizou a golden trophy inspired by jewels crafted by the scythians , an ancient people that once inhabited the territory of present-day ukraine . " this is a ukrainian prize for best european song , for europe 's best singer -lrb- handed -rrb- in the name of a united europe , " yushchenko said after giving paparizou a peck on the cheek . clad in a short golden dress , paparizou , who was born and raised in sweden , gave an energetic performance which included elements of a traditional greek national dance . paparizou , who was elected by television viewers from 39 countries , won with 230 points , 38 points ahead of malta 's chiara , who placed second with the song " angel . "

last year 's winner , ukraine 's ruslana , opened the competition with a performance of one of her songs , " fire " . this year 's ukrainian candidate , the greenjolly group , placed only 20th .
its selection to represent the former soviet republic had sparked controversy , as had its choice of song , " razom nas bahato " -lrb- together we are many -rrb- , the hymn sung by demonstrators against former president leonid kuchma 's regime in kiev 's independence square during last year 's " orange revolution . " greenjolly was largely unknown before the revolution and its last minute choice unleashed an avalanche of criticism of the new government which was accused of manipulating the vote that picked the group . to deflect criticism , greenjolly was obliged to modify the lyrics of the song , removing mention of the current president 's name . song contest a political opportunity ukraine 's authorities saw the eurovision contest as a way to showcase the country as 100 percent european , while yushchenko has made no secret of his hope to see kiev eventually join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine president viktor yushchenko has european designs " ukraine has always been a harmonious component of the -lrb- european -rrb- space , " the ukrainian leader said a few days before the songfest began .
" it has been made up not only by politicians , but also by peoples , their common values , their history and their culture .
these days in kiev , you will be able to feel this once more , " yushchenko said . the contest was held under tight security , as some 4,000 police stood by to make sure the 50th edition of the annual kitsch-fest did not get out of hand . before entering kiev 's sports palace , an arena capable of holding an audience of up to 8,000 , spectators had to submit to strict security checks and file under a metal detector . celebration of kitsch goes from strength to strength the eurovision song contest , first held in 1956 , is often associated with music of questionable merit , bizarre costumes and marked political bias in the voting .
yet all these elements have contributed to its enduring popularity . eurovision was a launch pad for the careers of such internationally famous performers as swedish disco group abba in the 1970s , or , later , french canadian singer celine dion , who represented switzerland , where she was living at the time . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politics and kitsch mix at eurovision as ukraine prepares to host this year 's eurovision song contest , it 's keen to present a new face to the world following last year 's " orange revolution .

" the chancellor and i have given notice that we will seek to hold general elections in the autumn , " müntefering said .
the party would discuss the proposal on monday but the final decision would have to be made by the bundestag lower house of parliament , he added . schröder added that the " bitter defeat " for the spd " throws into question " his ruling coalition 's ability to govern .
he was therefore in favour of holding a general election " in autumn this year " , one year ahead of the scheduled date . north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany with 18 million residents , was the last remaining state governed by a coalition of social democrats and greens , the so-called red-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . the defeat is the latest in a series of poor state election results for schröder 's party .
in 1999 , it governed in 11 of germany 's 16 states but is now in charge of only five . merkel hails sensational victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker kauder , left , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and chairwoman angela merkel , right , cheer in the party 's headquarters in berlin after a press conference following the announcement of exit polls of the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , sunday , may 22 , 2005 .
first exit polls predict a victory of the cdu .
the result is widely viewed as a strong indicator for next year 's national vote .
christian democrat leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schroeder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , hailed the outcome as " sensational " . " the voters have given the christian democratic union a sensational result , they have showed hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of early elections .
" every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " merkel said . new state premier rüttgers looks to fdp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers rüttgers , the cdu 's lead candidate in the state , had capitalized on the high unemployment rate in the heavily industrialized state where 1.1 million people are out of work , just over one fifth of the national total . a series of social security and labor market reforms introduced by schröder 's government have proved deeply unpopular with the spd 's traditional working-class voters .
that was reflected in what , if confirmed , would be its worst state election result in north rhine-westphalia for 51 years . the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , won 6.2 percent with the greens taking 6.0 percent , the exit polls showed . rüttgers said he would begin negotiations with the fdp as soon as possible with a view to forming a ruling coalition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .

an spd defeat would be bad news for the government ahead of the general election in 2006 . germany 's social democrats have their backs to the wall ahead of a key weekend election in a state they have held for nearly four decades , which could spell the beginning of the end for the government of chancellor gerhard schröder . schröder made a passionate plea to voters on friday to back his social democrats and their green coalition partners in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state with 18 million people . opinion polls show the social democrats are set to lose control of the state in sunday 's vote , after 39 years in charge - as disgruntled voters alarmed over a steady loss of jobs and erosion of social benefits head in droves to the opposition . defeat could spell bad omen for 2006 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder be walking away come 2006 ?
the state which forms the industrial heartland of germany appears almost certain to elect the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , an ominous sign for schröder as a general election looms in september 2006 .
defeat in the social democrat stronghold of 13.3 million voters would complete a miserable series of state election results for the chancellor . in 1999 , the spd governed in 11 of germany 's 16 regions but if it loses on sunday it will be in charge of only five . north rhine-westphalia is the only state ruled by a social democrat-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . schröder pleads with nrw for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , schröder told party supporters in dortmund that the state must stay loyal to its traditional politics .
" social democracy is the trademark of north rhine-westphalia and it must remain that way , " the chancellor said , flanked by spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero who had come to lend his support .
the federal government " needs the support of north rhine-westphalia , " schröder said , praising the state for its " social cohesion " . concerning the social security and labor market reforms that have improved competitiveness but swelled unemployment to 1.1 million in this region of coalmines and steelworks , schröder said they were a bitter pill germany must swallow .
" we must complete the overhaul of our social state , " he said .
" if we do not solve these problems we have no chance of staying among the top nations in the world . " unemployment has soared to around five million nationally and north rhine-westphalia has been particularly hard hit where in some areas close to one-quarter of the work force is jobless .
thirty years ago , coal and steel accounted for 830,000 jobs in the state , but now the figure is just 130,000 and as a result , unemployment in the most blighted areas is twice as high as the state average of 12 percent . opposition lead looks conclusive , says poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's jürgen rüttgers and his wife angelika on the campaign trail the conservative cdu is credited with 44 percent of the vote in north rhine-westphalia , ahead of the social democrats with 25 percent , the greens with nine percent and the liberal free democrats ' seven percent , according to a poll released by zdf public television . however the current state premier , peer steinbrueck , enjoys a high approval rating - 52 percent would back him if he were standing for direct election , against 30 percent for his conservative rival jürgen rüttgers , according to a poll published by ard public television . spd pins hopes on " undecided " voters steinbrueck , who admits on his campaign poster that he " can not promise jobs " , conceded on friday that " nationally , the overall trend is strongly against the spd " , but pointed to the large number of undecided voters as proof that the race was far from over . however , even if it takes north-rhine westphalia , the cdu will still lack the two-thirds majority in the federal upper chamber , or bundesrat , that would enable it to block the government 's decisions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear and confusion on the campaign trail the north rhine-westphalia state election has been the center of attention for weeks .

" this is a ukrainian prize for best european song , for europe 's best singer -lrb- handed -rrb- in the name of a united europe , " yushchenko said after giving paparizou a peck on the cheek . clad in a short golden dress , paparizou , who was born and raised in sweden , gave an energetic performance which included elements of a traditional greek national dance . paparizou , who was elected by television viewers from 39 countries , won with 230 points , 38 points ahead of malta 's chiara , who placed second with the song " angel . "
romania 's luminita anghel and sistem placed third with " let me try . " controversy surrounds ukrainian song bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winner of eurovision 2004 ruslana lyzhychko with viktor yushchenko .
last year 's winner , ukraine 's ruslana , opened the competition with a performance of one of her songs , " fire " . this year 's ukrainian candidate , the greenjolly group , placed only 20th .
its selection to represent the former soviet republic had sparked controversy , as had its choice of song , " razom nas bahato " -lrb- together we are many -rrb- , the hymn sung by demonstrators against former president leonid kuchma 's regime in kiev 's independence square during last year 's " orange revolution . " greenjolly was largely unknown before the revolution and its last minute choice unleashed an avalanche of criticism of the new government which was accused of manipulating the vote that picked the group . to deflect criticism , greenjolly was obliged to modify the lyrics of the song , removing mention of the current president 's name . song contest a political opportunity ukraine 's authorities saw the eurovision contest as a way to showcase the country as 100 percent european , while yushchenko has made no secret of his hope to see kiev eventually join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine president viktor yushchenko has european designs " ukraine has always been a harmonious component of the -lrb- european -rrb- space , " the ukrainian leader said a few days before the songfest began .
" it has been made up not only by politicians , but also by peoples , their common values , their history and their culture .
these days in kiev , you will be able to feel this once more , " yushchenko said . the contest was held under tight security , as some 4,000 police stood by to make sure the 50th edition of the annual kitsch-fest did not get out of hand . before entering kiev 's sports palace , an arena capable of holding an audience of up to 8,000 , spectators had to submit to strict security checks and file under a metal detector . celebration of kitsch goes from strength to strength the eurovision song contest , first held in 1956 , is often associated with music of questionable merit , bizarre costumes and marked political bias in the voting .
yet all these elements have contributed to its enduring popularity . eurovision was a launch pad for the careers of such internationally famous performers as swedish disco group abba in the 1970s , or , later , french canadian singer celine dion , who represented switzerland , where she was living at the time . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politics and kitsch mix at eurovision as ukraine prepares to host this year 's eurovision song contest , it 's keen to present a new face to the world following last year 's " orange revolution .

traveling around the globe for a year and visiting 60 countries along the way might be a dream for many .
but the " hotels " jan de cock stayed at during his trip would surely deter most people : prisons . spending time in an overcrowded african prison is not something to aspire to .
but for de cock , it was an experience he had dreamt about for a long time . for the past 20 years , the belgian has been interested in the fate of prisoners , who are often forgotten by the rest of society . " let me make clear that i 'm for justice and for punishing criminals , " he said .
" but it 's not my right to condemn these men and women , these teenagers and children a second or third time .
i want to show these people in a different light .
they 're people just like us . " it was n't easy for de cock to convince officials to let him stay in a prison for a few days and nights just like regular inmates .
it took him three years and hundreds of letters to embassies , ministries and prison directors to prepare for the journey . sleeping with rats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners inside a prison in cotnonou , benin in the end , he received permission to stay at 66 prisons around the globe - some in democratic countries , others run by dictatorial regimes . " the first prison i slept at was in kigali in ruwanda , " he said , adding that the prison , which was built for 2,000 inmates , housed 7,000 people . " i was wedged between fellow inmates , " he said .
" below the beds , where i keep my slippers at home , lay three or four more prisoners .
i remember that i woke up in the middle of the night because something was crawling through my hair .
it was my first encounter with a giant rat . " choosing benin over us de cock said he does believe that prisons reflect a country 's political system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates in a privately-run prison in nevada " you can tell the level of democracy that exists in a country by the way prisoners are dealt with , " he said , adding that democracies do n't always treat their prisoners more humanely . " if you 'd present me with a choice to stay in a clean prison in the us or under miserable conditions as is the case in -lrb- benin 's -rrb- coutonou prison , where 250 people share a room built for 50 , i think i 'd choose the latter , " he said .
" people keep each other alive if they can be together , even if the situation is horrible . " similarities despite regional differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isolation is the worst kind of punishment , de cock said , adding that japan is especially harsh with prisoners .
there , inmates are told in which position they have to sleep .
they are not allowed to talk .
they must n't look guards in the eye . scandinavian prisons on the other hand try to prepare prisoners for their re-entry into society .
in latin america , de cock was surprised by the extreme corruption that exists in prisons there . but despite regional differences , prisoners resemble each other in many ways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners in a cell at moscow 's 18th-century butyrka prison " the thing that hit me most was the extreme sense of abandonment felt by these people , " he said .
" i remember the case of a women in a prison in peru , lima .
when she was released after 27 years behind bars , she came back three days later and begged to be readmitted .
she did n't know anyone on the outside any more . " learning from inmates de cock heard many similar stories during his visits .
in many cases , he was the first person to show any interest in inmates for years , he said . " the more you enter this world , the more you realize that nice things happen there as well , " he said .
" you realize that these people that have been condemned by society can teach us something as well - about trust , about patience and solidarity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates at guantanamo bay prison trying to share his experiences with others , de cock has written a book , " hotel prison , " about his book .
he 's also planning to continue his journey , he said .
" i 'd like to take a look at guantanamo bay , " he said , adding that iraq 's abu ghraib prison is also on his list . christiane wolters -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's graying gangsters criminality among german senior citizens is on the rise .

" the chancellor and i have given notice that we will seek to hold general elections in the autumn , " müntefering said .
the party would discuss the proposal on monday but the final decision would have to be made by the bundestag lower house of parliament , he added . schröder added that the " bitter defeat " for the spd " throws into question " his ruling coalition 's ability to govern .
he was therefore in favour of holding a general election " in autumn this year " , one year ahead of the scheduled date . north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany with 18 million residents , was the last remaining state governed by a coalition of social democrats and greens , the so-called red-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . the defeat is the latest in a series of poor state election results for schröder 's party .
in 1999 , it governed in 11 of germany 's 16 states but is now in charge of only five . merkel hails sensational victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker kauder , left , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and chairwoman angela merkel , right , cheer in the party 's headquarters in berlin after a press conference following the announcement of exit polls of the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , sunday , may 22 , 2005 .
first exit polls predict a victory of the cdu .
the result is widely viewed as a strong indicator for next year 's national vote .
christian democrat leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schroeder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , hailed the outcome as " sensational " . " the voters have given the christian democratic union a sensational result , they have showed hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of early elections .
" every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " merkel said . new state premier rüttgers looks to fdp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers rüttgers , the cdu 's lead candidate in the state , had capitalized on the high unemployment rate in the heavily industrialized state where 1.1 million people are out of work , just over one fifth of the national total . a series of social security and labor market reforms introduced by schröder 's government have proved deeply unpopular with the spd 's traditional working-class voters .
that was reflected in what , if confirmed , would be its worst state election result in north rhine-westphalia for 51 years . the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , won 6.2 percent with the greens taking 6.0 percent , the exit polls showed . rüttgers said he would begin negotiations with the fdp as soon as possible with a view to forming a ruling coalition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .

an spd defeat would be bad news for the government ahead of the general election in 2006 . germany 's social democrats have their backs to the wall ahead of a key weekend election in a state they have held for nearly four decades , which could spell the beginning of the end for the government of chancellor gerhard schröder . schröder made a passionate plea to voters on friday to back his social democrats and their green coalition partners in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state with 18 million people . opinion polls show the social democrats are set to lose control of the state in sunday 's vote , after 39 years in charge - as disgruntled voters alarmed over a steady loss of jobs and erosion of social benefits head in droves to the opposition . defeat could spell bad omen for 2006 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder be walking away come 2006 ?

" social democracy is the trademark of north rhine-westphalia and it must remain that way , " the chancellor said , flanked by spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero who had come to lend his support .
the federal government " needs the support of north rhine-westphalia , " schröder said , praising the state for its " social cohesion " . concerning the social security and labor market reforms that have improved competitiveness but swelled unemployment to 1.1 million in this region of coalmines and steelworks , schröder said they were a bitter pill germany must swallow .
" we must complete the overhaul of our social state , " he said .
" if we do not solve these problems we have no chance of staying among the top nations in the world . " unemployment has soared to around five million nationally and north rhine-westphalia has been particularly hard hit where in some areas close to one-quarter of the work force is jobless .
thirty years ago , coal and steel accounted for 830,000 jobs in the state , but now the figure is just 130,000 and as a result , unemployment in the most blighted areas is twice as high as the state average of 12 percent . opposition lead looks conclusive , says poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's jürgen rüttgers and his wife angelika on the campaign trail the conservative cdu is credited with 44 percent of the vote in north rhine-westphalia , ahead of the social democrats with 25 percent , the greens with nine percent and the liberal free democrats ' seven percent , according to a poll released by zdf public television . however the current state premier , peer steinbrueck , enjoys a high approval rating - 52 percent would back him if he were standing for direct election , against 30 percent for his conservative rival jürgen rüttgers , according to a poll published by ard public television . spd pins hopes on " undecided " voters steinbrueck , who admits on his campaign poster that he " can not promise jobs " , conceded on friday that " nationally , the overall trend is strongly against the spd " , but pointed to the large number of undecided voters as proof that the race was far from over . however , even if it takes north-rhine westphalia , the cdu will still lack the two-thirds majority in the federal upper chamber , or bundesrat , that would enable it to block the government 's decisions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear and confusion on the campaign trail the north rhine-westphalia state election has been the center of attention for weeks .

"
gracia tries to identify charitable persons unknown germany 's entry in the 50th eurovision song contest finished last with four votes as greece took the crown at the celebration of kitsch in kiev on saturday .
gracia 's song " run and hide " had voters turning off . germany 's eurovision song contest hopes were more than dashed on saturday night ; they were thrown to the floor and stamped on by every stiletto and cuban heel on show at the 50th gala of kitsch in kiev . gracia bauer , a former talent show also-ran who had courted controversy over her involvement in a chart-rigging scandal just weeks before the competition , garnered a woeful four points with her song " run and hide " .
it seemed like the voters took her words as sound advice as germany scored one of its lowest totals in the history of the competition . the dubious accolade of eurovision winner went to greece as singer helena paparizou thrashed the competition , triumphing over contestants from 23 other countries with her song " my number one . "
the news was greeted with scenes of joys in athens , where hundreds of people celebrated on the streets of the greek capital . greece celebrates eurovision victory in athens , paparizou fans , who had watched the contest on a giant screen late saturday in front of the zappeion palace , went wild when the greek victory was announced .
brandishing greek flags , they danced and embraced to the beat of " my number one , " written by christos dantis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " many congratulations to helena , " said athens mayor dora bakoyannis , who was on the scene .
" it 's a unique moment that we deserve ...
athens is ready to welcome eurovision in 2006 . " ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , who attended the songfest with his family , handed paparizou the eurovision award .
yushchenko handed paparizou a golden trophy inspired by jewels crafted by the scythians , an ancient people that once inhabited the territory of present-day ukraine . " this is a ukrainian prize for best european song , for europe 's best singer -lrb- handed -rrb- in the name of a united europe , " yushchenko said after giving paparizou a peck on the cheek . clad in a short golden dress , paparizou , who was born and raised in sweden , gave an energetic performance which included elements of a traditional greek national dance . paparizou , who was elected by television viewers from 39 countries , won with 230 points , 38 points ahead of malta 's chiara , who placed second with the song " angel . "
romania 's luminita anghel and sistem placed third with " let me try . " controversy surrounds ukrainian song bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winner of eurovision 2004 ruslana lyzhychko with viktor yushchenko .
last year 's winner , ukraine 's ruslana , opened the competition with a performance of one of her songs , " fire " . this year 's ukrainian candidate , the greenjolly group , placed only 20th .
its selection to represent the former soviet republic had sparked controversy , as had its choice of song , " razom nas bahato " -lrb- together we are many -rrb- , the hymn sung by demonstrators against former president leonid kuchma 's regime in kiev 's independence square during last year 's " orange revolution . " greenjolly was largely unknown before the revolution and its last minute choice unleashed an avalanche of criticism of the new government which was accused of manipulating the vote that picked the group . to deflect criticism , greenjolly was obliged to modify the lyrics of the song , removing mention of the current president 's name . song contest a political opportunity ukraine 's authorities saw the eurovision contest as a way to showcase the country as 100 percent european , while yushchenko has made no secret of his hope to see kiev eventually join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine president viktor yushchenko has european designs " ukraine has always been a harmonious component of the -lrb- european -rrb- space , " the ukrainian leader said a few days before the songfest began .
" it has been made up not only by politicians , but also by peoples , their common values , their history and their culture .
these days in kiev , you will be able to feel this once more , " yushchenko said . the contest was held under tight security , as some 4,000 police stood by to make sure the 50th edition of the annual kitsch-fest did not get out of hand . before entering kiev 's sports palace , an arena capable of holding an audience of up to 8,000 , spectators had to submit to strict security checks and file under a metal detector . celebration of kitsch goes from strength to strength the eurovision song contest , first held in 1956 , is often associated with music of questionable merit , bizarre costumes and marked political bias in the voting .
yet all these elements have contributed to its enduring popularity . eurovision was a launch pad for the careers of such internationally famous performers as swedish disco group abba in the 1970s , or , later , french canadian singer celine dion , who represented switzerland , where she was living at the time . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politics and kitsch mix at eurovision as ukraine prepares to host this year 's eurovision song contest , it 's keen to present a new face to the world following last year 's " orange revolution .

however , the islamic state is calling the summit " europe 's last chance " . the european union will try to coax iran back from the nuclear brink this week , warning tehran it could be hauled before the un security council if it carries out a threat to resume key atomic activities . the islamic state - suspected by the united states of wanting to build atomic weapons - is calling the meeting " the last chance for the europeans " to come up with something worth bargaining for . but the pressure on iran is multiplied by washington , waiting to direct its diplomatic fire straight at tehran if the eu talks fail .
" the bar for iran must be set very high because of its history of deception " in years of concealing its nuclear program , said nicholas burns , us under secretary for political affairs , last week . the talks will bring together iran 's top nuclear negotiators with the so-called eu-3 - the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , along with eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the exact timing and location of the talks is unclear , but diplomats say the most likely is a meeting of senior officials in brussels on tuesday before the full ministerial talks on wednesday in geneva . enrichment resumed after halt after suspending nuclear activities late last year , tehran recently said that it intends to resume some of the work it brought to a halt under an agreement reached with britain , france and germany last november . but tehran insists its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including enriching uranium , is aimed at generating electricity and is a right for a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . with tensions mounting , iranian negotiator hossein moussavian has raised the rhetoric to new levels .
he said last week that if the talks fail , uranium conversion work - a precursor to enrichment - being carried out at a plant near the central city of isfahan could restart before the presidential election on june 17 .
" the decision on resuming activities at isfahan is irreversible , " he said . carrot and stick approach ineffective so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dealing with iran 's clerical regime , the eu has held the carrot ; offering trade , security and technological incentives .
in the background , the united states has wielded the stick , leaving " all options on the table " although its more overt threats of the past have receded recently . in its letter on may 11 inviting iran back to the negotiating table , the eu warned the regime it could be heading into dangerous , uncharted territory .
" it would bring the negotiating process to an end .
the consequences beyond could only be negative for iran , " the letter from the eu three britain , france and germany read . europeans ponder vital next move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohsen mirdamadi , right , a reformist and who heads the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs and national security , talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , at iran 's parliament building in tehran .
despite these options , diplomats believe there is little room for maneuver .
" the europeans could try to put a bit more on the table , but they will not go back on their core demand , a halt in enrichment .
they have an agreement on this with the americans , and can not afford to go back , " said one . if iran resumes its suspended nuclear activities , the matter is likely to go first to the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog . from there , it would be sent to the un security council - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
given the need for consensus , with nations like russia and china , the council may just issue a warning . is stand-off an election tactic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a savvy pragmatist who has attempted to make contacts with the united states in the past , attends a press conference , after registering as a presidential candidate at the interior ministry in tehran , iran , wednesday , may 11 , 2005 .
iran 's presidential election will take place june 17 .
the unknown factor is how much the tensions can be put down to iranian electioneering .
amid the preparations for next month 's presidential poll , state television is running announcements selling the benefits of nuclear power to the public . according to dr ali ansari , at britain 's royal institute of international affairs , the regime has to appear tough before the poll .

" the chancellor and i have given notice that we will seek to hold general elections in the autumn , " müntefering said .
the party would discuss the proposal on monday but the final decision would have to be made by the bundestag lower house of parliament , he added . schröder added that the " bitter defeat " for the spd " throws into question " his ruling coalition 's ability to govern .

" the chancellor and i have given notice that we will seek to hold general elections in the autumn , " müntefering said .
the party would discuss the proposal on monday but the final decision would have to be made by the bundestag lower house of parliament , he added . schröder added that the " bitter defeat " for the spd " throws into question " his ruling coalition 's ability to govern .
he was therefore in favour of holding a general election " in autumn this year " , one year ahead of the scheduled date . north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany with 18 million residents , was the last remaining state governed by a coalition of social democrats and greens , the so-called red-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . the defeat is the latest in a series of poor state election results for schröder 's party .
in 1999 , it governed in 11 of germany 's 16 states but is now in charge of only five . merkel hails sensational victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker kauder , left , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and chairwoman angela merkel , right , cheer in the party 's headquarters in berlin after a press conference following the announcement of exit polls of the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , sunday , may 22 , 2005 .
first exit polls predict a victory of the cdu .
the result is widely viewed as a strong indicator for next year 's national vote .
christian democrat leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schroeder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , hailed the outcome as " sensational " . " the voters have given the christian democratic union a sensational result , they have showed hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of early elections .
" every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " merkel said . new state premier rüttgers looks to fdp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers rüttgers , the cdu 's lead candidate in the state , had capitalized on the high unemployment rate in the heavily industrialized state where 1.1 million people are out of work , just over one fifth of the national total . a series of social security and labor market reforms introduced by schröder 's government have proved deeply unpopular with the spd 's traditional working-class voters .

television polls showed the extent of the defeat , showing the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in front with 45.0 percent , ahead of the spd 's 37.5 percent , and enough to win control of a region schröder 's party has ruled since 1966 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück the sdp 's peer steinbrück will make way as state premier for the conservative candidate jürgen rüttgers once the result has been confirmed . the shockwaves will be felt from the western state all the way to the capital and will surely reverberate through the coming 12 months , shaking schröder 's already faltering leadership ahead of the general election .
the loss of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is an indication that schröder 's hoped for a third term is looking increasingly less likely . in contrast , the result is likely to boost the chances that cdu leader angela merkel will run against schröder in 2006 , raising the prospect of germany 's first woman chancellor . a desperate shift to the left on the cards ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the likely policy change as a result of the defeat could see the sdp move further over to the left in a bid to win back traditional voters that abandoned them in nrw .
the left-wing of the party , which opposed the chancellor 's welfare reforms , has been clamoring for a return to more traditional worker-friendly policies and may get that swing on the back of the result on sunday . but the defeat may have more far-reaching consequences .
a cabinet reshuffle is a possibility with left-wing targets economy minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel in precarious positions .
german media reports have said outgoing nrw premier peer steinbrück could replace eichel . reforms may face the axe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loss of nrw could also force schröder to abandon plans to cut the basic corporate tax rate to 19 percent from 25 percent , a move designed to boost growth but strongly opposed by the left .

but the leftist rhetoric has come to late to save the state for the spd . the state had long been an spd stronghold dominated by the coal and steel industry but nrw has fallen on hard times .
unemployment in nrw , a state in which one in five germans live , surpassed the one million mark to a post-war high this year .
the cause of this , disgruntled residents say , is down to schröder 's controversial labor market reforms , which include jobless benefit cuts . red-green coalition on severely shaky ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's junior coalition party in the federal government was shown in the exit polls to have won 6.0 percent , the same amount as the cdu 's likely coalition partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
that puts the combined cdu-fdp at 51.0 percent , above the 43.5 percent of the spd and greens . the election result has ominous implications for the future of spd and greens cooperation as well as the future of the government .

"
gracia tries to identify charitable persons unknown germany 's entry in the 50th eurovision song contest finished last with four votes as greece took the crown at the celebration of kitsch in kiev on saturday .
gracia 's song " run and hide " had voters turning off . germany 's eurovision song contest hopes were more than dashed on saturday night ; they were thrown to the floor and stamped on by every stiletto and cuban heel on show at the 50th gala of kitsch in kiev . gracia bauer , a former talent show also-ran who had courted controversy over her involvement in a chart-rigging scandal just weeks before the competition , garnered a woeful four points with her song " run and hide " .
it seemed like the voters took her words as sound advice as germany scored one of its lowest totals in the history of the competition . the dubious accolade of eurovision winner went to greece as singer helena paparizou thrashed the competition , triumphing over contestants from 23 other countries with her song " my number one . "
the news was greeted with scenes of joys in athens , where hundreds of people celebrated on the streets of the greek capital . greece celebrates eurovision victory in athens , paparizou fans , who had watched the contest on a giant screen late saturday in front of the zappeion palace , went wild when the greek victory was announced .
brandishing greek flags , they danced and embraced to the beat of " my number one , " written by christos dantis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " many congratulations to helena , " said athens mayor dora bakoyannis , who was on the scene .
" it 's a unique moment that we deserve ...
athens is ready to welcome eurovision in 2006 . " ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , who attended the songfest with his family , handed paparizou the eurovision award .
yushchenko handed paparizou a golden trophy inspired by jewels crafted by the scythians , an ancient people that once inhabited the territory of present-day ukraine . " this is a ukrainian prize for best european song , for europe 's best singer -lrb- handed -rrb- in the name of a united europe , " yushchenko said after giving paparizou a peck on the cheek . clad in a short golden dress , paparizou , who was born and raised in sweden , gave an energetic performance which included elements of a traditional greek national dance . paparizou , who was elected by television viewers from 39 countries , won with 230 points , 38 points ahead of malta 's chiara , who placed second with the song " angel . "
romania 's luminita anghel and sistem placed third with " let me try . " controversy surrounds ukrainian song bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winner of eurovision 2004 ruslana lyzhychko with viktor yushchenko .
last year 's winner , ukraine 's ruslana , opened the competition with a performance of one of her songs , " fire " . this year 's ukrainian candidate , the greenjolly group , placed only 20th .
its selection to represent the former soviet republic had sparked controversy , as had its choice of song , " razom nas bahato " -lrb- together we are many -rrb- , the hymn sung by demonstrators against former president leonid kuchma 's regime in kiev 's independence square during last year 's " orange revolution . " greenjolly was largely unknown before the revolution and its last minute choice unleashed an avalanche of criticism of the new government which was accused of manipulating the vote that picked the group . to deflect criticism , greenjolly was obliged to modify the lyrics of the song , removing mention of the current president 's name . song contest a political opportunity ukraine 's authorities saw the eurovision contest as a way to showcase the country as 100 percent european , while yushchenko has made no secret of his hope to see kiev eventually join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine president viktor yushchenko has european designs " ukraine has always been a harmonious component of the -lrb- european -rrb- space , " the ukrainian leader said a few days before the songfest began .
" it has been made up not only by politicians , but also by peoples , their common values , their history and their culture .
these days in kiev , you will be able to feel this once more , " yushchenko said . the contest was held under tight security , as some 4,000 police stood by to make sure the 50th edition of the annual kitsch-fest did not get out of hand . before entering kiev 's sports palace , an arena capable of holding an audience of up to 8,000 , spectators had to submit to strict security checks and file under a metal detector . celebration of kitsch goes from strength to strength the eurovision song contest , first held in 1956 , is often associated with music of questionable merit , bizarre costumes and marked political bias in the voting .
yet all these elements have contributed to its enduring popularity . eurovision was a launch pad for the careers of such internationally famous performers as swedish disco group abba in the 1970s , or , later , french canadian singer celine dion , who represented switzerland , where she was living at the time . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politics and kitsch mix at eurovision as ukraine prepares to host this year 's eurovision song contest , it 's keen to present a new face to the world following last year 's " orange revolution .

however , the islamic state is calling the summit " europe 's last chance " . the european union will try to coax iran back from the nuclear brink this week , warning tehran it could be hauled before the un security council if it carries out a threat to resume key atomic activities . the islamic state - suspected by the united states of wanting to build atomic weapons - is calling the meeting " the last chance for the europeans " to come up with something worth bargaining for . but the pressure on iran is multiplied by washington , waiting to direct its diplomatic fire straight at tehran if the eu talks fail .
" the bar for iran must be set very high because of its history of deception " in years of concealing its nuclear program , said nicholas burns , us under secretary for political affairs , last week . the talks will bring together iran 's top nuclear negotiators with the so-called eu-3 - the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , along with eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the exact timing and location of the talks is unclear , but diplomats say the most likely is a meeting of senior officials in brussels on tuesday before the full ministerial talks on wednesday in geneva . enrichment resumed after halt after suspending nuclear activities late last year , tehran recently said that it intends to resume some of the work it brought to a halt under an agreement reached with britain , france and germany last november . but tehran insists its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including enriching uranium , is aimed at generating electricity and is a right for a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . with tensions mounting , iranian negotiator hossein moussavian has raised the rhetoric to new levels .
he said last week that if the talks fail , uranium conversion work - a precursor to enrichment - being carried out at a plant near the central city of isfahan could restart before the presidential election on june 17 .
" the decision on resuming activities at isfahan is irreversible , " he said . carrot and stick approach ineffective so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dealing with iran 's clerical regime , the eu has held the carrot ; offering trade , security and technological incentives .
in the background , the united states has wielded the stick , leaving " all options on the table " although its more overt threats of the past have receded recently . in its letter on may 11 inviting iran back to the negotiating table , the eu warned the regime it could be heading into dangerous , uncharted territory .
" it would bring the negotiating process to an end .

" the europeans could try to put a bit more on the table , but they will not go back on their core demand , a halt in enrichment .
they have an agreement on this with the americans , and can not afford to go back , " said one . if iran resumes its suspended nuclear activities , the matter is likely to go first to the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog . from there , it would be sent to the un security council - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .

" it 's wholly justified .
if we did not get the result we wanted we would not hesitate to use our veto , " the finance minister told bbc television . the british government rejects the eu proposals to freeze the annual budget rebate in 2007 and ultimately reduce it , arguing that it receives far less agricultural and regional development funding than its european counterparts . " it is the right thing to do because we get so little of the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- receipts , we get so little of the structural and cohesion funds receipts , that our rebate is wholly justified , " brown said . " i was at a meeting last saturday and made it absolutely clear that our rebate was wholly justified , " brown added , referring to the eu talks in luxembourg .
" jack straw is going -lrb- to the meeting in brussels -rrb- and he will make that absolutely clear as well . " straw to fight " unfairly high " demands straw said previously in march that his government was ready to use its veto to retain the long-cherished rebate - worth some three billion pounds -lrb- $ 5.5 billion , 4.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . the eu subsidies system has been modernized hugely since the rebate was first granted in 1984 - but london insists britain 's contribution to brussels would still be unfairly high without it . " the reason is because france , for example , is getting high amounts of agricultural subsidies receipts .
we do n't , " brown added .
" which means that without the rebate , there would be a gap which would mean that we would be paying far more than france , far more than italy , far more than other countries . " rebate preventing breakthrough on eu budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu finance ministers have been wrangling over the budget for months other brussels diplomats said that if it were not for the issue of britain 's rebate , the proposals by the luxembourg presidency could probably break a deadlock over the overall eu budget . " the presidency has done its work so well that technically it would not be very difficult to reach an agreement , " a french diplomat said .
" the real problem is the british rebate , " he added .
the french diplomat said that the problem was that successive british governments had lived on the rebate for 20 years and that the british were unlikely to budge .

" if we want to get a political agreement , everybody around the table has to make sacrifices , but sacrifices that they can justify , " a luxembourg source said . the battle lines over the overall eu 's budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 are roughly drawn between the european commission which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . commission pushing for increased contributions luxembourg has proposed an overall budget for the eu in a range from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.085 trillion - $ 1.129 trillion -rrb- , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gross national income . the commission is angling for an eu budget of one trillion euros while the six main contributors have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gni . while putting the british rebate into question , the luxembourg proposals suggest that germany , the netherlands and sweden - the biggest contributors to the eu 's budget - should benefit from " specific measures " . taking a leaf out of margaret thatcher 's book , luxembourg proposals said such measures were justified because " no member state should sustain a budgetary burden which is excessive in relation to its relative prosperity " .

"
gracia tries to identify charitable persons unknown germany 's entry in the 50th eurovision song contest finished last with four votes as greece took the crown at the celebration of kitsch in kiev on saturday .
gracia 's song " run and hide " had voters turning off . germany 's eurovision song contest hopes were more than dashed on saturday night ; they were thrown to the floor and stamped on by every stiletto and cuban heel on show at the 50th gala of kitsch in kiev . gracia bauer , a former talent show also-ran who had courted controversy over her involvement in a chart-rigging scandal just weeks before the competition , garnered a woeful four points with her song " run and hide " .
it seemed like the voters took her words as sound advice as germany scored one of its lowest totals in the history of the competition . the dubious accolade of eurovision winner went to greece as singer helena paparizou thrashed the competition , triumphing over contestants from 23 other countries with her song " my number one . "
the news was greeted with scenes of joys in athens , where hundreds of people celebrated on the streets of the greek capital . greece celebrates eurovision victory in athens , paparizou fans , who had watched the contest on a giant screen late saturday in front of the zappeion palace , went wild when the greek victory was announced .
brandishing greek flags , they danced and embraced to the beat of " my number one , " written by christos dantis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " many congratulations to helena , " said athens mayor dora bakoyannis , who was on the scene .
" it 's a unique moment that we deserve ...
athens is ready to welcome eurovision in 2006 . " ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , who attended the songfest with his family , handed paparizou the eurovision award .
yushchenko handed paparizou a golden trophy inspired by jewels crafted by the scythians , an ancient people that once inhabited the territory of present-day ukraine . " this is a ukrainian prize for best european song , for europe 's best singer -lrb- handed -rrb- in the name of a united europe , " yushchenko said after giving paparizou a peck on the cheek . clad in a short golden dress , paparizou , who was born and raised in sweden , gave an energetic performance which included elements of a traditional greek national dance . paparizou , who was elected by television viewers from 39 countries , won with 230 points , 38 points ahead of malta 's chiara , who placed second with the song " angel . "
romania 's luminita anghel and sistem placed third with " let me try . " controversy surrounds ukrainian song bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winner of eurovision 2004 ruslana lyzhychko with viktor yushchenko .
last year 's winner , ukraine 's ruslana , opened the competition with a performance of one of her songs , " fire " . this year 's ukrainian candidate , the greenjolly group , placed only 20th .
its selection to represent the former soviet republic had sparked controversy , as had its choice of song , " razom nas bahato " -lrb- together we are many -rrb- , the hymn sung by demonstrators against former president leonid kuchma 's regime in kiev 's independence square during last year 's " orange revolution . " greenjolly was largely unknown before the revolution and its last minute choice unleashed an avalanche of criticism of the new government which was accused of manipulating the vote that picked the group . to deflect criticism , greenjolly was obliged to modify the lyrics of the song , removing mention of the current president 's name . song contest a political opportunity ukraine 's authorities saw the eurovision contest as a way to showcase the country as 100 percent european , while yushchenko has made no secret of his hope to see kiev eventually join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine president viktor yushchenko has european designs " ukraine has always been a harmonious component of the -lrb- european -rrb- space , " the ukrainian leader said a few days before the songfest began .
" it has been made up not only by politicians , but also by peoples , their common values , their history and their culture .
these days in kiev , you will be able to feel this once more , " yushchenko said . the contest was held under tight security , as some 4,000 police stood by to make sure the 50th edition of the annual kitsch-fest did not get out of hand . before entering kiev 's sports palace , an arena capable of holding an audience of up to 8,000 , spectators had to submit to strict security checks and file under a metal detector . celebration of kitsch goes from strength to strength the eurovision song contest , first held in 1956 , is often associated with music of questionable merit , bizarre costumes and marked political bias in the voting .
yet all these elements have contributed to its enduring popularity . eurovision was a launch pad for the careers of such internationally famous performers as swedish disco group abba in the 1970s , or , later , french canadian singer celine dion , who represented switzerland , where she was living at the time . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politics and kitsch mix at eurovision as ukraine prepares to host this year 's eurovision song contest , it 's keen to present a new face to the world following last year 's " orange revolution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.05.2005 social democrats ousted in state election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers will be the new cdu state premier of nrw exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years . the expected , but no less bitter , defeat in the north rhine-westphalia state election has deposed german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- from their power base after 39 years , exit polls showed on sunday evening . the loss of germany 's most populous state is a major blow for the sdp with national elections planned for september 2006 .
television polls showed the extent of the defeat , showing the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in front with 45.0 percent , ahead of the spd 's 37.5 percent , and enough to win control of a region schröder 's party has ruled since 1966 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück the sdp 's peer steinbrück will make way as state premier for the conservative candidate jürgen rüttgers once the result has been confirmed . the shockwaves will be felt from the western state all the way to the capital and will surely reverberate through the coming 12 months , shaking schröder 's already faltering leadership ahead of the general election .
the loss of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is an indication that schröder 's hoped for a third term is looking increasingly less likely . in contrast , the result is likely to boost the chances that cdu leader angela merkel will run against schröder in 2006 , raising the prospect of germany 's first woman chancellor . a desperate shift to the left on the cards ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the likely policy change as a result of the defeat could see the sdp move further over to the left in a bid to win back traditional voters that abandoned them in nrw .
the left-wing of the party , which opposed the chancellor 's welfare reforms , has been clamoring for a return to more traditional worker-friendly policies and may get that swing on the back of the result on sunday . but the defeat may have more far-reaching consequences .
a cabinet reshuffle is a possibility with left-wing targets economy minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel in precarious positions .
german media reports have said outgoing nrw premier peer steinbrück could replace eichel . reforms may face the axe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loss of nrw could also force schröder to abandon plans to cut the basic corporate tax rate to 19 percent from 25 percent , a move designed to boost growth but strongly opposed by the left .
an extension of the minimum wage to all sectors of the economy and tighter controls on hedge funds are other likely outcomes . spd party leader franz müntefering has been telegraphing the possible return to the left for weeks , launching a scathing attack on " pure capitalism " and likening some financial investors to " locusts " .
but the leftist rhetoric has come to late to save the state for the spd . the state had long been an spd stronghold dominated by the coal and steel industry but nrw has fallen on hard times .
unemployment in nrw , a state in which one in five germans live , surpassed the one million mark to a post-war high this year .
the cause of this , disgruntled residents say , is down to schröder 's controversial labor market reforms , which include jobless benefit cuts . red-green coalition on severely shaky ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's junior coalition party in the federal government was shown in the exit polls to have won 6.0 percent , the same amount as the cdu 's likely coalition partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
that puts the combined cdu-fdp at 51.0 percent , above the 43.5 percent of the spd and greens . the election result has ominous implications for the future of spd and greens cooperation as well as the future of the government .
nrw was the last german state ruled by the red-green coalition and the result leaves the increasingly tense federal partnership in berlin as the final alliance between the two parties . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats face tough election fight sunday 's state election in north rhine-westphalia looks increasingly to be a victory ripe for the opposition cdu 's picking .
an spd defeat would be bad news for the government ahead of the general election in 2006 .
-lrb- may 22 , 2005 -rrb- fear and confusion on the campaign trail the north rhine-westphalia state election has been the center of attention for weeks .
but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike .

television polls showed the extent of the defeat , showing the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in front with 45.0 percent , ahead of the spd 's 37.5 percent , and enough to win control of a region schröder 's party has ruled since 1966 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück the sdp 's peer steinbrück will make way as state premier for the conservative candidate jürgen rüttgers once the result has been confirmed . the shockwaves will be felt from the western state all the way to the capital and will surely reverberate through the coming 12 months , shaking schröder 's already faltering leadership ahead of the general election .
the loss of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is an indication that schröder 's hoped for a third term is looking increasingly less likely . in contrast , the result is likely to boost the chances that cdu leader angela merkel will run against schröder in 2006 , raising the prospect of germany 's first woman chancellor . a desperate shift to the left on the cards ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the likely policy change as a result of the defeat could see the sdp move further over to the left in a bid to win back traditional voters that abandoned them in nrw .
the left-wing of the party , which opposed the chancellor 's welfare reforms , has been clamoring for a return to more traditional worker-friendly policies and may get that swing on the back of the result on sunday . but the defeat may have more far-reaching consequences .
a cabinet reshuffle is a possibility with left-wing targets economy minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel in precarious positions .
german media reports have said outgoing nrw premier peer steinbrück could replace eichel . reforms may face the axe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loss of nrw could also force schröder to abandon plans to cut the basic corporate tax rate to 19 percent from 25 percent , a move designed to boost growth but strongly opposed by the left .
an extension of the minimum wage to all sectors of the economy and tighter controls on hedge funds are other likely outcomes . spd party leader franz müntefering has been telegraphing the possible return to the left for weeks , launching a scathing attack on " pure capitalism " and likening some financial investors to " locusts " .
but the leftist rhetoric has come to late to save the state for the spd . the state had long been an spd stronghold dominated by the coal and steel industry but nrw has fallen on hard times .
unemployment in nrw , a state in which one in five germans live , surpassed the one million mark to a post-war high this year .
the cause of this , disgruntled residents say , is down to schröder 's controversial labor market reforms , which include jobless benefit cuts . red-green coalition on severely shaky ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's junior coalition party in the federal government was shown in the exit polls to have won 6.0 percent , the same amount as the cdu 's likely coalition partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
that puts the combined cdu-fdp at 51.0 percent , above the 43.5 percent of the spd and greens . the election result has ominous implications for the future of spd and greens cooperation as well as the future of the government .
nrw was the last german state ruled by the red-green coalition and the result leaves the increasingly tense federal partnership in berlin as the final alliance between the two parties . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats face tough election fight sunday 's state election in north rhine-westphalia looks increasingly to be a victory ripe for the opposition cdu 's picking .

-lrb- may 22 , 2005 -rrb- fear and confusion on the campaign trail the north rhine-westphalia state election has been the center of attention for weeks .

"
gracia tries to identify charitable persons unknown germany 's entry in the 50th eurovision song contest finished last with four votes as greece took the crown at the celebration of kitsch in kiev on saturday .
gracia 's song " run and hide " had voters turning off . germany 's eurovision song contest hopes were more than dashed on saturday night ; they were thrown to the floor and stamped on by every stiletto and cuban heel on show at the 50th gala of kitsch in kiev . gracia bauer , a former talent show also-ran who had courted controversy over her involvement in a chart-rigging scandal just weeks before the competition , garnered a woeful four points with her song " run and hide " .
it seemed like the voters took her words as sound advice as germany scored one of its lowest totals in the history of the competition . the dubious accolade of eurovision winner went to greece as singer helena paparizou thrashed the competition , triumphing over contestants from 23 other countries with her song " my number one . "
the news was greeted with scenes of joys in athens , where hundreds of people celebrated on the streets of the greek capital . greece celebrates eurovision victory in athens , paparizou fans , who had watched the contest on a giant screen late saturday in front of the zappeion palace , went wild when the greek victory was announced .
brandishing greek flags , they danced and embraced to the beat of " my number one , " written by christos dantis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " many congratulations to helena , " said athens mayor dora bakoyannis , who was on the scene .
" it 's a unique moment that we deserve ...
athens is ready to welcome eurovision in 2006 . " ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , who attended the songfest with his family , handed paparizou the eurovision award .
yushchenko handed paparizou a golden trophy inspired by jewels crafted by the scythians , an ancient people that once inhabited the territory of present-day ukraine . " this is a ukrainian prize for best european song , for europe 's best singer -lrb- handed -rrb- in the name of a united europe , " yushchenko said after giving paparizou a peck on the cheek . clad in a short golden dress , paparizou , who was born and raised in sweden , gave an energetic performance which included elements of a traditional greek national dance . paparizou , who was elected by television viewers from 39 countries , won with 230 points , 38 points ahead of malta 's chiara , who placed second with the song " angel . "
romania 's luminita anghel and sistem placed third with " let me try . " controversy surrounds ukrainian song bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winner of eurovision 2004 ruslana lyzhychko with viktor yushchenko .
last year 's winner , ukraine 's ruslana , opened the competition with a performance of one of her songs , " fire " . this year 's ukrainian candidate , the greenjolly group , placed only 20th .
its selection to represent the former soviet republic had sparked controversy , as had its choice of song , " razom nas bahato " -lrb- together we are many -rrb- , the hymn sung by demonstrators against former president leonid kuchma 's regime in kiev 's independence square during last year 's " orange revolution . " greenjolly was largely unknown before the revolution and its last minute choice unleashed an avalanche of criticism of the new government which was accused of manipulating the vote that picked the group . to deflect criticism , greenjolly was obliged to modify the lyrics of the song , removing mention of the current president 's name . song contest a political opportunity ukraine 's authorities saw the eurovision contest as a way to showcase the country as 100 percent european , while yushchenko has made no secret of his hope to see kiev eventually join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine president viktor yushchenko has european designs " ukraine has always been a harmonious component of the -lrb- european -rrb- space , " the ukrainian leader said a few days before the songfest began .
" it has been made up not only by politicians , but also by peoples , their common values , their history and their culture .
these days in kiev , you will be able to feel this once more , " yushchenko said . the contest was held under tight security , as some 4,000 police stood by to make sure the 50th edition of the annual kitsch-fest did not get out of hand . before entering kiev 's sports palace , an arena capable of holding an audience of up to 8,000 , spectators had to submit to strict security checks and file under a metal detector . celebration of kitsch goes from strength to strength the eurovision song contest , first held in 1956 , is often associated with music of questionable merit , bizarre costumes and marked political bias in the voting .
yet all these elements have contributed to its enduring popularity . eurovision was a launch pad for the careers of such internationally famous performers as swedish disco group abba in the 1970s , or , later , french canadian singer celine dion , who represented switzerland , where she was living at the time . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politics and kitsch mix at eurovision as ukraine prepares to host this year 's eurovision song contest , it 's keen to present a new face to the world following last year 's " orange revolution .

television polls showed the extent of the defeat , showing the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in front with 45.0 percent , ahead of the spd 's 37.5 percent , and enough to win control of a region schröder 's party has ruled since 1966 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück the sdp 's peer steinbrück will make way as state premier for the conservative candidate jürgen rüttgers once the result has been confirmed . the shockwaves will be felt from the western state all the way to the capital and will surely reverberate through the coming 12 months , shaking schröder 's already faltering leadership ahead of the general election .
the loss of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is an indication that schröder 's hoped for a third term is looking increasingly less likely . in contrast , the result is likely to boost the chances that cdu leader angela merkel will run against schröder in 2006 , raising the prospect of germany 's first woman chancellor . a desperate shift to the left on the cards ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the likely policy change as a result of the defeat could see the sdp move further over to the left in a bid to win back traditional voters that abandoned them in nrw .

however , the islamic state is calling the summit " europe 's last chance " . the european union will try to coax iran back from the nuclear brink this week , warning tehran it could be hauled before the un security council if it carries out a threat to resume key atomic activities . the islamic state - suspected by the united states of wanting to build atomic weapons - is calling the meeting " the last chance for the europeans " to come up with something worth bargaining for . but the pressure on iran is multiplied by washington , waiting to direct its diplomatic fire straight at tehran if the eu talks fail .
" the bar for iran must be set very high because of its history of deception " in years of concealing its nuclear program , said nicholas burns , us under secretary for political affairs , last week . the talks will bring together iran 's top nuclear negotiators with the so-called eu-3 - the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , along with eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the exact timing and location of the talks is unclear , but diplomats say the most likely is a meeting of senior officials in brussels on tuesday before the full ministerial talks on wednesday in geneva . enrichment resumed after halt after suspending nuclear activities late last year , tehran recently said that it intends to resume some of the work it brought to a halt under an agreement reached with britain , france and germany last november . but tehran insists its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including enriching uranium , is aimed at generating electricity and is a right for a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . with tensions mounting , iranian negotiator hossein moussavian has raised the rhetoric to new levels .
he said last week that if the talks fail , uranium conversion work - a precursor to enrichment - being carried out at a plant near the central city of isfahan could restart before the presidential election on june 17 .
" the decision on resuming activities at isfahan is irreversible , " he said . carrot and stick approach ineffective so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dealing with iran 's clerical regime , the eu has held the carrot ; offering trade , security and technological incentives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.05.2005 european union targets britain 's rebate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister blair and chancellor brown face eu pressure britain faces some of the fiercest pressure in more than 20 years over its annual rebate from the european budget when eu ministers meet on sunday to battle over how much they pay into and get out of the collective pot . the ministers are meeting in brussles over dinner on sunday to voice their positions on the european union 's long-term budget before getting down to the hard bargaining at an official gathering on monday . but many of the big eu countries have already made their positions known , making statements in recent weeks to the effect that they want britain 's coveted annual rebate reconsidered . the leaders of france , germany and poland stepped up the pressure on britain with a joint call on thursday for the rebate to be reconsidered and changed . on top of that , the eu 's current luxembourg presidency proposed that the rebate be frozen and progressively reduced , seriously calling it into question for the first time since britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher secured it in 1984 . a british diplomat here said that the proposal was " utterly unacceptable " , insisting that " the british rebate , as far as we are concerned , is fully justifiable " . gordon brown threatens veto to secure rebate meanwhile , the chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown said sunday that britain would not hesitate to use its veto to hold on to its two-decade-old rebate .
" it 's wholly justified .
if we did not get the result we wanted we would not hesitate to use our veto , " the finance minister told bbc television . the british government rejects the eu proposals to freeze the annual budget rebate in 2007 and ultimately reduce it , arguing that it receives far less agricultural and regional development funding than its european counterparts . " it is the right thing to do because we get so little of the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- receipts , we get so little of the structural and cohesion funds receipts , that our rebate is wholly justified , " brown said . " i was at a meeting last saturday and made it absolutely clear that our rebate was wholly justified , " brown added , referring to the eu talks in luxembourg .
" jack straw is going -lrb- to the meeting in brussels -rrb- and he will make that absolutely clear as well . " straw to fight " unfairly high " demands straw said previously in march that his government was ready to use its veto to retain the long-cherished rebate - worth some three billion pounds -lrb- $ 5.5 billion , 4.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . the eu subsidies system has been modernized hugely since the rebate was first granted in 1984 - but london insists britain 's contribution to brussels would still be unfairly high without it . " the reason is because france , for example , is getting high amounts of agricultural subsidies receipts .
we do n't , " brown added .
" which means that without the rebate , there would be a gap which would mean that we would be paying far more than france , far more than italy , far more than other countries . " rebate preventing breakthrough on eu budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu finance ministers have been wrangling over the budget for months other brussels diplomats said that if it were not for the issue of britain 's rebate , the proposals by the luxembourg presidency could probably break a deadlock over the overall eu budget . " the presidency has done its work so well that technically it would not be very difficult to reach an agreement , " a french diplomat said .

" it 's wholly justified .
if we did not get the result we wanted we would not hesitate to use our veto , " the finance minister told bbc television . the british government rejects the eu proposals to freeze the annual budget rebate in 2007 and ultimately reduce it , arguing that it receives far less agricultural and regional development funding than its european counterparts . " it is the right thing to do because we get so little of the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- receipts , we get so little of the structural and cohesion funds receipts , that our rebate is wholly justified , " brown said . " i was at a meeting last saturday and made it absolutely clear that our rebate was wholly justified , " brown added , referring to the eu talks in luxembourg .
" jack straw is going -lrb- to the meeting in brussels -rrb- and he will make that absolutely clear as well . " straw to fight " unfairly high " demands straw said previously in march that his government was ready to use its veto to retain the long-cherished rebate - worth some three billion pounds -lrb- $ 5.5 billion , 4.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . the eu subsidies system has been modernized hugely since the rebate was first granted in 1984 - but london insists britain 's contribution to brussels would still be unfairly high without it . " the reason is because france , for example , is getting high amounts of agricultural subsidies receipts .
we do n't , " brown added .
" which means that without the rebate , there would be a gap which would mean that we would be paying far more than france , far more than italy , far more than other countries . " rebate preventing breakthrough on eu budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu finance ministers have been wrangling over the budget for months other brussels diplomats said that if it were not for the issue of britain 's rebate , the proposals by the luxembourg presidency could probably break a deadlock over the overall eu budget .

" if we want to get a political agreement , everybody around the table has to make sacrifices , but sacrifices that they can justify , " a luxembourg source said . the battle lines over the overall eu 's budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 are roughly drawn between the european commission which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . commission pushing for increased contributions luxembourg has proposed an overall budget for the eu in a range from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.085 trillion - $ 1.129 trillion -rrb- , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gross national income . the commission is angling for an eu budget of one trillion euros while the six main contributors have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gni . while putting the british rebate into question , the luxembourg proposals suggest that germany , the netherlands and sweden - the biggest contributors to the eu 's budget - should benefit from " specific measures " . taking a leaf out of margaret thatcher 's book , luxembourg proposals said such measures were justified because " no member state should sustain a budgetary burden which is excessive in relation to its relative prosperity " .

" it 's wholly justified .
if we did not get the result we wanted we would not hesitate to use our veto , " the finance minister told bbc television . the british government rejects the eu proposals to freeze the annual budget rebate in 2007 and ultimately reduce it , arguing that it receives far less agricultural and regional development funding than its european counterparts . " it is the right thing to do because we get so little of the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- receipts , we get so little of the structural and cohesion funds receipts , that our rebate is wholly justified , " brown said . " i was at a meeting last saturday and made it absolutely clear that our rebate was wholly justified , " brown added , referring to the eu talks in luxembourg .
" jack straw is going -lrb- to the meeting in brussels -rrb- and he will make that absolutely clear as well . " straw to fight " unfairly high " demands straw said previously in march that his government was ready to use its veto to retain the long-cherished rebate - worth some three billion pounds -lrb- $ 5.5 billion , 4.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . the eu subsidies system has been modernized hugely since the rebate was first granted in 1984 - but london insists britain 's contribution to brussels would still be unfairly high without it . " the reason is because france , for example , is getting high amounts of agricultural subsidies receipts .
we do n't , " brown added .
" which means that without the rebate , there would be a gap which would mean that we would be paying far more than france , far more than italy , far more than other countries . " rebate preventing breakthrough on eu budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu finance ministers have been wrangling over the budget for months other brussels diplomats said that if it were not for the issue of britain 's rebate , the proposals by the luxembourg presidency could probably break a deadlock over the overall eu budget . " the presidency has done its work so well that technically it would not be very difficult to reach an agreement , " a french diplomat said .
" the real problem is the british rebate , " he added .
the french diplomat said that the problem was that successive british governments had lived on the rebate for 20 years and that the british were unlikely to budge .
for the british , " there is the crown and the check " he said . eu wants budget sorted before britain 's presidency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg , a veteran broker in eu affairs , wants an agreement to be struck at a summit in brussles of eu leaders on june 16 and 17 because otherwise the budget likely will languish once britain takes over the eu 's rotating presidency for six months in july .

"
gracia tries to identify charitable persons unknown germany 's entry in the 50th eurovision song contest finished last with four votes as greece took the crown at the celebration of kitsch in kiev on saturday .
gracia 's song " run and hide " had voters turning off . germany 's eurovision song contest hopes were more than dashed on saturday night ; they were thrown to the floor and stamped on by every stiletto and cuban heel on show at the 50th gala of kitsch in kiev . gracia bauer , a former talent show also-ran who had courted controversy over her involvement in a chart-rigging scandal just weeks before the competition , garnered a woeful four points with her song " run and hide " .
it seemed like the voters took her words as sound advice as germany scored one of its lowest totals in the history of the competition . the dubious accolade of eurovision winner went to greece as singer helena paparizou thrashed the competition , triumphing over contestants from 23 other countries with her song " my number one . "
the news was greeted with scenes of joys in athens , where hundreds of people celebrated on the streets of the greek capital . greece celebrates eurovision victory in athens , paparizou fans , who had watched the contest on a giant screen late saturday in front of the zappeion palace , went wild when the greek victory was announced .
brandishing greek flags , they danced and embraced to the beat of " my number one , " written by christos dantis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " many congratulations to helena , " said athens mayor dora bakoyannis , who was on the scene .
" it 's a unique moment that we deserve ...
athens is ready to welcome eurovision in 2006 . " ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , who attended the songfest with his family , handed paparizou the eurovision award .
yushchenko handed paparizou a golden trophy inspired by jewels crafted by the scythians , an ancient people that once inhabited the territory of present-day ukraine . " this is a ukrainian prize for best european song , for europe 's best singer -lrb- handed -rrb- in the name of a united europe , " yushchenko said after giving paparizou a peck on the cheek . clad in a short golden dress , paparizou , who was born and raised in sweden , gave an energetic performance which included elements of a traditional greek national dance . paparizou , who was elected by television viewers from 39 countries , won with 230 points , 38 points ahead of malta 's chiara , who placed second with the song " angel . "
romania 's luminita anghel and sistem placed third with " let me try . " controversy surrounds ukrainian song bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winner of eurovision 2004 ruslana lyzhychko with viktor yushchenko .
last year 's winner , ukraine 's ruslana , opened the competition with a performance of one of her songs , " fire " . this year 's ukrainian candidate , the greenjolly group , placed only 20th .
its selection to represent the former soviet republic had sparked controversy , as had its choice of song , " razom nas bahato " -lrb- together we are many -rrb- , the hymn sung by demonstrators against former president leonid kuchma 's regime in kiev 's independence square during last year 's " orange revolution . " greenjolly was largely unknown before the revolution and its last minute choice unleashed an avalanche of criticism of the new government which was accused of manipulating the vote that picked the group . to deflect criticism , greenjolly was obliged to modify the lyrics of the song , removing mention of the current president 's name . song contest a political opportunity ukraine 's authorities saw the eurovision contest as a way to showcase the country as 100 percent european , while yushchenko has made no secret of his hope to see kiev eventually join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine president viktor yushchenko has european designs " ukraine has always been a harmonious component of the -lrb- european -rrb- space , " the ukrainian leader said a few days before the songfest began .
" it has been made up not only by politicians , but also by peoples , their common values , their history and their culture .
these days in kiev , you will be able to feel this once more , " yushchenko said . the contest was held under tight security , as some 4,000 police stood by to make sure the 50th edition of the annual kitsch-fest did not get out of hand . before entering kiev 's sports palace , an arena capable of holding an audience of up to 8,000 , spectators had to submit to strict security checks and file under a metal detector . celebration of kitsch goes from strength to strength the eurovision song contest , first held in 1956 , is often associated with music of questionable merit , bizarre costumes and marked political bias in the voting .
yet all these elements have contributed to its enduring popularity . eurovision was a launch pad for the careers of such internationally famous performers as swedish disco group abba in the 1970s , or , later , french canadian singer celine dion , who represented switzerland , where she was living at the time . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politics and kitsch mix at eurovision as ukraine prepares to host this year 's eurovision song contest , it 's keen to present a new face to the world following last year 's " orange revolution .

television polls showed the extent of the defeat , showing the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in front with 45.0 percent , ahead of the spd 's 37.5 percent , and enough to win control of a region schröder 's party has ruled since 1966 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück the sdp 's peer steinbrück will make way as state premier for the conservative candidate jürgen rüttgers once the result has been confirmed . the shockwaves will be felt from the western state all the way to the capital and will surely reverberate through the coming 12 months , shaking schröder 's already faltering leadership ahead of the general election .
the loss of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is an indication that schröder 's hoped for a third term is looking increasingly less likely . in contrast , the result is likely to boost the chances that cdu leader angela merkel will run against schröder in 2006 , raising the prospect of germany 's first woman chancellor . a desperate shift to the left on the cards ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the likely policy change as a result of the defeat could see the sdp move further over to the left in a bid to win back traditional voters that abandoned them in nrw .
the left-wing of the party , which opposed the chancellor 's welfare reforms , has been clamoring for a return to more traditional worker-friendly policies and may get that swing on the back of the result on sunday . but the defeat may have more far-reaching consequences .
a cabinet reshuffle is a possibility with left-wing targets economy minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel in precarious positions .
german media reports have said outgoing nrw premier peer steinbrück could replace eichel . reforms may face the axe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loss of nrw could also force schröder to abandon plans to cut the basic corporate tax rate to 19 percent from 25 percent , a move designed to boost growth but strongly opposed by the left .
an extension of the minimum wage to all sectors of the economy and tighter controls on hedge funds are other likely outcomes . spd party leader franz müntefering has been telegraphing the possible return to the left for weeks , launching a scathing attack on " pure capitalism " and likening some financial investors to " locusts " .
but the leftist rhetoric has come to late to save the state for the spd . the state had long been an spd stronghold dominated by the coal and steel industry but nrw has fallen on hard times .
unemployment in nrw , a state in which one in five germans live , surpassed the one million mark to a post-war high this year .
the cause of this , disgruntled residents say , is down to schröder 's controversial labor market reforms , which include jobless benefit cuts . red-green coalition on severely shaky ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's junior coalition party in the federal government was shown in the exit polls to have won 6.0 percent , the same amount as the cdu 's likely coalition partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
that puts the combined cdu-fdp at 51.0 percent , above the 43.5 percent of the spd and greens . the election result has ominous implications for the future of spd and greens cooperation as well as the future of the government .
nrw was the last german state ruled by the red-green coalition and the result leaves the increasingly tense federal partnership in berlin as the final alliance between the two parties . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats face tough election fight sunday 's state election in north rhine-westphalia looks increasingly to be a victory ripe for the opposition cdu 's picking .

an spd defeat would be bad news for the government ahead of the general election in 2006 . germany 's social democrats have their backs to the wall ahead of a key weekend election in a state they have held for nearly four decades , which could spell the beginning of the end for the government of chancellor gerhard schröder . schröder made a passionate plea to voters on friday to back his social democrats and their green coalition partners in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state with 18 million people . opinion polls show the social democrats are set to lose control of the state in sunday 's vote , after 39 years in charge - as disgruntled voters alarmed over a steady loss of jobs and erosion of social benefits head in droves to the opposition . defeat could spell bad omen for 2006 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder be walking away come 2006 ?
the state which forms the industrial heartland of germany appears almost certain to elect the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , an ominous sign for schröder as a general election looms in september 2006 .
defeat in the social democrat stronghold of 13.3 million voters would complete a miserable series of state election results for the chancellor . in 1999 , the spd governed in 11 of germany 's 16 regions but if it loses on sunday it will be in charge of only five . north rhine-westphalia is the only state ruled by a social democrat-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . schröder pleads with nrw for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , schröder told party supporters in dortmund that the state must stay loyal to its traditional politics .
" social democracy is the trademark of north rhine-westphalia and it must remain that way , " the chancellor said , flanked by spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero who had come to lend his support .
the federal government " needs the support of north rhine-westphalia , " schröder said , praising the state for its " social cohesion " . concerning the social security and labor market reforms that have improved competitiveness but swelled unemployment to 1.1 million in this region of coalmines and steelworks , schröder said they were a bitter pill germany must swallow .
" we must complete the overhaul of our social state , " he said .
" if we do not solve these problems we have no chance of staying among the top nations in the world . " unemployment has soared to around five million nationally and north rhine-westphalia has been particularly hard hit where in some areas close to one-quarter of the work force is jobless .
thirty years ago , coal and steel accounted for 830,000 jobs in the state , but now the figure is just 130,000 and as a result , unemployment in the most blighted areas is twice as high as the state average of 12 percent . opposition lead looks conclusive , says poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's jürgen rüttgers and his wife angelika on the campaign trail the conservative cdu is credited with 44 percent of the vote in north rhine-westphalia , ahead of the social democrats with 25 percent , the greens with nine percent and the liberal free democrats ' seven percent , according to a poll released by zdf public television . however the current state premier , peer steinbrueck , enjoys a high approval rating - 52 percent would back him if he were standing for direct election , against 30 percent for his conservative rival jürgen rüttgers , according to a poll published by ard public television . spd pins hopes on " undecided " voters steinbrueck , who admits on his campaign poster that he " can not promise jobs " , conceded on friday that " nationally , the overall trend is strongly against the spd " , but pointed to the large number of undecided voters as proof that the race was far from over . however , even if it takes north-rhine westphalia , the cdu will still lack the two-thirds majority in the federal upper chamber , or bundesrat , that would enable it to block the government 's decisions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear and confusion on the campaign trail the north rhine-westphalia state election has been the center of attention for weeks .

an spd defeat would be bad news for the government ahead of the general election in 2006 . germany 's social democrats have their backs to the wall ahead of a key weekend election in a state they have held for nearly four decades , which could spell the beginning of the end for the government of chancellor gerhard schröder . schröder made a passionate plea to voters on friday to back his social democrats and their green coalition partners in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state with 18 million people . opinion polls show the social democrats are set to lose control of the state in sunday 's vote , after 39 years in charge - as disgruntled voters alarmed over a steady loss of jobs and erosion of social benefits head in droves to the opposition . defeat could spell bad omen for 2006 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder be walking away come 2006 ?

the federal government " needs the support of north rhine-westphalia , " schröder said , praising the state for its " social cohesion " . concerning the social security and labor market reforms that have improved competitiveness but swelled unemployment to 1.1 million in this region of coalmines and steelworks , schröder said they were a bitter pill germany must swallow .

television polls showed the extent of the defeat , showing the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in front with 45.0 percent , ahead of the spd 's 37.5 percent , and enough to win control of a region schröder 's party has ruled since 1966 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück the sdp 's peer steinbrück will make way as state premier for the conservative candidate jürgen rüttgers once the result has been confirmed . the shockwaves will be felt from the western state all the way to the capital and will surely reverberate through the coming 12 months , shaking schröder 's already faltering leadership ahead of the general election .
the loss of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is an indication that schröder 's hoped for a third term is looking increasingly less likely . in contrast , the result is likely to boost the chances that cdu leader angela merkel will run against schröder in 2006 , raising the prospect of germany 's first woman chancellor . a desperate shift to the left on the cards ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the likely policy change as a result of the defeat could see the sdp move further over to the left in a bid to win back traditional voters that abandoned them in nrw .
the left-wing of the party , which opposed the chancellor 's welfare reforms , has been clamoring for a return to more traditional worker-friendly policies and may get that swing on the back of the result on sunday . but the defeat may have more far-reaching consequences .
a cabinet reshuffle is a possibility with left-wing targets economy minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel in precarious positions .
german media reports have said outgoing nrw premier peer steinbrück could replace eichel . reforms may face the axe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loss of nrw could also force schröder to abandon plans to cut the basic corporate tax rate to 19 percent from 25 percent , a move designed to boost growth but strongly opposed by the left .
an extension of the minimum wage to all sectors of the economy and tighter controls on hedge funds are other likely outcomes . spd party leader franz müntefering has been telegraphing the possible return to the left for weeks , launching a scathing attack on " pure capitalism " and likening some financial investors to " locusts " .
but the leftist rhetoric has come to late to save the state for the spd . the state had long been an spd stronghold dominated by the coal and steel industry but nrw has fallen on hard times .
unemployment in nrw , a state in which one in five germans live , surpassed the one million mark to a post-war high this year .
the cause of this , disgruntled residents say , is down to schröder 's controversial labor market reforms , which include jobless benefit cuts . red-green coalition on severely shaky ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's junior coalition party in the federal government was shown in the exit polls to have won 6.0 percent , the same amount as the cdu 's likely coalition partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
that puts the combined cdu-fdp at 51.0 percent , above the 43.5 percent of the spd and greens . the election result has ominous implications for the future of spd and greens cooperation as well as the future of the government .
nrw was the last german state ruled by the red-green coalition and the result leaves the increasingly tense federal partnership in berlin as the final alliance between the two parties . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats face tough election fight sunday 's state election in north rhine-westphalia looks increasingly to be a victory ripe for the opposition cdu 's picking .

an spd defeat would be bad news for the government ahead of the general election in 2006 . germany 's social democrats have their backs to the wall ahead of a key weekend election in a state they have held for nearly four decades , which could spell the beginning of the end for the government of chancellor gerhard schröder . schröder made a passionate plea to voters on friday to back his social democrats and their green coalition partners in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state with 18 million people . opinion polls show the social democrats are set to lose control of the state in sunday 's vote , after 39 years in charge - as disgruntled voters alarmed over a steady loss of jobs and erosion of social benefits head in droves to the opposition . defeat could spell bad omen for 2006 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder be walking away come 2006 ?
the state which forms the industrial heartland of germany appears almost certain to elect the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , an ominous sign for schröder as a general election looms in september 2006 .
defeat in the social democrat stronghold of 13.3 million voters would complete a miserable series of state election results for the chancellor . in 1999 , the spd governed in 11 of germany 's 16 regions but if it loses on sunday it will be in charge of only five . north rhine-westphalia is the only state ruled by a social democrat-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . schröder pleads with nrw for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , schröder told party supporters in dortmund that the state must stay loyal to its traditional politics .
" social democracy is the trademark of north rhine-westphalia and it must remain that way , " the chancellor said , flanked by spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero who had come to lend his support .
the federal government " needs the support of north rhine-westphalia , " schröder said , praising the state for its " social cohesion " . concerning the social security and labor market reforms that have improved competitiveness but swelled unemployment to 1.1 million in this region of coalmines and steelworks , schröder said they were a bitter pill germany must swallow .
" we must complete the overhaul of our social state , " he said .
" if we do not solve these problems we have no chance of staying among the top nations in the world . " unemployment has soared to around five million nationally and north rhine-westphalia has been particularly hard hit where in some areas close to one-quarter of the work force is jobless .
thirty years ago , coal and steel accounted for 830,000 jobs in the state , but now the figure is just 130,000 and as a result , unemployment in the most blighted areas is twice as high as the state average of 12 percent . opposition lead looks conclusive , says poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's jürgen rüttgers and his wife angelika on the campaign trail the conservative cdu is credited with 44 percent of the vote in north rhine-westphalia , ahead of the social democrats with 25 percent , the greens with nine percent and the liberal free democrats ' seven percent , according to a poll released by zdf public television . however the current state premier , peer steinbrueck , enjoys a high approval rating - 52 percent would back him if he were standing for direct election , against 30 percent for his conservative rival jürgen rüttgers , according to a poll published by ard public television . spd pins hopes on " undecided " voters steinbrueck , who admits on his campaign poster that he " can not promise jobs " , conceded on friday that " nationally , the overall trend is strongly against the spd " , but pointed to the large number of undecided voters as proof that the race was far from over . however , even if it takes north-rhine westphalia , the cdu will still lack the two-thirds majority in the federal upper chamber , or bundesrat , that would enable it to block the government 's decisions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear and confusion on the campaign trail the north rhine-westphalia state election has been the center of attention for weeks .

"
gracia tries to identify charitable persons unknown germany 's entry in the 50th eurovision song contest finished last with four votes as greece took the crown at the celebration of kitsch in kiev on saturday .
gracia 's song " run and hide " had voters turning off . germany 's eurovision song contest hopes were more than dashed on saturday night ; they were thrown to the floor and stamped on by every stiletto and cuban heel on show at the 50th gala of kitsch in kiev . gracia bauer , a former talent show also-ran who had courted controversy over her involvement in a chart-rigging scandal just weeks before the competition , garnered a woeful four points with her song " run and hide " .
it seemed like the voters took her words as sound advice as germany scored one of its lowest totals in the history of the competition . the dubious accolade of eurovision winner went to greece as singer helena paparizou thrashed the competition , triumphing over contestants from 23 other countries with her song " my number one . "
the news was greeted with scenes of joys in athens , where hundreds of people celebrated on the streets of the greek capital . greece celebrates eurovision victory in athens , paparizou fans , who had watched the contest on a giant screen late saturday in front of the zappeion palace , went wild when the greek victory was announced .
brandishing greek flags , they danced and embraced to the beat of " my number one , " written by christos dantis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " many congratulations to helena , " said athens mayor dora bakoyannis , who was on the scene .
" it 's a unique moment that we deserve ...
athens is ready to welcome eurovision in 2006 . " ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , who attended the songfest with his family , handed paparizou the eurovision award .
yushchenko handed paparizou a golden trophy inspired by jewels crafted by the scythians , an ancient people that once inhabited the territory of present-day ukraine . " this is a ukrainian prize for best european song , for europe 's best singer -lrb- handed -rrb- in the name of a united europe , " yushchenko said after giving paparizou a peck on the cheek . clad in a short golden dress , paparizou , who was born and raised in sweden , gave an energetic performance which included elements of a traditional greek national dance . paparizou , who was elected by television viewers from 39 countries , won with 230 points , 38 points ahead of malta 's chiara , who placed second with the song " angel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.05.2005 spd considers early election after defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader franz müntefering announces a possible early election the leadership of germany 's social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- met shortly after the damaging defeat in north rhine-westphalia and emerged soon after to declare it was considering calling an early federal election . german chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrats lost control of a key state on sunday , according to exit polls , and then proposed moving the general election forward to this year . the polls showed the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- suffered a heavy defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia where it had ruled for 39 years . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won 45 percent , comfortably ahead of the 37.2 percent for the spd , public tv said , shortly after polling stations closed . bitter defeat leads to emergency discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering spd chairman franz müntefering said it was a " bitter defeat " and immediately announced that his party would propose holding a general election late this year , around 12 months ahead of the scheduled date of september 2006 . " the chancellor and i have given notice that we will seek to hold general elections in the autumn , " müntefering said .
the party would discuss the proposal on monday but the final decision would have to be made by the bundestag lower house of parliament , he added . schröder added that the " bitter defeat " for the spd " throws into question " his ruling coalition 's ability to govern .
he was therefore in favour of holding a general election " in autumn this year " , one year ahead of the scheduled date . north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany with 18 million residents , was the last remaining state governed by a coalition of social democrats and greens , the so-called red-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . the defeat is the latest in a series of poor state election results for schröder 's party .
in 1999 , it governed in 11 of germany 's 16 states but is now in charge of only five . merkel hails sensational victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker kauder , left , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and chairwoman angela merkel , right , cheer in the party 's headquarters in berlin after a press conference following the announcement of exit polls of the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , sunday , may 22 , 2005 .
first exit polls predict a victory of the cdu .
the result is widely viewed as a strong indicator for next year 's national vote .
christian democrat leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schroeder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , hailed the outcome as " sensational " . " the voters have given the christian democratic union a sensational result , they have showed hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of early elections .
" every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " merkel said . new state premier rüttgers looks to fdp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers rüttgers , the cdu 's lead candidate in the state , had capitalized on the high unemployment rate in the heavily industrialized state where 1.1 million people are out of work , just over one fifth of the national total . a series of social security and labor market reforms introduced by schröder 's government have proved deeply unpopular with the spd 's traditional working-class voters .
that was reflected in what , if confirmed , would be its worst state election result in north rhine-westphalia for 51 years . the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , won 6.2 percent with the greens taking 6.0 percent , the exit polls showed . rüttgers said he would begin negotiations with the fdp as soon as possible with a view to forming a ruling coalition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .
-lrb- may 22 , 2005 -rrb- fear and confusion on the campaign trail the north rhine-westphalia state election has been the center of attention for weeks .

however , the islamic state is calling the summit " europe 's last chance " . the european union will try to coax iran back from the nuclear brink this week , warning tehran it could be hauled before the un security council if it carries out a threat to resume key atomic activities . the islamic state - suspected by the united states of wanting to build atomic weapons - is calling the meeting " the last chance for the europeans " to come up with something worth bargaining for . but the pressure on iran is multiplied by washington , waiting to direct its diplomatic fire straight at tehran if the eu talks fail .
" the bar for iran must be set very high because of its history of deception " in years of concealing its nuclear program , said nicholas burns , us under secretary for political affairs , last week . the talks will bring together iran 's top nuclear negotiators with the so-called eu-3 - the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , along with eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the exact timing and location of the talks is unclear , but diplomats say the most likely is a meeting of senior officials in brussels on tuesday before the full ministerial talks on wednesday in geneva . enrichment resumed after halt after suspending nuclear activities late last year , tehran recently said that it intends to resume some of the work it brought to a halt under an agreement reached with britain , france and germany last november . but tehran insists its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including enriching uranium , is aimed at generating electricity and is a right for a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . with tensions mounting , iranian negotiator hossein moussavian has raised the rhetoric to new levels .
he said last week that if the talks fail , uranium conversion work - a precursor to enrichment - being carried out at a plant near the central city of isfahan could restart before the presidential election on june 17 .
" the decision on resuming activities at isfahan is irreversible , " he said . carrot and stick approach ineffective so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dealing with iran 's clerical regime , the eu has held the carrot ; offering trade , security and technological incentives .
in the background , the united states has wielded the stick , leaving " all options on the table " although its more overt threats of the past have receded recently . in its letter on may 11 inviting iran back to the negotiating table , the eu warned the regime it could be heading into dangerous , uncharted territory .
" it would bring the negotiating process to an end .
the consequences beyond could only be negative for iran , " the letter from the eu three britain , france and germany read . europeans ponder vital next move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohsen mirdamadi , right , a reformist and who heads the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs and national security , talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , at iran 's parliament building in tehran .
despite these options , diplomats believe there is little room for maneuver .
" the europeans could try to put a bit more on the table , but they will not go back on their core demand , a halt in enrichment .
they have an agreement on this with the americans , and can not afford to go back , " said one . if iran resumes its suspended nuclear activities , the matter is likely to go first to the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog . from there , it would be sent to the un security council - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
given the need for consensus , with nations like russia and china , the council may just issue a warning . is stand-off an election tactic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a savvy pragmatist who has attempted to make contacts with the united states in the past , attends a press conference , after registering as a presidential candidate at the interior ministry in tehran , iran , wednesday , may 11 , 2005 .
iran 's presidential election will take place june 17 .
the unknown factor is how much the tensions can be put down to iranian electioneering .
amid the preparations for next month 's presidential poll , state television is running announcements selling the benefits of nuclear power to the public . according to dr ali ansari , at britain 's royal institute of international affairs , the regime has to appear tough before the poll .

"
gracia tries to identify charitable persons unknown germany 's entry in the 50th eurovision song contest finished last with four votes as greece took the crown at the celebration of kitsch in kiev on saturday .
gracia 's song " run and hide " had voters turning off . germany 's eurovision song contest hopes were more than dashed on saturday night ; they were thrown to the floor and stamped on by every stiletto and cuban heel on show at the 50th gala of kitsch in kiev . gracia bauer , a former talent show also-ran who had courted controversy over her involvement in a chart-rigging scandal just weeks before the competition , garnered a woeful four points with her song " run and hide " .
it seemed like the voters took her words as sound advice as germany scored one of its lowest totals in the history of the competition . the dubious accolade of eurovision winner went to greece as singer helena paparizou thrashed the competition , triumphing over contestants from 23 other countries with her song " my number one . "
the news was greeted with scenes of joys in athens , where hundreds of people celebrated on the streets of the greek capital . greece celebrates eurovision victory in athens , paparizou fans , who had watched the contest on a giant screen late saturday in front of the zappeion palace , went wild when the greek victory was announced .
brandishing greek flags , they danced and embraced to the beat of " my number one , " written by christos dantis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " many congratulations to helena , " said athens mayor dora bakoyannis , who was on the scene .
" it 's a unique moment that we deserve ...
athens is ready to welcome eurovision in 2006 . " ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , who attended the songfest with his family , handed paparizou the eurovision award .
yushchenko handed paparizou a golden trophy inspired by jewels crafted by the scythians , an ancient people that once inhabited the territory of present-day ukraine . " this is a ukrainian prize for best european song , for europe 's best singer -lrb- handed -rrb- in the name of a united europe , " yushchenko said after giving paparizou a peck on the cheek . clad in a short golden dress , paparizou , who was born and raised in sweden , gave an energetic performance which included elements of a traditional greek national dance . paparizou , who was elected by television viewers from 39 countries , won with 230 points , 38 points ahead of malta 's chiara , who placed second with the song " angel . "
romania 's luminita anghel and sistem placed third with " let me try . " controversy surrounds ukrainian song bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winner of eurovision 2004 ruslana lyzhychko with viktor yushchenko .
last year 's winner , ukraine 's ruslana , opened the competition with a performance of one of her songs , " fire " . this year 's ukrainian candidate , the greenjolly group , placed only 20th .
its selection to represent the former soviet republic had sparked controversy , as had its choice of song , " razom nas bahato " -lrb- together we are many -rrb- , the hymn sung by demonstrators against former president leonid kuchma 's regime in kiev 's independence square during last year 's " orange revolution . " greenjolly was largely unknown before the revolution and its last minute choice unleashed an avalanche of criticism of the new government which was accused of manipulating the vote that picked the group . to deflect criticism , greenjolly was obliged to modify the lyrics of the song , removing mention of the current president 's name . song contest a political opportunity ukraine 's authorities saw the eurovision contest as a way to showcase the country as 100 percent european , while yushchenko has made no secret of his hope to see kiev eventually join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine president viktor yushchenko has european designs " ukraine has always been a harmonious component of the -lrb- european -rrb- space , " the ukrainian leader said a few days before the songfest began .
" it has been made up not only by politicians , but also by peoples , their common values , their history and their culture .
these days in kiev , you will be able to feel this once more , " yushchenko said . the contest was held under tight security , as some 4,000 police stood by to make sure the 50th edition of the annual kitsch-fest did not get out of hand . before entering kiev 's sports palace , an arena capable of holding an audience of up to 8,000 , spectators had to submit to strict security checks and file under a metal detector . celebration of kitsch goes from strength to strength the eurovision song contest , first held in 1956 , is often associated with music of questionable merit , bizarre costumes and marked political bias in the voting .
yet all these elements have contributed to its enduring popularity . eurovision was a launch pad for the careers of such internationally famous performers as swedish disco group abba in the 1970s , or , later , french canadian singer celine dion , who represented switzerland , where she was living at the time . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politics and kitsch mix at eurovision as ukraine prepares to host this year 's eurovision song contest , it 's keen to present a new face to the world following last year 's " orange revolution .

" it 's wholly justified .
if we did not get the result we wanted we would not hesitate to use our veto , " the finance minister told bbc television . the british government rejects the eu proposals to freeze the annual budget rebate in 2007 and ultimately reduce it , arguing that it receives far less agricultural and regional development funding than its european counterparts . " it is the right thing to do because we get so little of the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- receipts , we get so little of the structural and cohesion funds receipts , that our rebate is wholly justified , " brown said . " i was at a meeting last saturday and made it absolutely clear that our rebate was wholly justified , " brown added , referring to the eu talks in luxembourg .
" jack straw is going -lrb- to the meeting in brussels -rrb- and he will make that absolutely clear as well . " straw to fight " unfairly high " demands straw said previously in march that his government was ready to use its veto to retain the long-cherished rebate - worth some three billion pounds -lrb- $ 5.5 billion , 4.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . the eu subsidies system has been modernized hugely since the rebate was first granted in 1984 - but london insists britain 's contribution to brussels would still be unfairly high without it . " the reason is because france , for example , is getting high amounts of agricultural subsidies receipts .
we do n't , " brown added .
" which means that without the rebate , there would be a gap which would mean that we would be paying far more than france , far more than italy , far more than other countries . " rebate preventing breakthrough on eu budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu finance ministers have been wrangling over the budget for months other brussels diplomats said that if it were not for the issue of britain 's rebate , the proposals by the luxembourg presidency could probably break a deadlock over the overall eu budget . " the presidency has done its work so well that technically it would not be very difficult to reach an agreement , " a french diplomat said .
" the real problem is the british rebate , " he added .
the french diplomat said that the problem was that successive british governments had lived on the rebate for 20 years and that the british were unlikely to budge .
for the british , " there is the crown and the check " he said . eu wants budget sorted before britain 's presidency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg , a veteran broker in eu affairs , wants an agreement to be struck at a summit in brussles of eu leaders on june 16 and 17 because otherwise the budget likely will languish once britain takes over the eu 's rotating presidency for six months in july . " if we want to get a political agreement , everybody around the table has to make sacrifices , but sacrifices that they can justify , " a luxembourg source said . the battle lines over the overall eu 's budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 are roughly drawn between the european commission which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . commission pushing for increased contributions luxembourg has proposed an overall budget for the eu in a range from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.085 trillion - $ 1.129 trillion -rrb- , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gross national income . the commission is angling for an eu budget of one trillion euros while the six main contributors have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gni . while putting the british rebate into question , the luxembourg proposals suggest that germany , the netherlands and sweden - the biggest contributors to the eu 's budget - should benefit from " specific measures " . taking a leaf out of margaret thatcher 's book , luxembourg proposals said such measures were justified because " no member state should sustain a budgetary burden which is excessive in relation to its relative prosperity " .
that was the same grounds thatcher originally based her argument for the rebate . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain protests eu budget plans british officials have labelled eu budget plans which would see britain 's € 4 billion rebate scrapped " unfair " after the european commission revealed the proposals for spending between 2007 and 2013 .
-lrb- july 17 , 2004 -rrb- britain in row with eu over budget rebate britain 's eu budget rebate could be cut after the european commission admitted it would debate plans to that effect in the coming weeks .
if approved , the u.k. would become the biggest net contributor of eu funds .
-lrb- july 8 , 2004 -rrb- budget to be focus of next eu presidency luxembourg , the next holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it will work to secure a compromise over the bloc 's long-term budget .
officials say failure to reach a deal could endanger the eu project .

" the chancellor and i have given notice that we will seek to hold general elections in the autumn , " müntefering said .
the party would discuss the proposal on monday but the final decision would have to be made by the bundestag lower house of parliament , he added . schröder added that the " bitter defeat " for the spd " throws into question " his ruling coalition 's ability to govern .
he was therefore in favour of holding a general election " in autumn this year " , one year ahead of the scheduled date . north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany with 18 million residents , was the last remaining state governed by a coalition of social democrats and greens , the so-called red-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . the defeat is the latest in a series of poor state election results for schröder 's party .
in 1999 , it governed in 11 of germany 's 16 states but is now in charge of only five . merkel hails sensational victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker kauder , left , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and chairwoman angela merkel , right , cheer in the party 's headquarters in berlin after a press conference following the announcement of exit polls of the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , sunday , may 22 , 2005 .
first exit polls predict a victory of the cdu .
the result is widely viewed as a strong indicator for next year 's national vote .
christian democrat leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schroeder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , hailed the outcome as " sensational " . " the voters have given the christian democratic union a sensational result , they have showed hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of early elections .
" every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " merkel said . new state premier rüttgers looks to fdp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers rüttgers , the cdu 's lead candidate in the state , had capitalized on the high unemployment rate in the heavily industrialized state where 1.1 million people are out of work , just over one fifth of the national total . a series of social security and labor market reforms introduced by schröder 's government have proved deeply unpopular with the spd 's traditional working-class voters .
that was reflected in what , if confirmed , would be its worst state election result in north rhine-westphalia for 51 years . the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , won 6.2 percent with the greens taking 6.0 percent , the exit polls showed . rüttgers said he would begin negotiations with the fdp as soon as possible with a view to forming a ruling coalition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .

however , the islamic state is calling the summit " europe 's last chance " . the european union will try to coax iran back from the nuclear brink this week , warning tehran it could be hauled before the un security council if it carries out a threat to resume key atomic activities . the islamic state - suspected by the united states of wanting to build atomic weapons - is calling the meeting " the last chance for the europeans " to come up with something worth bargaining for . but the pressure on iran is multiplied by washington , waiting to direct its diplomatic fire straight at tehran if the eu talks fail .
" the bar for iran must be set very high because of its history of deception " in years of concealing its nuclear program , said nicholas burns , us under secretary for political affairs , last week . the talks will bring together iran 's top nuclear negotiators with the so-called eu-3 - the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , along with eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the exact timing and location of the talks is unclear , but diplomats say the most likely is a meeting of senior officials in brussels on tuesday before the full ministerial talks on wednesday in geneva . enrichment resumed after halt after suspending nuclear activities late last year , tehran recently said that it intends to resume some of the work it brought to a halt under an agreement reached with britain , france and germany last november . but tehran insists its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including enriching uranium , is aimed at generating electricity and is a right for a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . with tensions mounting , iranian negotiator hossein moussavian has raised the rhetoric to new levels .
he said last week that if the talks fail , uranium conversion work - a precursor to enrichment - being carried out at a plant near the central city of isfahan could restart before the presidential election on june 17 .
" the decision on resuming activities at isfahan is irreversible , " he said . carrot and stick approach ineffective so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dealing with iran 's clerical regime , the eu has held the carrot ; offering trade , security and technological incentives .
in the background , the united states has wielded the stick , leaving " all options on the table " although its more overt threats of the past have receded recently . in its letter on may 11 inviting iran back to the negotiating table , the eu warned the regime it could be heading into dangerous , uncharted territory .
" it would bring the negotiating process to an end .
the consequences beyond could only be negative for iran , " the letter from the eu three britain , france and germany read . europeans ponder vital next move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohsen mirdamadi , right , a reformist and who heads the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs and national security , talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , at iran 's parliament building in tehran .
despite these options , diplomats believe there is little room for maneuver .
" the europeans could try to put a bit more on the table , but they will not go back on their core demand , a halt in enrichment .
they have an agreement on this with the americans , and can not afford to go back , " said one . if iran resumes its suspended nuclear activities , the matter is likely to go first to the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog . from there , it would be sent to the un security council - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
given the need for consensus , with nations like russia and china , the council may just issue a warning . is stand-off an election tactic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a savvy pragmatist who has attempted to make contacts with the united states in the past , attends a press conference , after registering as a presidential candidate at the interior ministry in tehran , iran , wednesday , may 11 , 2005 .
iran 's presidential election will take place june 17 .
the unknown factor is how much the tensions can be put down to iranian electioneering .
amid the preparations for next month 's presidential poll , state television is running announcements selling the benefits of nuclear power to the public . according to dr ali ansari , at britain 's royal institute of international affairs , the regime has to appear tough before the poll .
" i think that nothing really substantial is going to happen until the iranian elections are over , " he said .

however , while following his predecessor 's line so far , questions remain about his own future plans . a month into his pontificate , benedict xvi has confirmed the broad diplomatic and theological lines of his predecessor john paul ii but has left few clues as to how he intends to make his own mark as head of the roman catholic church . once-cardinal joseph ratzinger , known for his conservative stance as the vatican 's guardian of dogma , pope benedict has concentrated since his election on april 19 on reassuring and coming to grips with the church and public opinion before presenting his own vision of the future . " my real program of governance is not to do my own will , not to pursue my own ideas , but to listen , together with the whole church , to the word and the will of the lord , " the 78-year-old benedict xvi said at his inauguration mass . hints at future plans but no concrete action as yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has nonetheless given hints into which issues he plans to address : opening ties with communist china , engaging in ecumenical dialogue , pursuing improved relations with jews and dialogue with islam and other religions . many are now waiting to see whether these initial declarations of intent will turn into concrete action . contacts between the vatican and beijing have multiplied since the death of polish-born john paul ii , but they have been led by the rome-based catholic community of sant 'egidio and will eventually have to be taken over by the diplomats of the holy see .
there are no formal ties between china and the vatican city-state . regarding christian unity , the pope can also benefit from the recent rapprochement between catholic and anglican theologians on marian practices , which have divided the churches for 500 years . but the true test will be whether he is able to improve ties with russia 's orthodox church , which john paul ii was unable to achieve before his death on april 2 . reconciliation work to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emeritus chief rabbi of rome elio toaff is seen greeting pope john paul ii after a concert in the paul vi hall at the vatican , on jan .
17 , 2004 .
german-born benedict xvi has vowed to pursue the work of reconciliation with judaism launched by pope john paul , and plans a historic visit to the synagogue of cologne when he travels to the german city of the world youth days in august . in just a month in office , the pope can already count at least one success : improving his image as a stern vatican watchdog . according to a poll published in italy 's la repubblica daily tuesday , 78 percent of italians have a good opinion of the pope , although they do not expect him to carry out the changes they wish to see in the church 's positions on contraception , abortion and assisted procreation . hard line still in evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new pope has in fact reaffirmed the church 's insistence on the sacred nature of all human life from conception to natural death , calling abortion murder and indicating that the " preservation of life " would be a central theme of his pontificate . he has also underlined the catholic church 's universal vocation to break through the barriers of racism and class divisions and cross the borders between peoples - key themes of the church 's progressive wing . in addressing all these issues , the pope has repeatedly evoked his human fragility as " simple and humble laborer in the vineyard of the lord . " benedict coming to terms with public persona coming after the 26-year rule of charismatic and media-savvy john paul ii , benedict xvi appears to be a reserved man .
although he seems to be relaxing as the weeks go by in his contact with the faithful , vatican observers consider him more of an intellectual pope than outgoing political figure . the pope has distanced himself from more popular forms of piety encouraged by john paul ii , although he seemingly gave in to popular pressure to skip a five-year wait before launching the beatification procedure for pope john paul . contrary to his predecessor , for example , benedict xvi has chosen not to preside over all beatification ceremonies . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de john paul ii on fast track to sainthood pope benedict xvi announced on friday that he had started the process to beatify his predecessor john paul ii , dispensing with rules that require a five-year waiting period before the sainthood procedure can start .

" but it 's not my right to condemn these men and women , these teenagers and children a second or third time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.05.2005 one month on , pope 's plans still unknown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has yet to stamp his own identity on the papacy since taking office last month , pope benedict xvi has worked hard to reassure and stabilize the catholic church .
however , while following his predecessor 's line so far , questions remain about his own future plans . a month into his pontificate , benedict xvi has confirmed the broad diplomatic and theological lines of his predecessor john paul ii but has left few clues as to how he intends to make his own mark as head of the roman catholic church . once-cardinal joseph ratzinger , known for his conservative stance as the vatican 's guardian of dogma , pope benedict has concentrated since his election on april 19 on reassuring and coming to grips with the church and public opinion before presenting his own vision of the future . " my real program of governance is not to do my own will , not to pursue my own ideas , but to listen , together with the whole church , to the word and the will of the lord , " the 78-year-old benedict xvi said at his inauguration mass . hints at future plans but no concrete action as yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has nonetheless given hints into which issues he plans to address : opening ties with communist china , engaging in ecumenical dialogue , pursuing improved relations with jews and dialogue with islam and other religions . many are now waiting to see whether these initial declarations of intent will turn into concrete action . contacts between the vatican and beijing have multiplied since the death of polish-born john paul ii , but they have been led by the rome-based catholic community of sant 'egidio and will eventually have to be taken over by the diplomats of the holy see .
there are no formal ties between china and the vatican city-state . regarding christian unity , the pope can also benefit from the recent rapprochement between catholic and anglican theologians on marian practices , which have divided the churches for 500 years . but the true test will be whether he is able to improve ties with russia 's orthodox church , which john paul ii was unable to achieve before his death on april 2 . reconciliation work to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emeritus chief rabbi of rome elio toaff is seen greeting pope john paul ii after a concert in the paul vi hall at the vatican , on jan .
17 , 2004 .
german-born benedict xvi has vowed to pursue the work of reconciliation with judaism launched by pope john paul , and plans a historic visit to the synagogue of cologne when he travels to the german city of the world youth days in august . in just a month in office , the pope can already count at least one success : improving his image as a stern vatican watchdog . according to a poll published in italy 's la repubblica daily tuesday , 78 percent of italians have a good opinion of the pope , although they do not expect him to carry out the changes they wish to see in the church 's positions on contraception , abortion and assisted procreation . hard line still in evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new pope has in fact reaffirmed the church 's insistence on the sacred nature of all human life from conception to natural death , calling abortion murder and indicating that the " preservation of life " would be a central theme of his pontificate . he has also underlined the catholic church 's universal vocation to break through the barriers of racism and class divisions and cross the borders between peoples - key themes of the church 's progressive wing . in addressing all these issues , the pope has repeatedly evoked his human fragility as " simple and humble laborer in the vineyard of the lord . " benedict coming to terms with public persona coming after the 26-year rule of charismatic and media-savvy john paul ii , benedict xvi appears to be a reserved man .
although he seems to be relaxing as the weeks go by in his contact with the faithful , vatican observers consider him more of an intellectual pope than outgoing political figure . the pope has distanced himself from more popular forms of piety encouraged by john paul ii , although he seemingly gave in to popular pressure to skip a five-year wait before launching the beatification procedure for pope john paul . contrary to his predecessor , for example , benedict xvi has chosen not to preside over all beatification ceremonies . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de john paul ii on fast track to sainthood pope benedict xvi announced on friday that he had started the process to beatify his predecessor john paul ii , dispensing with rules that require a five-year waiting period before the sainthood procedure can start .

"
gracia tries to identify charitable persons unknown germany 's entry in the 50th eurovision song contest finished last with four votes as greece took the crown at the celebration of kitsch in kiev on saturday .
gracia 's song " run and hide " had voters turning off . germany 's eurovision song contest hopes were more than dashed on saturday night ; they were thrown to the floor and stamped on by every stiletto and cuban heel on show at the 50th gala of kitsch in kiev . gracia bauer , a former talent show also-ran who had courted controversy over her involvement in a chart-rigging scandal just weeks before the competition , garnered a woeful four points with her song " run and hide " .
it seemed like the voters took her words as sound advice as germany scored one of its lowest totals in the history of the competition . the dubious accolade of eurovision winner went to greece as singer helena paparizou thrashed the competition , triumphing over contestants from 23 other countries with her song " my number one . "
the news was greeted with scenes of joys in athens , where hundreds of people celebrated on the streets of the greek capital . greece celebrates eurovision victory in athens , paparizou fans , who had watched the contest on a giant screen late saturday in front of the zappeion palace , went wild when the greek victory was announced .
brandishing greek flags , they danced and embraced to the beat of " my number one , " written by christos dantis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " many congratulations to helena , " said athens mayor dora bakoyannis , who was on the scene .
" it 's a unique moment that we deserve ...
athens is ready to welcome eurovision in 2006 . " ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , who attended the songfest with his family , handed paparizou the eurovision award .
yushchenko handed paparizou a golden trophy inspired by jewels crafted by the scythians , an ancient people that once inhabited the territory of present-day ukraine . " this is a ukrainian prize for best european song , for europe 's best singer -lrb- handed -rrb- in the name of a united europe , " yushchenko said after giving paparizou a peck on the cheek . clad in a short golden dress , paparizou , who was born and raised in sweden , gave an energetic performance which included elements of a traditional greek national dance . paparizou , who was elected by television viewers from 39 countries , won with 230 points , 38 points ahead of malta 's chiara , who placed second with the song " angel . "
romania 's luminita anghel and sistem placed third with " let me try . " controversy surrounds ukrainian song bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winner of eurovision 2004 ruslana lyzhychko with viktor yushchenko .
last year 's winner , ukraine 's ruslana , opened the competition with a performance of one of her songs , " fire " . this year 's ukrainian candidate , the greenjolly group , placed only 20th .
its selection to represent the former soviet republic had sparked controversy , as had its choice of song , " razom nas bahato " -lrb- together we are many -rrb- , the hymn sung by demonstrators against former president leonid kuchma 's regime in kiev 's independence square during last year 's " orange revolution . " greenjolly was largely unknown before the revolution and its last minute choice unleashed an avalanche of criticism of the new government which was accused of manipulating the vote that picked the group . to deflect criticism , greenjolly was obliged to modify the lyrics of the song , removing mention of the current president 's name . song contest a political opportunity ukraine 's authorities saw the eurovision contest as a way to showcase the country as 100 percent european , while yushchenko has made no secret of his hope to see kiev eventually join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine president viktor yushchenko has european designs " ukraine has always been a harmonious component of the -lrb- european -rrb- space , " the ukrainian leader said a few days before the songfest began .
" it has been made up not only by politicians , but also by peoples , their common values , their history and their culture .
these days in kiev , you will be able to feel this once more , " yushchenko said . the contest was held under tight security , as some 4,000 police stood by to make sure the 50th edition of the annual kitsch-fest did not get out of hand . before entering kiev 's sports palace , an arena capable of holding an audience of up to 8,000 , spectators had to submit to strict security checks and file under a metal detector . celebration of kitsch goes from strength to strength the eurovision song contest , first held in 1956 , is often associated with music of questionable merit , bizarre costumes and marked political bias in the voting .
yet all these elements have contributed to its enduring popularity . eurovision was a launch pad for the careers of such internationally famous performers as swedish disco group abba in the 1970s , or , later , french canadian singer celine dion , who represented switzerland , where she was living at the time . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politics and kitsch mix at eurovision as ukraine prepares to host this year 's eurovision song contest , it 's keen to present a new face to the world following last year 's " orange revolution .

however , the islamic state is calling the summit " europe 's last chance " . the european union will try to coax iran back from the nuclear brink this week , warning tehran it could be hauled before the un security council if it carries out a threat to resume key atomic activities . the islamic state - suspected by the united states of wanting to build atomic weapons - is calling the meeting " the last chance for the europeans " to come up with something worth bargaining for . but the pressure on iran is multiplied by washington , waiting to direct its diplomatic fire straight at tehran if the eu talks fail .
" the bar for iran must be set very high because of its history of deception " in years of concealing its nuclear program , said nicholas burns , us under secretary for political affairs , last week . the talks will bring together iran 's top nuclear negotiators with the so-called eu-3 - the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , along with eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the exact timing and location of the talks is unclear , but diplomats say the most likely is a meeting of senior officials in brussels on tuesday before the full ministerial talks on wednesday in geneva . enrichment resumed after halt after suspending nuclear activities late last year , tehran recently said that it intends to resume some of the work it brought to a halt under an agreement reached with britain , france and germany last november . but tehran insists its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including enriching uranium , is aimed at generating electricity and is a right for a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . with tensions mounting , iranian negotiator hossein moussavian has raised the rhetoric to new levels .
he said last week that if the talks fail , uranium conversion work - a precursor to enrichment - being carried out at a plant near the central city of isfahan could restart before the presidential election on june 17 .
" the decision on resuming activities at isfahan is irreversible , " he said . carrot and stick approach ineffective so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dealing with iran 's clerical regime , the eu has held the carrot ; offering trade , security and technological incentives .
in the background , the united states has wielded the stick , leaving " all options on the table " although its more overt threats of the past have receded recently . in its letter on may 11 inviting iran back to the negotiating table , the eu warned the regime it could be heading into dangerous , uncharted territory .
" it would bring the negotiating process to an end .
the consequences beyond could only be negative for iran , " the letter from the eu three britain , france and germany read . europeans ponder vital next move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohsen mirdamadi , right , a reformist and who heads the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs and national security , talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , at iran 's parliament building in tehran .
despite these options , diplomats believe there is little room for maneuver .

" the chancellor and i have given notice that we will seek to hold general elections in the autumn , " müntefering said .
the party would discuss the proposal on monday but the final decision would have to be made by the bundestag lower house of parliament , he added . schröder added that the " bitter defeat " for the spd " throws into question " his ruling coalition 's ability to govern .
he was therefore in favour of holding a general election " in autumn this year " , one year ahead of the scheduled date . north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany with 18 million residents , was the last remaining state governed by a coalition of social democrats and greens , the so-called red-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . the defeat is the latest in a series of poor state election results for schröder 's party .
in 1999 , it governed in 11 of germany 's 16 states but is now in charge of only five . merkel hails sensational victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker kauder , left , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and chairwoman angela merkel , right , cheer in the party 's headquarters in berlin after a press conference following the announcement of exit polls of the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , sunday , may 22 , 2005 .
first exit polls predict a victory of the cdu .
the result is widely viewed as a strong indicator for next year 's national vote .
christian democrat leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schroeder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , hailed the outcome as " sensational " . " the voters have given the christian democratic union a sensational result , they have showed hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of early elections .
" every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " merkel said . new state premier rüttgers looks to fdp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers rüttgers , the cdu 's lead candidate in the state , had capitalized on the high unemployment rate in the heavily industrialized state where 1.1 million people are out of work , just over one fifth of the national total . a series of social security and labor market reforms introduced by schröder 's government have proved deeply unpopular with the spd 's traditional working-class voters .
that was reflected in what , if confirmed , would be its worst state election result in north rhine-westphalia for 51 years . the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , won 6.2 percent with the greens taking 6.0 percent , the exit polls showed . rüttgers said he would begin negotiations with the fdp as soon as possible with a view to forming a ruling coalition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .

however , the islamic state is calling the summit " europe 's last chance " . the european union will try to coax iran back from the nuclear brink this week , warning tehran it could be hauled before the un security council if it carries out a threat to resume key atomic activities . the islamic state - suspected by the united states of wanting to build atomic weapons - is calling the meeting " the last chance for the europeans " to come up with something worth bargaining for . but the pressure on iran is multiplied by washington , waiting to direct its diplomatic fire straight at tehran if the eu talks fail .
" the bar for iran must be set very high because of its history of deception " in years of concealing its nuclear program , said nicholas burns , us under secretary for political affairs , last week . the talks will bring together iran 's top nuclear negotiators with the so-called eu-3 - the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , along with eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the exact timing and location of the talks is unclear , but diplomats say the most likely is a meeting of senior officials in brussels on tuesday before the full ministerial talks on wednesday in geneva . enrichment resumed after halt after suspending nuclear activities late last year , tehran recently said that it intends to resume some of the work it brought to a halt under an agreement reached with britain , france and germany last november . but tehran insists its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including enriching uranium , is aimed at generating electricity and is a right for a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . with tensions mounting , iranian negotiator hossein moussavian has raised the rhetoric to new levels .
he said last week that if the talks fail , uranium conversion work - a precursor to enrichment - being carried out at a plant near the central city of isfahan could restart before the presidential election on june 17 .
" the decision on resuming activities at isfahan is irreversible , " he said . carrot and stick approach ineffective so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dealing with iran 's clerical regime , the eu has held the carrot ; offering trade , security and technological incentives .
in the background , the united states has wielded the stick , leaving " all options on the table " although its more overt threats of the past have receded recently . in its letter on may 11 inviting iran back to the negotiating table , the eu warned the regime it could be heading into dangerous , uncharted territory .
" it would bring the negotiating process to an end .
the consequences beyond could only be negative for iran , " the letter from the eu three britain , france and germany read . europeans ponder vital next move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohsen mirdamadi , right , a reformist and who heads the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs and national security , talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , at iran 's parliament building in tehran .
despite these options , diplomats believe there is little room for maneuver .
" the europeans could try to put a bit more on the table , but they will not go back on their core demand , a halt in enrichment .
they have an agreement on this with the americans , and can not afford to go back , " said one . if iran resumes its suspended nuclear activities , the matter is likely to go first to the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog . from there , it would be sent to the un security council - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
given the need for consensus , with nations like russia and china , the council may just issue a warning . is stand-off an election tactic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a savvy pragmatist who has attempted to make contacts with the united states in the past , attends a press conference , after registering as a presidential candidate at the interior ministry in tehran , iran , wednesday , may 11 , 2005 .

however , the islamic state is calling the summit " europe 's last chance " . the european union will try to coax iran back from the nuclear brink this week , warning tehran it could be hauled before the un security council if it carries out a threat to resume key atomic activities . the islamic state - suspected by the united states of wanting to build atomic weapons - is calling the meeting " the last chance for the europeans " to come up with something worth bargaining for . but the pressure on iran is multiplied by washington , waiting to direct its diplomatic fire straight at tehran if the eu talks fail .
" the bar for iran must be set very high because of its history of deception " in years of concealing its nuclear program , said nicholas burns , us under secretary for political affairs , last week . the talks will bring together iran 's top nuclear negotiators with the so-called eu-3 - the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , along with eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the exact timing and location of the talks is unclear , but diplomats say the most likely is a meeting of senior officials in brussels on tuesday before the full ministerial talks on wednesday in geneva . enrichment resumed after halt after suspending nuclear activities late last year , tehran recently said that it intends to resume some of the work it brought to a halt under an agreement reached with britain , france and germany last november . but tehran insists its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including enriching uranium , is aimed at generating electricity and is a right for a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . with tensions mounting , iranian negotiator hossein moussavian has raised the rhetoric to new levels .
he said last week that if the talks fail , uranium conversion work - a precursor to enrichment - being carried out at a plant near the central city of isfahan could restart before the presidential election on june 17 .
" the decision on resuming activities at isfahan is irreversible , " he said . carrot and stick approach ineffective so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dealing with iran 's clerical regime , the eu has held the carrot ; offering trade , security and technological incentives .
in the background , the united states has wielded the stick , leaving " all options on the table " although its more overt threats of the past have receded recently . in its letter on may 11 inviting iran back to the negotiating table , the eu warned the regime it could be heading into dangerous , uncharted territory .

despite these options , diplomats believe there is little room for maneuver .
" the europeans could try to put a bit more on the table , but they will not go back on their core demand , a halt in enrichment .
they have an agreement on this with the americans , and can not afford to go back , " said one . if iran resumes its suspended nuclear activities , the matter is likely to go first to the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog . from there , it would be sent to the un security council - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .

that was reflected in what , if confirmed , would be its worst state election result in north rhine-westphalia for 51 years . the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , won 6.2 percent with the greens taking 6.0 percent , the exit polls showed . rüttgers said he would begin negotiations with the fdp as soon as possible with a view to forming a ruling coalition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .

however , the islamic state is calling the summit " europe 's last chance " . the european union will try to coax iran back from the nuclear brink this week , warning tehran it could be hauled before the un security council if it carries out a threat to resume key atomic activities . the islamic state - suspected by the united states of wanting to build atomic weapons - is calling the meeting " the last chance for the europeans " to come up with something worth bargaining for . but the pressure on iran is multiplied by washington , waiting to direct its diplomatic fire straight at tehran if the eu talks fail .
" the bar for iran must be set very high because of its history of deception " in years of concealing its nuclear program , said nicholas burns , us under secretary for political affairs , last week . the talks will bring together iran 's top nuclear negotiators with the so-called eu-3 - the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , along with eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the exact timing and location of the talks is unclear , but diplomats say the most likely is a meeting of senior officials in brussels on tuesday before the full ministerial talks on wednesday in geneva . enrichment resumed after halt after suspending nuclear activities late last year , tehran recently said that it intends to resume some of the work it brought to a halt under an agreement reached with britain , france and germany last november . but tehran insists its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including enriching uranium , is aimed at generating electricity and is a right for a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . with tensions mounting , iranian negotiator hossein moussavian has raised the rhetoric to new levels .
he said last week that if the talks fail , uranium conversion work - a precursor to enrichment - being carried out at a plant near the central city of isfahan could restart before the presidential election on june 17 .
" the decision on resuming activities at isfahan is irreversible , " he said . carrot and stick approach ineffective so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dealing with iran 's clerical regime , the eu has held the carrot ; offering trade , security and technological incentives .
in the background , the united states has wielded the stick , leaving " all options on the table " although its more overt threats of the past have receded recently . in its letter on may 11 inviting iran back to the negotiating table , the eu warned the regime it could be heading into dangerous , uncharted territory .
" it would bring the negotiating process to an end .
the consequences beyond could only be negative for iran , " the letter from the eu three britain , france and germany read . europeans ponder vital next move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohsen mirdamadi , right , a reformist and who heads the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs and national security , talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , at iran 's parliament building in tehran .
despite these options , diplomats believe there is little room for maneuver .
" the europeans could try to put a bit more on the table , but they will not go back on their core demand , a halt in enrichment .
they have an agreement on this with the americans , and can not afford to go back , " said one . if iran resumes its suspended nuclear activities , the matter is likely to go first to the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog . from there , it would be sent to the un security council - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
given the need for consensus , with nations like russia and china , the council may just issue a warning . is stand-off an election tactic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a savvy pragmatist who has attempted to make contacts with the united states in the past , attends a press conference , after registering as a presidential candidate at the interior ministry in tehran , iran , wednesday , may 11 , 2005 .
iran 's presidential election will take place june 17 .
the unknown factor is how much the tensions can be put down to iranian electioneering .
amid the preparations for next month 's presidential poll , state television is running announcements selling the benefits of nuclear power to the public . according to dr ali ansari , at britain 's royal institute of international affairs , the regime has to appear tough before the poll .

" the chancellor and i have given notice that we will seek to hold general elections in the autumn , " müntefering said .
the party would discuss the proposal on monday but the final decision would have to be made by the bundestag lower house of parliament , he added . schröder added that the " bitter defeat " for the spd " throws into question " his ruling coalition 's ability to govern .
he was therefore in favour of holding a general election " in autumn this year " , one year ahead of the scheduled date . north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany with 18 million residents , was the last remaining state governed by a coalition of social democrats and greens , the so-called red-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . the defeat is the latest in a series of poor state election results for schröder 's party .
in 1999 , it governed in 11 of germany 's 16 states but is now in charge of only five . merkel hails sensational victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker kauder , left , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and chairwoman angela merkel , right , cheer in the party 's headquarters in berlin after a press conference following the announcement of exit polls of the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , sunday , may 22 , 2005 .
first exit polls predict a victory of the cdu .
the result is widely viewed as a strong indicator for next year 's national vote .
christian democrat leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schroeder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , hailed the outcome as " sensational " . " the voters have given the christian democratic union a sensational result , they have showed hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of early elections .
" every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " merkel said . new state premier rüttgers looks to fdp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers rüttgers , the cdu 's lead candidate in the state , had capitalized on the high unemployment rate in the heavily industrialized state where 1.1 million people are out of work , just over one fifth of the national total . a series of social security and labor market reforms introduced by schröder 's government have proved deeply unpopular with the spd 's traditional working-class voters .
that was reflected in what , if confirmed , would be its worst state election result in north rhine-westphalia for 51 years . the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , won 6.2 percent with the greens taking 6.0 percent , the exit polls showed . rüttgers said he would begin negotiations with the fdp as soon as possible with a view to forming a ruling coalition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .

" it 's wholly justified .
if we did not get the result we wanted we would not hesitate to use our veto , " the finance minister told bbc television . the british government rejects the eu proposals to freeze the annual budget rebate in 2007 and ultimately reduce it , arguing that it receives far less agricultural and regional development funding than its european counterparts . " it is the right thing to do because we get so little of the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- receipts , we get so little of the structural and cohesion funds receipts , that our rebate is wholly justified , " brown said . " i was at a meeting last saturday and made it absolutely clear that our rebate was wholly justified , " brown added , referring to the eu talks in luxembourg .
" jack straw is going -lrb- to the meeting in brussels -rrb- and he will make that absolutely clear as well . " straw to fight " unfairly high " demands straw said previously in march that his government was ready to use its veto to retain the long-cherished rebate - worth some three billion pounds -lrb- $ 5.5 billion , 4.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . the eu subsidies system has been modernized hugely since the rebate was first granted in 1984 - but london insists britain 's contribution to brussels would still be unfairly high without it . " the reason is because france , for example , is getting high amounts of agricultural subsidies receipts .
we do n't , " brown added .
" which means that without the rebate , there would be a gap which would mean that we would be paying far more than france , far more than italy , far more than other countries . " rebate preventing breakthrough on eu budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu finance ministers have been wrangling over the budget for months other brussels diplomats said that if it were not for the issue of britain 's rebate , the proposals by the luxembourg presidency could probably break a deadlock over the overall eu budget . " the presidency has done its work so well that technically it would not be very difficult to reach an agreement , " a french diplomat said .
" the real problem is the british rebate , " he added .
the french diplomat said that the problem was that successive british governments had lived on the rebate for 20 years and that the british were unlikely to budge .
for the british , " there is the crown and the check " he said . eu wants budget sorted before britain 's presidency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg , a veteran broker in eu affairs , wants an agreement to be struck at a summit in brussles of eu leaders on june 16 and 17 because otherwise the budget likely will languish once britain takes over the eu 's rotating presidency for six months in july . " if we want to get a political agreement , everybody around the table has to make sacrifices , but sacrifices that they can justify , " a luxembourg source said . the battle lines over the overall eu 's budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 are roughly drawn between the european commission which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . commission pushing for increased contributions luxembourg has proposed an overall budget for the eu in a range from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.085 trillion - $ 1.129 trillion -rrb- , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gross national income . the commission is angling for an eu budget of one trillion euros while the six main contributors have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gni . while putting the british rebate into question , the luxembourg proposals suggest that germany , the netherlands and sweden - the biggest contributors to the eu 's budget - should benefit from " specific measures " . taking a leaf out of margaret thatcher 's book , luxembourg proposals said such measures were justified because " no member state should sustain a budgetary burden which is excessive in relation to its relative prosperity " .

traveling around the globe for a year and visiting 60 countries along the way might be a dream for many .
but the " hotels " jan de cock stayed at during his trip would surely deter most people : prisons . spending time in an overcrowded african prison is not something to aspire to .
but for de cock , it was an experience he had dreamt about for a long time . for the past 20 years , the belgian has been interested in the fate of prisoners , who are often forgotten by the rest of society . " let me make clear that i 'm for justice and for punishing criminals , " he said .
" but it 's not my right to condemn these men and women , these teenagers and children a second or third time .
i want to show these people in a different light .
they 're people just like us . " it was n't easy for de cock to convince officials to let him stay in a prison for a few days and nights just like regular inmates .
it took him three years and hundreds of letters to embassies , ministries and prison directors to prepare for the journey . sleeping with rats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners inside a prison in cotnonou , benin in the end , he received permission to stay at 66 prisons around the globe - some in democratic countries , others run by dictatorial regimes . " the first prison i slept at was in kigali in ruwanda , " he said , adding that the prison , which was built for 2,000 inmates , housed 7,000 people . " i was wedged between fellow inmates , " he said .
" below the beds , where i keep my slippers at home , lay three or four more prisoners .
i remember that i woke up in the middle of the night because something was crawling through my hair .
it was my first encounter with a giant rat . " choosing benin over us de cock said he does believe that prisons reflect a country 's political system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates in a privately-run prison in nevada " you can tell the level of democracy that exists in a country by the way prisoners are dealt with , " he said , adding that democracies do n't always treat their prisoners more humanely . " if you 'd present me with a choice to stay in a clean prison in the us or under miserable conditions as is the case in -lrb- benin 's -rrb- coutonou prison , where 250 people share a room built for 50 , i think i 'd choose the latter , " he said .
" people keep each other alive if they can be together , even if the situation is horrible . " similarities despite regional differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isolation is the worst kind of punishment , de cock said , adding that japan is especially harsh with prisoners .
there , inmates are told in which position they have to sleep .
they are not allowed to talk .
they must n't look guards in the eye . scandinavian prisons on the other hand try to prepare prisoners for their re-entry into society .
in latin america , de cock was surprised by the extreme corruption that exists in prisons there . but despite regional differences , prisoners resemble each other in many ways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners in a cell at moscow 's 18th-century butyrka prison " the thing that hit me most was the extreme sense of abandonment felt by these people , " he said .
" i remember the case of a women in a prison in peru , lima .
when she was released after 27 years behind bars , she came back three days later and begged to be readmitted .
she did n't know anyone on the outside any more . " learning from inmates de cock heard many similar stories during his visits .
in many cases , he was the first person to show any interest in inmates for years , he said . " the more you enter this world , the more you realize that nice things happen there as well , " he said .
" you realize that these people that have been condemned by society can teach us something as well - about trust , about patience and solidarity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates at guantanamo bay prison trying to share his experiences with others , de cock has written a book , " hotel prison , " about his book .

traveling around the globe for a year and visiting 60 countries along the way might be a dream for many .
but the " hotels " jan de cock stayed at during his trip would surely deter most people : prisons . spending time in an overcrowded african prison is not something to aspire to .
but for de cock , it was an experience he had dreamt about for a long time . for the past 20 years , the belgian has been interested in the fate of prisoners , who are often forgotten by the rest of society . " let me make clear that i 'm for justice and for punishing criminals , " he said .
" but it 's not my right to condemn these men and women , these teenagers and children a second or third time .
i want to show these people in a different light .
they 're people just like us . " it was n't easy for de cock to convince officials to let him stay in a prison for a few days and nights just like regular inmates .
it took him three years and hundreds of letters to embassies , ministries and prison directors to prepare for the journey . sleeping with rats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners inside a prison in cotnonou , benin in the end , he received permission to stay at 66 prisons around the globe - some in democratic countries , others run by dictatorial regimes . " the first prison i slept at was in kigali in ruwanda , " he said , adding that the prison , which was built for 2,000 inmates , housed 7,000 people . " i was wedged between fellow inmates , " he said .
" below the beds , where i keep my slippers at home , lay three or four more prisoners .
i remember that i woke up in the middle of the night because something was crawling through my hair .
it was my first encounter with a giant rat . " choosing benin over us de cock said he does believe that prisons reflect a country 's political system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates in a privately-run prison in nevada " you can tell the level of democracy that exists in a country by the way prisoners are dealt with , " he said , adding that democracies do n't always treat their prisoners more humanely . " if you 'd present me with a choice to stay in a clean prison in the us or under miserable conditions as is the case in -lrb- benin 's -rrb- coutonou prison , where 250 people share a room built for 50 , i think i 'd choose the latter , " he said .
" people keep each other alive if they can be together , even if the situation is horrible . " similarities despite regional differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isolation is the worst kind of punishment , de cock said , adding that japan is especially harsh with prisoners .
there , inmates are told in which position they have to sleep .
they are not allowed to talk .
they must n't look guards in the eye . scandinavian prisons on the other hand try to prepare prisoners for their re-entry into society .
in latin america , de cock was surprised by the extreme corruption that exists in prisons there . but despite regional differences , prisoners resemble each other in many ways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners in a cell at moscow 's 18th-century butyrka prison " the thing that hit me most was the extreme sense of abandonment felt by these people , " he said .
" i remember the case of a women in a prison in peru , lima .
when she was released after 27 years behind bars , she came back three days later and begged to be readmitted .
she did n't know anyone on the outside any more . " learning from inmates de cock heard many similar stories during his visits .
in many cases , he was the first person to show any interest in inmates for years , he said . " the more you enter this world , the more you realize that nice things happen there as well , " he said .
" you realize that these people that have been condemned by society can teach us something as well - about trust , about patience and solidarity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates at guantanamo bay prison trying to share his experiences with others , de cock has written a book , " hotel prison , " about his book .
he 's also planning to continue his journey , he said .
" i 'd like to take a look at guantanamo bay , " he said , adding that iraq 's abu ghraib prison is also on his list . christiane wolters -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's graying gangsters criminality among german senior citizens is on the rise .

an spd defeat would be bad news for the government ahead of the general election in 2006 . germany 's social democrats have their backs to the wall ahead of a key weekend election in a state they have held for nearly four decades , which could spell the beginning of the end for the government of chancellor gerhard schröder . schröder made a passionate plea to voters on friday to back his social democrats and their green coalition partners in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state with 18 million people . opinion polls show the social democrats are set to lose control of the state in sunday 's vote , after 39 years in charge - as disgruntled voters alarmed over a steady loss of jobs and erosion of social benefits head in droves to the opposition . defeat could spell bad omen for 2006 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder be walking away come 2006 ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.05.2005 spd considers early election after defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader franz müntefering announces a possible early election the leadership of germany 's social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- met shortly after the damaging defeat in north rhine-westphalia and emerged soon after to declare it was considering calling an early federal election . german chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrats lost control of a key state on sunday , according to exit polls , and then proposed moving the general election forward to this year . the polls showed the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- suffered a heavy defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia where it had ruled for 39 years . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won 45 percent , comfortably ahead of the 37.2 percent for the spd , public tv said , shortly after polling stations closed . bitter defeat leads to emergency discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering spd chairman franz müntefering said it was a " bitter defeat " and immediately announced that his party would propose holding a general election late this year , around 12 months ahead of the scheduled date of september 2006 . " the chancellor and i have given notice that we will seek to hold general elections in the autumn , " müntefering said .
the party would discuss the proposal on monday but the final decision would have to be made by the bundestag lower house of parliament , he added . schröder added that the " bitter defeat " for the spd " throws into question " his ruling coalition 's ability to govern .
he was therefore in favour of holding a general election " in autumn this year " , one year ahead of the scheduled date . north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany with 18 million residents , was the last remaining state governed by a coalition of social democrats and greens , the so-called red-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . the defeat is the latest in a series of poor state election results for schröder 's party .
in 1999 , it governed in 11 of germany 's 16 states but is now in charge of only five . merkel hails sensational victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker kauder , left , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and chairwoman angela merkel , right , cheer in the party 's headquarters in berlin after a press conference following the announcement of exit polls of the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , sunday , may 22 , 2005 .
first exit polls predict a victory of the cdu .
the result is widely viewed as a strong indicator for next year 's national vote .
christian democrat leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schroeder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , hailed the outcome as " sensational " . " the voters have given the christian democratic union a sensational result , they have showed hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of early elections .
" every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " merkel said . new state premier rüttgers looks to fdp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers rüttgers , the cdu 's lead candidate in the state , had capitalized on the high unemployment rate in the heavily industrialized state where 1.1 million people are out of work , just over one fifth of the national total . a series of social security and labor market reforms introduced by schröder 's government have proved deeply unpopular with the spd 's traditional working-class voters .
that was reflected in what , if confirmed , would be its worst state election result in north rhine-westphalia for 51 years . the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , won 6.2 percent with the greens taking 6.0 percent , the exit polls showed . rüttgers said he would begin negotiations with the fdp as soon as possible with a view to forming a ruling coalition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .

however , while following his predecessor 's line so far , questions remain about his own future plans . a month into his pontificate , benedict xvi has confirmed the broad diplomatic and theological lines of his predecessor john paul ii but has left few clues as to how he intends to make his own mark as head of the roman catholic church . once-cardinal joseph ratzinger , known for his conservative stance as the vatican 's guardian of dogma , pope benedict has concentrated since his election on april 19 on reassuring and coming to grips with the church and public opinion before presenting his own vision of the future . " my real program of governance is not to do my own will , not to pursue my own ideas , but to listen , together with the whole church , to the word and the will of the lord , " the 78-year-old benedict xvi said at his inauguration mass . hints at future plans but no concrete action as yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has nonetheless given hints into which issues he plans to address : opening ties with communist china , engaging in ecumenical dialogue , pursuing improved relations with jews and dialogue with islam and other religions . many are now waiting to see whether these initial declarations of intent will turn into concrete action . contacts between the vatican and beijing have multiplied since the death of polish-born john paul ii , but they have been led by the rome-based catholic community of sant 'egidio and will eventually have to be taken over by the diplomats of the holy see .
there are no formal ties between china and the vatican city-state . regarding christian unity , the pope can also benefit from the recent rapprochement between catholic and anglican theologians on marian practices , which have divided the churches for 500 years . but the true test will be whether he is able to improve ties with russia 's orthodox church , which john paul ii was unable to achieve before his death on april 2 . reconciliation work to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emeritus chief rabbi of rome elio toaff is seen greeting pope john paul ii after a concert in the paul vi hall at the vatican , on jan .
17 , 2004 .
german-born benedict xvi has vowed to pursue the work of reconciliation with judaism launched by pope john paul , and plans a historic visit to the synagogue of cologne when he travels to the german city of the world youth days in august . in just a month in office , the pope can already count at least one success : improving his image as a stern vatican watchdog . according to a poll published in italy 's la repubblica daily tuesday , 78 percent of italians have a good opinion of the pope , although they do not expect him to carry out the changes they wish to see in the church 's positions on contraception , abortion and assisted procreation . hard line still in evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new pope has in fact reaffirmed the church 's insistence on the sacred nature of all human life from conception to natural death , calling abortion murder and indicating that the " preservation of life " would be a central theme of his pontificate . he has also underlined the catholic church 's universal vocation to break through the barriers of racism and class divisions and cross the borders between peoples - key themes of the church 's progressive wing . in addressing all these issues , the pope has repeatedly evoked his human fragility as " simple and humble laborer in the vineyard of the lord . " benedict coming to terms with public persona coming after the 26-year rule of charismatic and media-savvy john paul ii , benedict xvi appears to be a reserved man .
although he seems to be relaxing as the weeks go by in his contact with the faithful , vatican observers consider him more of an intellectual pope than outgoing political figure . the pope has distanced himself from more popular forms of piety encouraged by john paul ii , although he seemingly gave in to popular pressure to skip a five-year wait before launching the beatification procedure for pope john paul . contrary to his predecessor , for example , benedict xvi has chosen not to preside over all beatification ceremonies . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de john paul ii on fast track to sainthood pope benedict xvi announced on friday that he had started the process to beatify his predecessor john paul ii , dispensing with rules that require a five-year waiting period before the sainthood procedure can start .

television polls showed the extent of the defeat , showing the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in front with 45.0 percent , ahead of the spd 's 37.5 percent , and enough to win control of a region schröder 's party has ruled since 1966 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück the sdp 's peer steinbrück will make way as state premier for the conservative candidate jürgen rüttgers once the result has been confirmed . the shockwaves will be felt from the western state all the way to the capital and will surely reverberate through the coming 12 months , shaking schröder 's already faltering leadership ahead of the general election .
the loss of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is an indication that schröder 's hoped for a third term is looking increasingly less likely . in contrast , the result is likely to boost the chances that cdu leader angela merkel will run against schröder in 2006 , raising the prospect of germany 's first woman chancellor . a desperate shift to the left on the cards ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the likely policy change as a result of the defeat could see the sdp move further over to the left in a bid to win back traditional voters that abandoned them in nrw .
the left-wing of the party , which opposed the chancellor 's welfare reforms , has been clamoring for a return to more traditional worker-friendly policies and may get that swing on the back of the result on sunday . but the defeat may have more far-reaching consequences .

television polls showed the extent of the defeat , showing the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in front with 45.0 percent , ahead of the spd 's 37.5 percent , and enough to win control of a region schröder 's party has ruled since 1966 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück the sdp 's peer steinbrück will make way as state premier for the conservative candidate jürgen rüttgers once the result has been confirmed . the shockwaves will be felt from the western state all the way to the capital and will surely reverberate through the coming 12 months , shaking schröder 's already faltering leadership ahead of the general election .
the loss of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is an indication that schröder 's hoped for a third term is looking increasingly less likely . in contrast , the result is likely to boost the chances that cdu leader angela merkel will run against schröder in 2006 , raising the prospect of germany 's first woman chancellor . a desperate shift to the left on the cards ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the likely policy change as a result of the defeat could see the sdp move further over to the left in a bid to win back traditional voters that abandoned them in nrw .
the left-wing of the party , which opposed the chancellor 's welfare reforms , has been clamoring for a return to more traditional worker-friendly policies and may get that swing on the back of the result on sunday . but the defeat may have more far-reaching consequences .

traveling around the globe for a year and visiting 60 countries along the way might be a dream for many .
but the " hotels " jan de cock stayed at during his trip would surely deter most people : prisons . spending time in an overcrowded african prison is not something to aspire to .
but for de cock , it was an experience he had dreamt about for a long time . for the past 20 years , the belgian has been interested in the fate of prisoners , who are often forgotten by the rest of society . " let me make clear that i 'm for justice and for punishing criminals , " he said .
" but it 's not my right to condemn these men and women , these teenagers and children a second or third time .
i want to show these people in a different light .
they 're people just like us . " it was n't easy for de cock to convince officials to let him stay in a prison for a few days and nights just like regular inmates .
it took him three years and hundreds of letters to embassies , ministries and prison directors to prepare for the journey . sleeping with rats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners inside a prison in cotnonou , benin in the end , he received permission to stay at 66 prisons around the globe - some in democratic countries , others run by dictatorial regimes . " the first prison i slept at was in kigali in ruwanda , " he said , adding that the prison , which was built for 2,000 inmates , housed 7,000 people . " i was wedged between fellow inmates , " he said .
" below the beds , where i keep my slippers at home , lay three or four more prisoners .
i remember that i woke up in the middle of the night because something was crawling through my hair .
it was my first encounter with a giant rat . " choosing benin over us de cock said he does believe that prisons reflect a country 's political system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates in a privately-run prison in nevada " you can tell the level of democracy that exists in a country by the way prisoners are dealt with , " he said , adding that democracies do n't always treat their prisoners more humanely . " if you 'd present me with a choice to stay in a clean prison in the us or under miserable conditions as is the case in -lrb- benin 's -rrb- coutonou prison , where 250 people share a room built for 50 , i think i 'd choose the latter , " he said .
" people keep each other alive if they can be together , even if the situation is horrible . " similarities despite regional differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isolation is the worst kind of punishment , de cock said , adding that japan is especially harsh with prisoners .
there , inmates are told in which position they have to sleep .
they are not allowed to talk .
they must n't look guards in the eye . scandinavian prisons on the other hand try to prepare prisoners for their re-entry into society .
in latin america , de cock was surprised by the extreme corruption that exists in prisons there . but despite regional differences , prisoners resemble each other in many ways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners in a cell at moscow 's 18th-century butyrka prison " the thing that hit me most was the extreme sense of abandonment felt by these people , " he said .
" i remember the case of a women in a prison in peru , lima .
when she was released after 27 years behind bars , she came back three days later and begged to be readmitted .
she did n't know anyone on the outside any more . " learning from inmates de cock heard many similar stories during his visits .
in many cases , he was the first person to show any interest in inmates for years , he said . " the more you enter this world , the more you realize that nice things happen there as well , " he said .
" you realize that these people that have been condemned by society can teach us something as well - about trust , about patience and solidarity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates at guantanamo bay prison trying to share his experiences with others , de cock has written a book , " hotel prison , " about his book .
he 's also planning to continue his journey , he said .
" i 'd like to take a look at guantanamo bay , " he said , adding that iraq 's abu ghraib prison is also on his list . christiane wolters -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's graying gangsters criminality among german senior citizens is on the rise .

traveling around the globe for a year and visiting 60 countries along the way might be a dream for many .
but the " hotels " jan de cock stayed at during his trip would surely deter most people : prisons . spending time in an overcrowded african prison is not something to aspire to .
but for de cock , it was an experience he had dreamt about for a long time . for the past 20 years , the belgian has been interested in the fate of prisoners , who are often forgotten by the rest of society . " let me make clear that i 'm for justice and for punishing criminals , " he said .
" but it 's not my right to condemn these men and women , these teenagers and children a second or third time .
i want to show these people in a different light .
they 're people just like us . " it was n't easy for de cock to convince officials to let him stay in a prison for a few days and nights just like regular inmates .
it took him three years and hundreds of letters to embassies , ministries and prison directors to prepare for the journey . sleeping with rats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners inside a prison in cotnonou , benin in the end , he received permission to stay at 66 prisons around the globe - some in democratic countries , others run by dictatorial regimes . " the first prison i slept at was in kigali in ruwanda , " he said , adding that the prison , which was built for 2,000 inmates , housed 7,000 people . " i was wedged between fellow inmates , " he said .
" below the beds , where i keep my slippers at home , lay three or four more prisoners .
i remember that i woke up in the middle of the night because something was crawling through my hair .
it was my first encounter with a giant rat . " choosing benin over us de cock said he does believe that prisons reflect a country 's political system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates in a privately-run prison in nevada " you can tell the level of democracy that exists in a country by the way prisoners are dealt with , " he said , adding that democracies do n't always treat their prisoners more humanely . " if you 'd present me with a choice to stay in a clean prison in the us or under miserable conditions as is the case in -lrb- benin 's -rrb- coutonou prison , where 250 people share a room built for 50 , i think i 'd choose the latter , " he said .
" people keep each other alive if they can be together , even if the situation is horrible . " similarities despite regional differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isolation is the worst kind of punishment , de cock said , adding that japan is especially harsh with prisoners .
there , inmates are told in which position they have to sleep .
they are not allowed to talk .
they must n't look guards in the eye . scandinavian prisons on the other hand try to prepare prisoners for their re-entry into society .
in latin america , de cock was surprised by the extreme corruption that exists in prisons there . but despite regional differences , prisoners resemble each other in many ways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners in a cell at moscow 's 18th-century butyrka prison " the thing that hit me most was the extreme sense of abandonment felt by these people , " he said .
" i remember the case of a women in a prison in peru , lima .
when she was released after 27 years behind bars , she came back three days later and begged to be readmitted .
she did n't know anyone on the outside any more . " learning from inmates de cock heard many similar stories during his visits .
in many cases , he was the first person to show any interest in inmates for years , he said . " the more you enter this world , the more you realize that nice things happen there as well , " he said .
" you realize that these people that have been condemned by society can teach us something as well - about trust , about patience and solidarity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates at guantanamo bay prison trying to share his experiences with others , de cock has written a book , " hotel prison , " about his book .

" it 's wholly justified .
if we did not get the result we wanted we would not hesitate to use our veto , " the finance minister told bbc television . the british government rejects the eu proposals to freeze the annual budget rebate in 2007 and ultimately reduce it , arguing that it receives far less agricultural and regional development funding than its european counterparts . " it is the right thing to do because we get so little of the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- receipts , we get so little of the structural and cohesion funds receipts , that our rebate is wholly justified , " brown said . " i was at a meeting last saturday and made it absolutely clear that our rebate was wholly justified , " brown added , referring to the eu talks in luxembourg .
" jack straw is going -lrb- to the meeting in brussels -rrb- and he will make that absolutely clear as well . " straw to fight " unfairly high " demands straw said previously in march that his government was ready to use its veto to retain the long-cherished rebate - worth some three billion pounds -lrb- $ 5.5 billion , 4.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . the eu subsidies system has been modernized hugely since the rebate was first granted in 1984 - but london insists britain 's contribution to brussels would still be unfairly high without it . " the reason is because france , for example , is getting high amounts of agricultural subsidies receipts .
we do n't , " brown added .
" which means that without the rebate , there would be a gap which would mean that we would be paying far more than france , far more than italy , far more than other countries . " rebate preventing breakthrough on eu budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu finance ministers have been wrangling over the budget for months other brussels diplomats said that if it were not for the issue of britain 's rebate , the proposals by the luxembourg presidency could probably break a deadlock over the overall eu budget . " the presidency has done its work so well that technically it would not be very difficult to reach an agreement , " a french diplomat said .
" the real problem is the british rebate , " he added .
the french diplomat said that the problem was that successive british governments had lived on the rebate for 20 years and that the british were unlikely to budge .
for the british , " there is the crown and the check " he said . eu wants budget sorted before britain 's presidency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg , a veteran broker in eu affairs , wants an agreement to be struck at a summit in brussles of eu leaders on june 16 and 17 because otherwise the budget likely will languish once britain takes over the eu 's rotating presidency for six months in july . " if we want to get a political agreement , everybody around the table has to make sacrifices , but sacrifices that they can justify , " a luxembourg source said . the battle lines over the overall eu 's budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 are roughly drawn between the european commission which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . commission pushing for increased contributions luxembourg has proposed an overall budget for the eu in a range from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.085 trillion - $ 1.129 trillion -rrb- , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gross national income . the commission is angling for an eu budget of one trillion euros while the six main contributors have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gni . while putting the british rebate into question , the luxembourg proposals suggest that germany , the netherlands and sweden - the biggest contributors to the eu 's budget - should benefit from " specific measures " . taking a leaf out of margaret thatcher 's book , luxembourg proposals said such measures were justified because " no member state should sustain a budgetary burden which is excessive in relation to its relative prosperity " .
that was the same grounds thatcher originally based her argument for the rebate . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain protests eu budget plans british officials have labelled eu budget plans which would see britain 's € 4 billion rebate scrapped " unfair " after the european commission revealed the proposals for spending between 2007 and 2013 .

an spd defeat would be bad news for the government ahead of the general election in 2006 . germany 's social democrats have their backs to the wall ahead of a key weekend election in a state they have held for nearly four decades , which could spell the beginning of the end for the government of chancellor gerhard schröder . schröder made a passionate plea to voters on friday to back his social democrats and their green coalition partners in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state with 18 million people . opinion polls show the social democrats are set to lose control of the state in sunday 's vote , after 39 years in charge - as disgruntled voters alarmed over a steady loss of jobs and erosion of social benefits head in droves to the opposition . defeat could spell bad omen for 2006 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder be walking away come 2006 ?
the state which forms the industrial heartland of germany appears almost certain to elect the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , an ominous sign for schröder as a general election looms in september 2006 .
defeat in the social democrat stronghold of 13.3 million voters would complete a miserable series of state election results for the chancellor . in 1999 , the spd governed in 11 of germany 's 16 regions but if it loses on sunday it will be in charge of only five . north rhine-westphalia is the only state ruled by a social democrat-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . schröder pleads with nrw for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , schröder told party supporters in dortmund that the state must stay loyal to its traditional politics .
" social democracy is the trademark of north rhine-westphalia and it must remain that way , " the chancellor said , flanked by spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero who had come to lend his support .
the federal government " needs the support of north rhine-westphalia , " schröder said , praising the state for its " social cohesion " . concerning the social security and labor market reforms that have improved competitiveness but swelled unemployment to 1.1 million in this region of coalmines and steelworks , schröder said they were a bitter pill germany must swallow .
" we must complete the overhaul of our social state , " he said .
" if we do not solve these problems we have no chance of staying among the top nations in the world . " unemployment has soared to around five million nationally and north rhine-westphalia has been particularly hard hit where in some areas close to one-quarter of the work force is jobless .
thirty years ago , coal and steel accounted for 830,000 jobs in the state , but now the figure is just 130,000 and as a result , unemployment in the most blighted areas is twice as high as the state average of 12 percent . opposition lead looks conclusive , says poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's jürgen rüttgers and his wife angelika on the campaign trail the conservative cdu is credited with 44 percent of the vote in north rhine-westphalia , ahead of the social democrats with 25 percent , the greens with nine percent and the liberal free democrats ' seven percent , according to a poll released by zdf public television . however the current state premier , peer steinbrueck , enjoys a high approval rating - 52 percent would back him if he were standing for direct election , against 30 percent for his conservative rival jürgen rüttgers , according to a poll published by ard public television . spd pins hopes on " undecided " voters steinbrueck , who admits on his campaign poster that he " can not promise jobs " , conceded on friday that " nationally , the overall trend is strongly against the spd " , but pointed to the large number of undecided voters as proof that the race was far from over . however , even if it takes north-rhine westphalia , the cdu will still lack the two-thirds majority in the federal upper chamber , or bundesrat , that would enable it to block the government 's decisions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear and confusion on the campaign trail the north rhine-westphalia state election has been the center of attention for weeks .

" the chancellor and i have given notice that we will seek to hold general elections in the autumn , " müntefering said .
the party would discuss the proposal on monday but the final decision would have to be made by the bundestag lower house of parliament , he added . schröder added that the " bitter defeat " for the spd " throws into question " his ruling coalition 's ability to govern .
he was therefore in favour of holding a general election " in autumn this year " , one year ahead of the scheduled date . north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany with 18 million residents , was the last remaining state governed by a coalition of social democrats and greens , the so-called red-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . the defeat is the latest in a series of poor state election results for schröder 's party .
in 1999 , it governed in 11 of germany 's 16 states but is now in charge of only five . merkel hails sensational victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker kauder , left , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and chairwoman angela merkel , right , cheer in the party 's headquarters in berlin after a press conference following the announcement of exit polls of the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , sunday , may 22 , 2005 .
first exit polls predict a victory of the cdu .
the result is widely viewed as a strong indicator for next year 's national vote .
christian democrat leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schroeder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , hailed the outcome as " sensational " . " the voters have given the christian democratic union a sensational result , they have showed hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of early elections .
" every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " merkel said . new state premier rüttgers looks to fdp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers rüttgers , the cdu 's lead candidate in the state , had capitalized on the high unemployment rate in the heavily industrialized state where 1.1 million people are out of work , just over one fifth of the national total . a series of social security and labor market reforms introduced by schröder 's government have proved deeply unpopular with the spd 's traditional working-class voters .
that was reflected in what , if confirmed , would be its worst state election result in north rhine-westphalia for 51 years . the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , won 6.2 percent with the greens taking 6.0 percent , the exit polls showed . rüttgers said he would begin negotiations with the fdp as soon as possible with a view to forming a ruling coalition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .

" it 's wholly justified .
if we did not get the result we wanted we would not hesitate to use our veto , " the finance minister told bbc television . the british government rejects the eu proposals to freeze the annual budget rebate in 2007 and ultimately reduce it , arguing that it receives far less agricultural and regional development funding than its european counterparts . " it is the right thing to do because we get so little of the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- receipts , we get so little of the structural and cohesion funds receipts , that our rebate is wholly justified , " brown said . " i was at a meeting last saturday and made it absolutely clear that our rebate was wholly justified , " brown added , referring to the eu talks in luxembourg .
" jack straw is going -lrb- to the meeting in brussels -rrb- and he will make that absolutely clear as well . " straw to fight " unfairly high " demands straw said previously in march that his government was ready to use its veto to retain the long-cherished rebate - worth some three billion pounds -lrb- $ 5.5 billion , 4.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . the eu subsidies system has been modernized hugely since the rebate was first granted in 1984 - but london insists britain 's contribution to brussels would still be unfairly high without it . " the reason is because france , for example , is getting high amounts of agricultural subsidies receipts .
we do n't , " brown added .
" which means that without the rebate , there would be a gap which would mean that we would be paying far more than france , far more than italy , far more than other countries . " rebate preventing breakthrough on eu budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu finance ministers have been wrangling over the budget for months other brussels diplomats said that if it were not for the issue of britain 's rebate , the proposals by the luxembourg presidency could probably break a deadlock over the overall eu budget . " the presidency has done its work so well that technically it would not be very difficult to reach an agreement , " a french diplomat said .
" the real problem is the british rebate , " he added .
the french diplomat said that the problem was that successive british governments had lived on the rebate for 20 years and that the british were unlikely to budge .
for the british , " there is the crown and the check " he said . eu wants budget sorted before britain 's presidency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg , a veteran broker in eu affairs , wants an agreement to be struck at a summit in brussles of eu leaders on june 16 and 17 because otherwise the budget likely will languish once britain takes over the eu 's rotating presidency for six months in july . " if we want to get a political agreement , everybody around the table has to make sacrifices , but sacrifices that they can justify , " a luxembourg source said . the battle lines over the overall eu 's budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 are roughly drawn between the european commission which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . commission pushing for increased contributions luxembourg has proposed an overall budget for the eu in a range from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.085 trillion - $ 1.129 trillion -rrb- , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gross national income . the commission is angling for an eu budget of one trillion euros while the six main contributors have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gni . while putting the british rebate into question , the luxembourg proposals suggest that germany , the netherlands and sweden - the biggest contributors to the eu 's budget - should benefit from " specific measures " . taking a leaf out of margaret thatcher 's book , luxembourg proposals said such measures were justified because " no member state should sustain a budgetary burden which is excessive in relation to its relative prosperity " .
that was the same grounds thatcher originally based her argument for the rebate . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain protests eu budget plans british officials have labelled eu budget plans which would see britain 's € 4 billion rebate scrapped " unfair " after the european commission revealed the proposals for spending between 2007 and 2013 .
-lrb- july 17 , 2004 -rrb- britain in row with eu over budget rebate britain 's eu budget rebate could be cut after the european commission admitted it would debate plans to that effect in the coming weeks .
if approved , the u.k. would become the biggest net contributor of eu funds .

for the british , " there is the crown and the check " he said . eu wants budget sorted before britain 's presidency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg , a veteran broker in eu affairs , wants an agreement to be struck at a summit in brussles of eu leaders on june 16 and 17 because otherwise the budget likely will languish once britain takes over the eu 's rotating presidency for six months in july . " if we want to get a political agreement , everybody around the table has to make sacrifices , but sacrifices that they can justify , " a luxembourg source said . the battle lines over the overall eu 's budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 are roughly drawn between the european commission which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . commission pushing for increased contributions luxembourg has proposed an overall budget for the eu in a range from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.085 trillion - $ 1.129 trillion -rrb- , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gross national income . the commission is angling for an eu budget of one trillion euros while the six main contributors have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gni . while putting the british rebate into question , the luxembourg proposals suggest that germany , the netherlands and sweden - the biggest contributors to the eu 's budget - should benefit from " specific measures " . taking a leaf out of margaret thatcher 's book , luxembourg proposals said such measures were justified because " no member state should sustain a budgetary burden which is excessive in relation to its relative prosperity " .
that was the same grounds thatcher originally based her argument for the rebate . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain protests eu budget plans british officials have labelled eu budget plans which would see britain 's € 4 billion rebate scrapped " unfair " after the european commission revealed the proposals for spending between 2007 and 2013 .

traveling around the globe for a year and visiting 60 countries along the way might be a dream for many .
but the " hotels " jan de cock stayed at during his trip would surely deter most people : prisons . spending time in an overcrowded african prison is not something to aspire to .
but for de cock , it was an experience he had dreamt about for a long time . for the past 20 years , the belgian has been interested in the fate of prisoners , who are often forgotten by the rest of society . " let me make clear that i 'm for justice and for punishing criminals , " he said .
" but it 's not my right to condemn these men and women , these teenagers and children a second or third time .
i want to show these people in a different light .
they 're people just like us . " it was n't easy for de cock to convince officials to let him stay in a prison for a few days and nights just like regular inmates .
it took him three years and hundreds of letters to embassies , ministries and prison directors to prepare for the journey . sleeping with rats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners inside a prison in cotnonou , benin in the end , he received permission to stay at 66 prisons around the globe - some in democratic countries , others run by dictatorial regimes . " the first prison i slept at was in kigali in ruwanda , " he said , adding that the prison , which was built for 2,000 inmates , housed 7,000 people . " i was wedged between fellow inmates , " he said .
" below the beds , where i keep my slippers at home , lay three or four more prisoners .
i remember that i woke up in the middle of the night because something was crawling through my hair .
it was my first encounter with a giant rat . " choosing benin over us de cock said he does believe that prisons reflect a country 's political system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inmates in a privately-run prison in nevada " you can tell the level of democracy that exists in a country by the way prisoners are dealt with , " he said , adding that democracies do n't always treat their prisoners more humanely . " if you 'd present me with a choice to stay in a clean prison in the us or under miserable conditions as is the case in -lrb- benin 's -rrb- coutonou prison , where 250 people share a room built for 50 , i think i 'd choose the latter , " he said .
" people keep each other alive if they can be together , even if the situation is horrible . " similarities despite regional differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isolation is the worst kind of punishment , de cock said , adding that japan is especially harsh with prisoners .
there , inmates are told in which position they have to sleep .
they are not allowed to talk .
they must n't look guards in the eye . scandinavian prisons on the other hand try to prepare prisoners for their re-entry into society .
in latin america , de cock was surprised by the extreme corruption that exists in prisons there . but despite regional differences , prisoners resemble each other in many ways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners in a cell at moscow 's 18th-century butyrka prison " the thing that hit me most was the extreme sense of abandonment felt by these people , " he said .
" i remember the case of a women in a prison in peru , lima .
when she was released after 27 years behind bars , she came back three days later and begged to be readmitted .
she did n't know anyone on the outside any more . " learning from inmates de cock heard many similar stories during his visits .
in many cases , he was the first person to show any interest in inmates for years , he said . " the more you enter this world , the more you realize that nice things happen there as well , " he said .

" the chancellor and i have given notice that we will seek to hold general elections in the autumn , " müntefering said .
the party would discuss the proposal on monday but the final decision would have to be made by the bundestag lower house of parliament , he added . schröder added that the " bitter defeat " for the spd " throws into question " his ruling coalition 's ability to govern .

that was reflected in what , if confirmed , would be its worst state election result in north rhine-westphalia for 51 years . the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , won 6.2 percent with the greens taking 6.0 percent , the exit polls showed . rüttgers said he would begin negotiations with the fdp as soon as possible with a view to forming a ruling coalition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .

"
gracia tries to identify charitable persons unknown germany 's entry in the 50th eurovision song contest finished last with four votes as greece took the crown at the celebration of kitsch in kiev on saturday .
gracia 's song " run and hide " had voters turning off . germany 's eurovision song contest hopes were more than dashed on saturday night ; they were thrown to the floor and stamped on by every stiletto and cuban heel on show at the 50th gala of kitsch in kiev . gracia bauer , a former talent show also-ran who had courted controversy over her involvement in a chart-rigging scandal just weeks before the competition , garnered a woeful four points with her song " run and hide " .
it seemed like the voters took her words as sound advice as germany scored one of its lowest totals in the history of the competition . the dubious accolade of eurovision winner went to greece as singer helena paparizou thrashed the competition , triumphing over contestants from 23 other countries with her song " my number one . "
the news was greeted with scenes of joys in athens , where hundreds of people celebrated on the streets of the greek capital . greece celebrates eurovision victory in athens , paparizou fans , who had watched the contest on a giant screen late saturday in front of the zappeion palace , went wild when the greek victory was announced .
brandishing greek flags , they danced and embraced to the beat of " my number one , " written by christos dantis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " many congratulations to helena , " said athens mayor dora bakoyannis , who was on the scene .
" it 's a unique moment that we deserve ...
athens is ready to welcome eurovision in 2006 . " ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , who attended the songfest with his family , handed paparizou the eurovision award .
yushchenko handed paparizou a golden trophy inspired by jewels crafted by the scythians , an ancient people that once inhabited the territory of present-day ukraine . " this is a ukrainian prize for best european song , for europe 's best singer -lrb- handed -rrb- in the name of a united europe , " yushchenko said after giving paparizou a peck on the cheek . clad in a short golden dress , paparizou , who was born and raised in sweden , gave an energetic performance which included elements of a traditional greek national dance . paparizou , who was elected by television viewers from 39 countries , won with 230 points , 38 points ahead of malta 's chiara , who placed second with the song " angel . "
romania 's luminita anghel and sistem placed third with " let me try . " controversy surrounds ukrainian song bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winner of eurovision 2004 ruslana lyzhychko with viktor yushchenko .

"
gracia tries to identify charitable persons unknown germany 's entry in the 50th eurovision song contest finished last with four votes as greece took the crown at the celebration of kitsch in kiev on saturday .
gracia 's song " run and hide " had voters turning off . germany 's eurovision song contest hopes were more than dashed on saturday night ; they were thrown to the floor and stamped on by every stiletto and cuban heel on show at the 50th gala of kitsch in kiev . gracia bauer , a former talent show also-ran who had courted controversy over her involvement in a chart-rigging scandal just weeks before the competition , garnered a woeful four points with her song " run and hide " .
it seemed like the voters took her words as sound advice as germany scored one of its lowest totals in the history of the competition . the dubious accolade of eurovision winner went to greece as singer helena paparizou thrashed the competition , triumphing over contestants from 23 other countries with her song " my number one . "
the news was greeted with scenes of joys in athens , where hundreds of people celebrated on the streets of the greek capital . greece celebrates eurovision victory in athens , paparizou fans , who had watched the contest on a giant screen late saturday in front of the zappeion palace , went wild when the greek victory was announced .
brandishing greek flags , they danced and embraced to the beat of " my number one , " written by christos dantis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " many congratulations to helena , " said athens mayor dora bakoyannis , who was on the scene .
" it 's a unique moment that we deserve ...
athens is ready to welcome eurovision in 2006 . " ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , who attended the songfest with his family , handed paparizou the eurovision award .
yushchenko handed paparizou a golden trophy inspired by jewels crafted by the scythians , an ancient people that once inhabited the territory of present-day ukraine . " this is a ukrainian prize for best european song , for europe 's best singer -lrb- handed -rrb- in the name of a united europe , " yushchenko said after giving paparizou a peck on the cheek . clad in a short golden dress , paparizou , who was born and raised in sweden , gave an energetic performance which included elements of a traditional greek national dance . paparizou , who was elected by television viewers from 39 countries , won with 230 points , 38 points ahead of malta 's chiara , who placed second with the song " angel . "
romania 's luminita anghel and sistem placed third with " let me try . " controversy surrounds ukrainian song bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winner of eurovision 2004 ruslana lyzhychko with viktor yushchenko .
last year 's winner , ukraine 's ruslana , opened the competition with a performance of one of her songs , " fire " . this year 's ukrainian candidate , the greenjolly group , placed only 20th .
its selection to represent the former soviet republic had sparked controversy , as had its choice of song , " razom nas bahato " -lrb- together we are many -rrb- , the hymn sung by demonstrators against former president leonid kuchma 's regime in kiev 's independence square during last year 's " orange revolution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.05.2005 european union targets britain 's rebate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister blair and chancellor brown face eu pressure britain faces some of the fiercest pressure in more than 20 years over its annual rebate from the european budget when eu ministers meet on sunday to battle over how much they pay into and get out of the collective pot . the ministers are meeting in brussles over dinner on sunday to voice their positions on the european union 's long-term budget before getting down to the hard bargaining at an official gathering on monday . but many of the big eu countries have already made their positions known , making statements in recent weeks to the effect that they want britain 's coveted annual rebate reconsidered . the leaders of france , germany and poland stepped up the pressure on britain with a joint call on thursday for the rebate to be reconsidered and changed . on top of that , the eu 's current luxembourg presidency proposed that the rebate be frozen and progressively reduced , seriously calling it into question for the first time since britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher secured it in 1984 . a british diplomat here said that the proposal was " utterly unacceptable " , insisting that " the british rebate , as far as we are concerned , is fully justifiable " . gordon brown threatens veto to secure rebate meanwhile , the chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown said sunday that britain would not hesitate to use its veto to hold on to its two-decade-old rebate .
" it 's wholly justified .
if we did not get the result we wanted we would not hesitate to use our veto , " the finance minister told bbc television . the british government rejects the eu proposals to freeze the annual budget rebate in 2007 and ultimately reduce it , arguing that it receives far less agricultural and regional development funding than its european counterparts . " it is the right thing to do because we get so little of the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- receipts , we get so little of the structural and cohesion funds receipts , that our rebate is wholly justified , " brown said . " i was at a meeting last saturday and made it absolutely clear that our rebate was wholly justified , " brown added , referring to the eu talks in luxembourg .
" jack straw is going -lrb- to the meeting in brussels -rrb- and he will make that absolutely clear as well . " straw to fight " unfairly high " demands straw said previously in march that his government was ready to use its veto to retain the long-cherished rebate - worth some three billion pounds -lrb- $ 5.5 billion , 4.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . the eu subsidies system has been modernized hugely since the rebate was first granted in 1984 - but london insists britain 's contribution to brussels would still be unfairly high without it . " the reason is because france , for example , is getting high amounts of agricultural subsidies receipts .
we do n't , " brown added .
" which means that without the rebate , there would be a gap which would mean that we would be paying far more than france , far more than italy , far more than other countries . " rebate preventing breakthrough on eu budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu finance ministers have been wrangling over the budget for months other brussels diplomats said that if it were not for the issue of britain 's rebate , the proposals by the luxembourg presidency could probably break a deadlock over the overall eu budget . " the presidency has done its work so well that technically it would not be very difficult to reach an agreement , " a french diplomat said .
" the real problem is the british rebate , " he added .
the french diplomat said that the problem was that successive british governments had lived on the rebate for 20 years and that the british were unlikely to budge .
for the british , " there is the crown and the check " he said . eu wants budget sorted before britain 's presidency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg , a veteran broker in eu affairs , wants an agreement to be struck at a summit in brussles of eu leaders on june 16 and 17 because otherwise the budget likely will languish once britain takes over the eu 's rotating presidency for six months in july . " if we want to get a political agreement , everybody around the table has to make sacrifices , but sacrifices that they can justify , " a luxembourg source said . the battle lines over the overall eu 's budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 are roughly drawn between the european commission which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . commission pushing for increased contributions luxembourg has proposed an overall budget for the eu in a range from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.085 trillion - $ 1.129 trillion -rrb- , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gross national income . the commission is angling for an eu budget of one trillion euros while the six main contributors have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gni . while putting the british rebate into question , the luxembourg proposals suggest that germany , the netherlands and sweden - the biggest contributors to the eu 's budget - should benefit from " specific measures " . taking a leaf out of margaret thatcher 's book , luxembourg proposals said such measures were justified because " no member state should sustain a budgetary burden which is excessive in relation to its relative prosperity " .
that was the same grounds thatcher originally based her argument for the rebate . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain protests eu budget plans british officials have labelled eu budget plans which would see britain 's € 4 billion rebate scrapped " unfair " after the european commission revealed the proposals for spending between 2007 and 2013 .

" it 's wholly justified .
if we did not get the result we wanted we would not hesitate to use our veto , " the finance minister told bbc television . the british government rejects the eu proposals to freeze the annual budget rebate in 2007 and ultimately reduce it , arguing that it receives far less agricultural and regional development funding than its european counterparts . " it is the right thing to do because we get so little of the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- receipts , we get so little of the structural and cohesion funds receipts , that our rebate is wholly justified , " brown said . " i was at a meeting last saturday and made it absolutely clear that our rebate was wholly justified , " brown added , referring to the eu talks in luxembourg .
" jack straw is going -lrb- to the meeting in brussels -rrb- and he will make that absolutely clear as well . " straw to fight " unfairly high " demands straw said previously in march that his government was ready to use its veto to retain the long-cherished rebate - worth some three billion pounds -lrb- $ 5.5 billion , 4.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . the eu subsidies system has been modernized hugely since the rebate was first granted in 1984 - but london insists britain 's contribution to brussels would still be unfairly high without it . " the reason is because france , for example , is getting high amounts of agricultural subsidies receipts .
we do n't , " brown added .
" which means that without the rebate , there would be a gap which would mean that we would be paying far more than france , far more than italy , far more than other countries . " rebate preventing breakthrough on eu budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu finance ministers have been wrangling over the budget for months other brussels diplomats said that if it were not for the issue of britain 's rebate , the proposals by the luxembourg presidency could probably break a deadlock over the overall eu budget . " the presidency has done its work so well that technically it would not be very difficult to reach an agreement , " a french diplomat said .
" the real problem is the british rebate , " he added .
the french diplomat said that the problem was that successive british governments had lived on the rebate for 20 years and that the british were unlikely to budge .
for the british , " there is the crown and the check " he said . eu wants budget sorted before britain 's presidency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg , a veteran broker in eu affairs , wants an agreement to be struck at a summit in brussles of eu leaders on june 16 and 17 because otherwise the budget likely will languish once britain takes over the eu 's rotating presidency for six months in july . " if we want to get a political agreement , everybody around the table has to make sacrifices , but sacrifices that they can justify , " a luxembourg source said . the battle lines over the overall eu 's budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 are roughly drawn between the european commission which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . commission pushing for increased contributions luxembourg has proposed an overall budget for the eu in a range from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.085 trillion - $ 1.129 trillion -rrb- , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gross national income . the commission is angling for an eu budget of one trillion euros while the six main contributors have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gni . while putting the british rebate into question , the luxembourg proposals suggest that germany , the netherlands and sweden - the biggest contributors to the eu 's budget - should benefit from " specific measures " . taking a leaf out of margaret thatcher 's book , luxembourg proposals said such measures were justified because " no member state should sustain a budgetary burden which is excessive in relation to its relative prosperity " .

" if we want to get a political agreement , everybody around the table has to make sacrifices , but sacrifices that they can justify , " a luxembourg source said . the battle lines over the overall eu 's budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 are roughly drawn between the european commission which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . commission pushing for increased contributions luxembourg has proposed an overall budget for the eu in a range from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.085 trillion - $ 1.129 trillion -rrb- , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gross national income . the commission is angling for an eu budget of one trillion euros while the six main contributors have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gni . while putting the british rebate into question , the luxembourg proposals suggest that germany , the netherlands and sweden - the biggest contributors to the eu 's budget - should benefit from " specific measures " . taking a leaf out of margaret thatcher 's book , luxembourg proposals said such measures were justified because " no member state should sustain a budgetary burden which is excessive in relation to its relative prosperity " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.05.2005 european union targets britain 's rebate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister blair and chancellor brown face eu pressure britain faces some of the fiercest pressure in more than 20 years over its annual rebate from the european budget when eu ministers meet on sunday to battle over how much they pay into and get out of the collective pot . the ministers are meeting in brussles over dinner on sunday to voice their positions on the european union 's long-term budget before getting down to the hard bargaining at an official gathering on monday . but many of the big eu countries have already made their positions known , making statements in recent weeks to the effect that they want britain 's coveted annual rebate reconsidered . the leaders of france , germany and poland stepped up the pressure on britain with a joint call on thursday for the rebate to be reconsidered and changed . on top of that , the eu 's current luxembourg presidency proposed that the rebate be frozen and progressively reduced , seriously calling it into question for the first time since britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher secured it in 1984 . a british diplomat here said that the proposal was " utterly unacceptable " , insisting that " the british rebate , as far as we are concerned , is fully justifiable " . gordon brown threatens veto to secure rebate meanwhile , the chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown said sunday that britain would not hesitate to use its veto to hold on to its two-decade-old rebate .
" it 's wholly justified .
if we did not get the result we wanted we would not hesitate to use our veto , " the finance minister told bbc television . the british government rejects the eu proposals to freeze the annual budget rebate in 2007 and ultimately reduce it , arguing that it receives far less agricultural and regional development funding than its european counterparts . " it is the right thing to do because we get so little of the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- receipts , we get so little of the structural and cohesion funds receipts , that our rebate is wholly justified , " brown said . " i was at a meeting last saturday and made it absolutely clear that our rebate was wholly justified , " brown added , referring to the eu talks in luxembourg .
" jack straw is going -lrb- to the meeting in brussels -rrb- and he will make that absolutely clear as well . " straw to fight " unfairly high " demands straw said previously in march that his government was ready to use its veto to retain the long-cherished rebate - worth some three billion pounds -lrb- $ 5.5 billion , 4.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . the eu subsidies system has been modernized hugely since the rebate was first granted in 1984 - but london insists britain 's contribution to brussels would still be unfairly high without it . " the reason is because france , for example , is getting high amounts of agricultural subsidies receipts .
we do n't , " brown added .
" which means that without the rebate , there would be a gap which would mean that we would be paying far more than france , far more than italy , far more than other countries . " rebate preventing breakthrough on eu budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu finance ministers have been wrangling over the budget for months other brussels diplomats said that if it were not for the issue of britain 's rebate , the proposals by the luxembourg presidency could probably break a deadlock over the overall eu budget . " the presidency has done its work so well that technically it would not be very difficult to reach an agreement , " a french diplomat said .
" the real problem is the british rebate , " he added .
the french diplomat said that the problem was that successive british governments had lived on the rebate for 20 years and that the british were unlikely to budge .

television polls showed the extent of the defeat , showing the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in front with 45.0 percent , ahead of the spd 's 37.5 percent , and enough to win control of a region schröder 's party has ruled since 1966 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück the sdp 's peer steinbrück will make way as state premier for the conservative candidate jürgen rüttgers once the result has been confirmed . the shockwaves will be felt from the western state all the way to the capital and will surely reverberate through the coming 12 months , shaking schröder 's already faltering leadership ahead of the general election .
the loss of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is an indication that schröder 's hoped for a third term is looking increasingly less likely . in contrast , the result is likely to boost the chances that cdu leader angela merkel will run against schröder in 2006 , raising the prospect of germany 's first woman chancellor . a desperate shift to the left on the cards ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the likely policy change as a result of the defeat could see the sdp move further over to the left in a bid to win back traditional voters that abandoned them in nrw .
the left-wing of the party , which opposed the chancellor 's welfare reforms , has been clamoring for a return to more traditional worker-friendly policies and may get that swing on the back of the result on sunday . but the defeat may have more far-reaching consequences .
a cabinet reshuffle is a possibility with left-wing targets economy minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel in precarious positions .
german media reports have said outgoing nrw premier peer steinbrück could replace eichel . reforms may face the axe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loss of nrw could also force schröder to abandon plans to cut the basic corporate tax rate to 19 percent from 25 percent , a move designed to boost growth but strongly opposed by the left .
an extension of the minimum wage to all sectors of the economy and tighter controls on hedge funds are other likely outcomes . spd party leader franz müntefering has been telegraphing the possible return to the left for weeks , launching a scathing attack on " pure capitalism " and likening some financial investors to " locusts " .
but the leftist rhetoric has come to late to save the state for the spd . the state had long been an spd stronghold dominated by the coal and steel industry but nrw has fallen on hard times .
unemployment in nrw , a state in which one in five germans live , surpassed the one million mark to a post-war high this year .
the cause of this , disgruntled residents say , is down to schröder 's controversial labor market reforms , which include jobless benefit cuts . red-green coalition on severely shaky ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's junior coalition party in the federal government was shown in the exit polls to have won 6.0 percent , the same amount as the cdu 's likely coalition partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
that puts the combined cdu-fdp at 51.0 percent , above the 43.5 percent of the spd and greens . the election result has ominous implications for the future of spd and greens cooperation as well as the future of the government .
nrw was the last german state ruled by the red-green coalition and the result leaves the increasingly tense federal partnership in berlin as the final alliance between the two parties . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats face tough election fight sunday 's state election in north rhine-westphalia looks increasingly to be a victory ripe for the opposition cdu 's picking .

" the chancellor and i have given notice that we will seek to hold general elections in the autumn , " müntefering said .
the party would discuss the proposal on monday but the final decision would have to be made by the bundestag lower house of parliament , he added . schröder added that the " bitter defeat " for the spd " throws into question " his ruling coalition 's ability to govern .
he was therefore in favour of holding a general election " in autumn this year " , one year ahead of the scheduled date . north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany with 18 million residents , was the last remaining state governed by a coalition of social democrats and greens , the so-called red-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . the defeat is the latest in a series of poor state election results for schröder 's party .
in 1999 , it governed in 11 of germany 's 16 states but is now in charge of only five . merkel hails sensational victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker kauder , left , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and chairwoman angela merkel , right , cheer in the party 's headquarters in berlin after a press conference following the announcement of exit polls of the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , sunday , may 22 , 2005 .
first exit polls predict a victory of the cdu .
the result is widely viewed as a strong indicator for next year 's national vote .
christian democrat leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schroeder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , hailed the outcome as " sensational " . " the voters have given the christian democratic union a sensational result , they have showed hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of early elections .
" every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " merkel said . new state premier rüttgers looks to fdp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers rüttgers , the cdu 's lead candidate in the state , had capitalized on the high unemployment rate in the heavily industrialized state where 1.1 million people are out of work , just over one fifth of the national total . a series of social security and labor market reforms introduced by schröder 's government have proved deeply unpopular with the spd 's traditional working-class voters .
that was reflected in what , if confirmed , would be its worst state election result in north rhine-westphalia for 51 years . the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , won 6.2 percent with the greens taking 6.0 percent , the exit polls showed . rüttgers said he would begin negotiations with the fdp as soon as possible with a view to forming a ruling coalition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.05.2005 european union targets britain 's rebate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister blair and chancellor brown face eu pressure britain faces some of the fiercest pressure in more than 20 years over its annual rebate from the european budget when eu ministers meet on sunday to battle over how much they pay into and get out of the collective pot . the ministers are meeting in brussles over dinner on sunday to voice their positions on the european union 's long-term budget before getting down to the hard bargaining at an official gathering on monday . but many of the big eu countries have already made their positions known , making statements in recent weeks to the effect that they want britain 's coveted annual rebate reconsidered . the leaders of france , germany and poland stepped up the pressure on britain with a joint call on thursday for the rebate to be reconsidered and changed . on top of that , the eu 's current luxembourg presidency proposed that the rebate be frozen and progressively reduced , seriously calling it into question for the first time since britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher secured it in 1984 . a british diplomat here said that the proposal was " utterly unacceptable " , insisting that " the british rebate , as far as we are concerned , is fully justifiable " . gordon brown threatens veto to secure rebate meanwhile , the chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown said sunday that britain would not hesitate to use its veto to hold on to its two-decade-old rebate .
" it 's wholly justified .
if we did not get the result we wanted we would not hesitate to use our veto , " the finance minister told bbc television . the british government rejects the eu proposals to freeze the annual budget rebate in 2007 and ultimately reduce it , arguing that it receives far less agricultural and regional development funding than its european counterparts . " it is the right thing to do because we get so little of the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- receipts , we get so little of the structural and cohesion funds receipts , that our rebate is wholly justified , " brown said . " i was at a meeting last saturday and made it absolutely clear that our rebate was wholly justified , " brown added , referring to the eu talks in luxembourg .
" jack straw is going -lrb- to the meeting in brussels -rrb- and he will make that absolutely clear as well . " straw to fight " unfairly high " demands straw said previously in march that his government was ready to use its veto to retain the long-cherished rebate - worth some three billion pounds -lrb- $ 5.5 billion , 4.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . the eu subsidies system has been modernized hugely since the rebate was first granted in 1984 - but london insists britain 's contribution to brussels would still be unfairly high without it . " the reason is because france , for example , is getting high amounts of agricultural subsidies receipts .
we do n't , " brown added .
" which means that without the rebate , there would be a gap which would mean that we would be paying far more than france , far more than italy , far more than other countries . " rebate preventing breakthrough on eu budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu finance ministers have been wrangling over the budget for months other brussels diplomats said that if it were not for the issue of britain 's rebate , the proposals by the luxembourg presidency could probably break a deadlock over the overall eu budget . " the presidency has done its work so well that technically it would not be very difficult to reach an agreement , " a french diplomat said .
" the real problem is the british rebate , " he added .
the french diplomat said that the problem was that successive british governments had lived on the rebate for 20 years and that the british were unlikely to budge .
for the british , " there is the crown and the check " he said . eu wants budget sorted before britain 's presidency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg , a veteran broker in eu affairs , wants an agreement to be struck at a summit in brussles of eu leaders on june 16 and 17 because otherwise the budget likely will languish once britain takes over the eu 's rotating presidency for six months in july . " if we want to get a political agreement , everybody around the table has to make sacrifices , but sacrifices that they can justify , " a luxembourg source said . the battle lines over the overall eu 's budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 are roughly drawn between the european commission which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . commission pushing for increased contributions luxembourg has proposed an overall budget for the eu in a range from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.085 trillion - $ 1.129 trillion -rrb- , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gross national income . the commission is angling for an eu budget of one trillion euros while the six main contributors have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gni . while putting the british rebate into question , the luxembourg proposals suggest that germany , the netherlands and sweden - the biggest contributors to the eu 's budget - should benefit from " specific measures " . taking a leaf out of margaret thatcher 's book , luxembourg proposals said such measures were justified because " no member state should sustain a budgetary burden which is excessive in relation to its relative prosperity " .
that was the same grounds thatcher originally based her argument for the rebate . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain protests eu budget plans british officials have labelled eu budget plans which would see britain 's € 4 billion rebate scrapped " unfair " after the european commission revealed the proposals for spending between 2007 and 2013 .

" it 's wholly justified .
if we did not get the result we wanted we would not hesitate to use our veto , " the finance minister told bbc television . the british government rejects the eu proposals to freeze the annual budget rebate in 2007 and ultimately reduce it , arguing that it receives far less agricultural and regional development funding than its european counterparts . " it is the right thing to do because we get so little of the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- receipts , we get so little of the structural and cohesion funds receipts , that our rebate is wholly justified , " brown said . " i was at a meeting last saturday and made it absolutely clear that our rebate was wholly justified , " brown added , referring to the eu talks in luxembourg .
" jack straw is going -lrb- to the meeting in brussels -rrb- and he will make that absolutely clear as well . " straw to fight " unfairly high " demands straw said previously in march that his government was ready to use its veto to retain the long-cherished rebate - worth some three billion pounds -lrb- $ 5.5 billion , 4.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . the eu subsidies system has been modernized hugely since the rebate was first granted in 1984 - but london insists britain 's contribution to brussels would still be unfairly high without it . " the reason is because france , for example , is getting high amounts of agricultural subsidies receipts .
we do n't , " brown added .

" the presidency has done its work so well that technically it would not be very difficult to reach an agreement , " a french diplomat said .
" the real problem is the british rebate , " he added .

" if we want to get a political agreement , everybody around the table has to make sacrifices , but sacrifices that they can justify , " a luxembourg source said . the battle lines over the overall eu 's budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 are roughly drawn between the european commission which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . commission pushing for increased contributions luxembourg has proposed an overall budget for the eu in a range from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.085 trillion - $ 1.129 trillion -rrb- , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gross national income . the commission is angling for an eu budget of one trillion euros while the six main contributors have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gni . while putting the british rebate into question , the luxembourg proposals suggest that germany , the netherlands and sweden - the biggest contributors to the eu 's budget - should benefit from " specific measures " . taking a leaf out of margaret thatcher 's book , luxembourg proposals said such measures were justified because " no member state should sustain a budgetary burden which is excessive in relation to its relative prosperity " .

television polls showed the extent of the defeat , showing the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in front with 45.0 percent , ahead of the spd 's 37.5 percent , and enough to win control of a region schröder 's party has ruled since 1966 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück the sdp 's peer steinbrück will make way as state premier for the conservative candidate jürgen rüttgers once the result has been confirmed . the shockwaves will be felt from the western state all the way to the capital and will surely reverberate through the coming 12 months , shaking schröder 's already faltering leadership ahead of the general election .
the loss of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is an indication that schröder 's hoped for a third term is looking increasingly less likely . in contrast , the result is likely to boost the chances that cdu leader angela merkel will run against schröder in 2006 , raising the prospect of germany 's first woman chancellor . a desperate shift to the left on the cards ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the likely policy change as a result of the defeat could see the sdp move further over to the left in a bid to win back traditional voters that abandoned them in nrw .
the left-wing of the party , which opposed the chancellor 's welfare reforms , has been clamoring for a return to more traditional worker-friendly policies and may get that swing on the back of the result on sunday . but the defeat may have more far-reaching consequences .
a cabinet reshuffle is a possibility with left-wing targets economy minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel in precarious positions .
german media reports have said outgoing nrw premier peer steinbrück could replace eichel . reforms may face the axe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loss of nrw could also force schröder to abandon plans to cut the basic corporate tax rate to 19 percent from 25 percent , a move designed to boost growth but strongly opposed by the left .
an extension of the minimum wage to all sectors of the economy and tighter controls on hedge funds are other likely outcomes . spd party leader franz müntefering has been telegraphing the possible return to the left for weeks , launching a scathing attack on " pure capitalism " and likening some financial investors to " locusts " .
but the leftist rhetoric has come to late to save the state for the spd . the state had long been an spd stronghold dominated by the coal and steel industry but nrw has fallen on hard times .
unemployment in nrw , a state in which one in five germans live , surpassed the one million mark to a post-war high this year .
the cause of this , disgruntled residents say , is down to schröder 's controversial labor market reforms , which include jobless benefit cuts . red-green coalition on severely shaky ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's junior coalition party in the federal government was shown in the exit polls to have won 6.0 percent , the same amount as the cdu 's likely coalition partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
that puts the combined cdu-fdp at 51.0 percent , above the 43.5 percent of the spd and greens . the election result has ominous implications for the future of spd and greens cooperation as well as the future of the government .
nrw was the last german state ruled by the red-green coalition and the result leaves the increasingly tense federal partnership in berlin as the final alliance between the two parties . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats face tough election fight sunday 's state election in north rhine-westphalia looks increasingly to be a victory ripe for the opposition cdu 's picking .

television polls showed the extent of the defeat , showing the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in front with 45.0 percent , ahead of the spd 's 37.5 percent , and enough to win control of a region schröder 's party has ruled since 1966 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück the sdp 's peer steinbrück will make way as state premier for the conservative candidate jürgen rüttgers once the result has been confirmed . the shockwaves will be felt from the western state all the way to the capital and will surely reverberate through the coming 12 months , shaking schröder 's already faltering leadership ahead of the general election .
the loss of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- is an indication that schröder 's hoped for a third term is looking increasingly less likely . in contrast , the result is likely to boost the chances that cdu leader angela merkel will run against schröder in 2006 , raising the prospect of germany 's first woman chancellor . a desperate shift to the left on the cards ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the likely policy change as a result of the defeat could see the sdp move further over to the left in a bid to win back traditional voters that abandoned them in nrw .
the left-wing of the party , which opposed the chancellor 's welfare reforms , has been clamoring for a return to more traditional worker-friendly policies and may get that swing on the back of the result on sunday . but the defeat may have more far-reaching consequences .
a cabinet reshuffle is a possibility with left-wing targets economy minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel in precarious positions .
german media reports have said outgoing nrw premier peer steinbrück could replace eichel . reforms may face the axe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the loss of nrw could also force schröder to abandon plans to cut the basic corporate tax rate to 19 percent from 25 percent , a move designed to boost growth but strongly opposed by the left .
an extension of the minimum wage to all sectors of the economy and tighter controls on hedge funds are other likely outcomes . spd party leader franz müntefering has been telegraphing the possible return to the left for weeks , launching a scathing attack on " pure capitalism " and likening some financial investors to " locusts " .
but the leftist rhetoric has come to late to save the state for the spd . the state had long been an spd stronghold dominated by the coal and steel industry but nrw has fallen on hard times .
unemployment in nrw , a state in which one in five germans live , surpassed the one million mark to a post-war high this year .
the cause of this , disgruntled residents say , is down to schröder 's controversial labor market reforms , which include jobless benefit cuts . red-green coalition on severely shaky ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's junior coalition party in the federal government was shown in the exit polls to have won 6.0 percent , the same amount as the cdu 's likely coalition partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.05.2005 european union targets britain 's rebate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister blair and chancellor brown face eu pressure britain faces some of the fiercest pressure in more than 20 years over its annual rebate from the european budget when eu ministers meet on sunday to battle over how much they pay into and get out of the collective pot . the ministers are meeting in brussles over dinner on sunday to voice their positions on the european union 's long-term budget before getting down to the hard bargaining at an official gathering on monday . but many of the big eu countries have already made their positions known , making statements in recent weeks to the effect that they want britain 's coveted annual rebate reconsidered . the leaders of france , germany and poland stepped up the pressure on britain with a joint call on thursday for the rebate to be reconsidered and changed . on top of that , the eu 's current luxembourg presidency proposed that the rebate be frozen and progressively reduced , seriously calling it into question for the first time since britain 's then-prime minister margaret thatcher secured it in 1984 . a british diplomat here said that the proposal was " utterly unacceptable " , insisting that " the british rebate , as far as we are concerned , is fully justifiable " . gordon brown threatens veto to secure rebate meanwhile , the chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown said sunday that britain would not hesitate to use its veto to hold on to its two-decade-old rebate .
" it 's wholly justified .
if we did not get the result we wanted we would not hesitate to use our veto , " the finance minister told bbc television . the british government rejects the eu proposals to freeze the annual budget rebate in 2007 and ultimately reduce it , arguing that it receives far less agricultural and regional development funding than its european counterparts . " it is the right thing to do because we get so little of the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- receipts , we get so little of the structural and cohesion funds receipts , that our rebate is wholly justified , " brown said . " i was at a meeting last saturday and made it absolutely clear that our rebate was wholly justified , " brown added , referring to the eu talks in luxembourg .
" jack straw is going -lrb- to the meeting in brussels -rrb- and he will make that absolutely clear as well . " straw to fight " unfairly high " demands straw said previously in march that his government was ready to use its veto to retain the long-cherished rebate - worth some three billion pounds -lrb- $ 5.5 billion , 4.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . the eu subsidies system has been modernized hugely since the rebate was first granted in 1984 - but london insists britain 's contribution to brussels would still be unfairly high without it . " the reason is because france , for example , is getting high amounts of agricultural subsidies receipts .
we do n't , " brown added .
" which means that without the rebate , there would be a gap which would mean that we would be paying far more than france , far more than italy , far more than other countries . " rebate preventing breakthrough on eu budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu finance ministers have been wrangling over the budget for months other brussels diplomats said that if it were not for the issue of britain 's rebate , the proposals by the luxembourg presidency could probably break a deadlock over the overall eu budget . " the presidency has done its work so well that technically it would not be very difficult to reach an agreement , " a french diplomat said .
" the real problem is the british rebate , " he added .
the french diplomat said that the problem was that successive british governments had lived on the rebate for 20 years and that the british were unlikely to budge .
for the british , " there is the crown and the check " he said . eu wants budget sorted before britain 's presidency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg , a veteran broker in eu affairs , wants an agreement to be struck at a summit in brussles of eu leaders on june 16 and 17 because otherwise the budget likely will languish once britain takes over the eu 's rotating presidency for six months in july . " if we want to get a political agreement , everybody around the table has to make sacrifices , but sacrifices that they can justify , " a luxembourg source said . the battle lines over the overall eu 's budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 are roughly drawn between the european commission which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . commission pushing for increased contributions luxembourg has proposed an overall budget for the eu in a range from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.085 trillion - $ 1.129 trillion -rrb- , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gross national income . the commission is angling for an eu budget of one trillion euros while the six main contributors have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gni . while putting the british rebate into question , the luxembourg proposals suggest that germany , the netherlands and sweden - the biggest contributors to the eu 's budget - should benefit from " specific measures " . taking a leaf out of margaret thatcher 's book , luxembourg proposals said such measures were justified because " no member state should sustain a budgetary burden which is excessive in relation to its relative prosperity " .
that was the same grounds thatcher originally based her argument for the rebate . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain protests eu budget plans british officials have labelled eu budget plans which would see britain 's € 4 billion rebate scrapped " unfair " after the european commission revealed the proposals for spending between 2007 and 2013 .

however , the islamic state is calling the summit " europe 's last chance " . the european union will try to coax iran back from the nuclear brink this week , warning tehran it could be hauled before the un security council if it carries out a threat to resume key atomic activities . the islamic state - suspected by the united states of wanting to build atomic weapons - is calling the meeting " the last chance for the europeans " to come up with something worth bargaining for . but the pressure on iran is multiplied by washington , waiting to direct its diplomatic fire straight at tehran if the eu talks fail .
" the bar for iran must be set very high because of its history of deception " in years of concealing its nuclear program , said nicholas burns , us under secretary for political affairs , last week . the talks will bring together iran 's top nuclear negotiators with the so-called eu-3 - the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , along with eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the exact timing and location of the talks is unclear , but diplomats say the most likely is a meeting of senior officials in brussels on tuesday before the full ministerial talks on wednesday in geneva . enrichment resumed after halt after suspending nuclear activities late last year , tehran recently said that it intends to resume some of the work it brought to a halt under an agreement reached with britain , france and germany last november . but tehran insists its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including enriching uranium , is aimed at generating electricity and is a right for a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . with tensions mounting , iranian negotiator hossein moussavian has raised the rhetoric to new levels .
he said last week that if the talks fail , uranium conversion work - a precursor to enrichment - being carried out at a plant near the central city of isfahan could restart before the presidential election on june 17 .
" the decision on resuming activities at isfahan is irreversible , " he said . carrot and stick approach ineffective so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dealing with iran 's clerical regime , the eu has held the carrot ; offering trade , security and technological incentives .
in the background , the united states has wielded the stick , leaving " all options on the table " although its more overt threats of the past have receded recently . in its letter on may 11 inviting iran back to the negotiating table , the eu warned the regime it could be heading into dangerous , uncharted territory .
" it would bring the negotiating process to an end .
the consequences beyond could only be negative for iran , " the letter from the eu three britain , france and germany read . europeans ponder vital next move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohsen mirdamadi , right , a reformist and who heads the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs and national security , talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , at iran 's parliament building in tehran .
despite these options , diplomats believe there is little room for maneuver .
" the europeans could try to put a bit more on the table , but they will not go back on their core demand , a halt in enrichment .
they have an agreement on this with the americans , and can not afford to go back , " said one . if iran resumes its suspended nuclear activities , the matter is likely to go first to the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog . from there , it would be sent to the un security council - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
given the need for consensus , with nations like russia and china , the council may just issue a warning . is stand-off an election tactic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a savvy pragmatist who has attempted to make contacts with the united states in the past , attends a press conference , after registering as a presidential candidate at the interior ministry in tehran , iran , wednesday , may 11 , 2005 .
iran 's presidential election will take place june 17 .
the unknown factor is how much the tensions can be put down to iranian electioneering .
amid the preparations for next month 's presidential poll , state television is running announcements selling the benefits of nuclear power to the public . according to dr ali ansari , at britain 's royal institute of international affairs , the regime has to appear tough before the poll .
" i think that nothing really substantial is going to happen until the iranian elections are over , " he said .

however , the islamic state is calling the summit " europe 's last chance " . the european union will try to coax iran back from the nuclear brink this week , warning tehran it could be hauled before the un security council if it carries out a threat to resume key atomic activities . the islamic state - suspected by the united states of wanting to build atomic weapons - is calling the meeting " the last chance for the europeans " to come up with something worth bargaining for . but the pressure on iran is multiplied by washington , waiting to direct its diplomatic fire straight at tehran if the eu talks fail .
" the bar for iran must be set very high because of its history of deception " in years of concealing its nuclear program , said nicholas burns , us under secretary for political affairs , last week . the talks will bring together iran 's top nuclear negotiators with the so-called eu-3 - the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , along with eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the exact timing and location of the talks is unclear , but diplomats say the most likely is a meeting of senior officials in brussels on tuesday before the full ministerial talks on wednesday in geneva . enrichment resumed after halt after suspending nuclear activities late last year , tehran recently said that it intends to resume some of the work it brought to a halt under an agreement reached with britain , france and germany last november . but tehran insists its bid to master the full nuclear fuel cycle , including enriching uranium , is aimed at generating electricity and is a right for a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . with tensions mounting , iranian negotiator hossein moussavian has raised the rhetoric to new levels .
he said last week that if the talks fail , uranium conversion work - a precursor to enrichment - being carried out at a plant near the central city of isfahan could restart before the presidential election on june 17 .
" the decision on resuming activities at isfahan is irreversible , " he said . carrot and stick approach ineffective so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in dealing with iran 's clerical regime , the eu has held the carrot ; offering trade , security and technological incentives .
in the background , the united states has wielded the stick , leaving " all options on the table " although its more overt threats of the past have receded recently . in its letter on may 11 inviting iran back to the negotiating table , the eu warned the regime it could be heading into dangerous , uncharted territory .
" it would bring the negotiating process to an end .
the consequences beyond could only be negative for iran , " the letter from the eu three britain , france and germany read . europeans ponder vital next move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohsen mirdamadi , right , a reformist and who heads the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs and national security , talks with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , at iran 's parliament building in tehran .
despite these options , diplomats believe there is little room for maneuver .
" the europeans could try to put a bit more on the table , but they will not go back on their core demand , a halt in enrichment .
they have an agreement on this with the americans , and can not afford to go back , " said one . if iran resumes its suspended nuclear activities , the matter is likely to go first to the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un 's vienna-based nuclear watchdog . from there , it would be sent to the un security council - although that does not automatically mean sanctions .
given the need for consensus , with nations like russia and china , the council may just issue a warning . is stand-off an election tactic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a savvy pragmatist who has attempted to make contacts with the united states in the past , attends a press conference , after registering as a presidential candidate at the interior ministry in tehran , iran , wednesday , may 11 , 2005 .
iran 's presidential election will take place june 17 .
the unknown factor is how much the tensions can be put down to iranian electioneering .
amid the preparations for next month 's presidential poll , state television is running announcements selling the benefits of nuclear power to the public . according to dr ali ansari , at britain 's royal institute of international affairs , the regime has to appear tough before the poll .
" i think that nothing really substantial is going to happen until the iranian elections are over , " he said .

an spd defeat would be bad news for the government ahead of the general election in 2006 . germany 's social democrats have their backs to the wall ahead of a key weekend election in a state they have held for nearly four decades , which could spell the beginning of the end for the government of chancellor gerhard schröder . schröder made a passionate plea to voters on friday to back his social democrats and their green coalition partners in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state with 18 million people . opinion polls show the social democrats are set to lose control of the state in sunday 's vote , after 39 years in charge - as disgruntled voters alarmed over a steady loss of jobs and erosion of social benefits head in droves to the opposition . defeat could spell bad omen for 2006 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder be walking away come 2006 ?

" the chancellor and i have given notice that we will seek to hold general elections in the autumn , " müntefering said .
the party would discuss the proposal on monday but the final decision would have to be made by the bundestag lower house of parliament , he added . schröder added that the " bitter defeat " for the spd " throws into question " his ruling coalition 's ability to govern .
he was therefore in favour of holding a general election " in autumn this year " , one year ahead of the scheduled date . north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany with 18 million residents , was the last remaining state governed by a coalition of social democrats and greens , the so-called red-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . the defeat is the latest in a series of poor state election results for schröder 's party .
in 1999 , it governed in 11 of germany 's 16 states but is now in charge of only five . merkel hails sensational victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker kauder , left , secretary general of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and chairwoman angela merkel , right , cheer in the party 's headquarters in berlin after a press conference following the announcement of exit polls of the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , sunday , may 22 , 2005 .
first exit polls predict a victory of the cdu .
the result is widely viewed as a strong indicator for next year 's national vote .
christian democrat leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schroeder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , hailed the outcome as " sensational " . " the voters have given the christian democratic union a sensational result , they have showed hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of early elections .
" every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " merkel said . new state premier rüttgers looks to fdp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen rüttgers rüttgers , the cdu 's lead candidate in the state , had capitalized on the high unemployment rate in the heavily industrialized state where 1.1 million people are out of work , just over one fifth of the national total . a series of social security and labor market reforms introduced by schröder 's government have proved deeply unpopular with the spd 's traditional working-class voters .
that was reflected in what , if confirmed , would be its worst state election result in north rhine-westphalia for 51 years . the cdu 's likely coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , won 6.2 percent with the greens taking 6.0 percent , the exit polls showed . rüttgers said he would begin negotiations with the fdp as soon as possible with a view to forming a ruling coalition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .

" it 's wholly justified .
if we did not get the result we wanted we would not hesitate to use our veto , " the finance minister told bbc television . the british government rejects the eu proposals to freeze the annual budget rebate in 2007 and ultimately reduce it , arguing that it receives far less agricultural and regional development funding than its european counterparts . " it is the right thing to do because we get so little of the cap -lrb- common agricultural policy -rrb- receipts , we get so little of the structural and cohesion funds receipts , that our rebate is wholly justified , " brown said . " i was at a meeting last saturday and made it absolutely clear that our rebate was wholly justified , " brown added , referring to the eu talks in luxembourg .
" jack straw is going -lrb- to the meeting in brussels -rrb- and he will make that absolutely clear as well . " straw to fight " unfairly high " demands straw said previously in march that his government was ready to use its veto to retain the long-cherished rebate - worth some three billion pounds -lrb- $ 5.5 billion , 4.4 billion euros -rrb- a year . the eu subsidies system has been modernized hugely since the rebate was first granted in 1984 - but london insists britain 's contribution to brussels would still be unfairly high without it . " the reason is because france , for example , is getting high amounts of agricultural subsidies receipts .
we do n't , " brown added .
" which means that without the rebate , there would be a gap which would mean that we would be paying far more than france , far more than italy , far more than other countries . " rebate preventing breakthrough on eu budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu finance ministers have been wrangling over the budget for months other brussels diplomats said that if it were not for the issue of britain 's rebate , the proposals by the luxembourg presidency could probably break a deadlock over the overall eu budget . " the presidency has done its work so well that technically it would not be very difficult to reach an agreement , " a french diplomat said .
" the real problem is the british rebate , " he added .
the french diplomat said that the problem was that successive british governments had lived on the rebate for 20 years and that the british were unlikely to budge .
for the british , " there is the crown and the check " he said . eu wants budget sorted before britain 's presidency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg , a veteran broker in eu affairs , wants an agreement to be struck at a summit in brussles of eu leaders on june 16 and 17 because otherwise the budget likely will languish once britain takes over the eu 's rotating presidency for six months in july . " if we want to get a political agreement , everybody around the table has to make sacrifices , but sacrifices that they can justify , " a luxembourg source said . the battle lines over the overall eu 's budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 are roughly drawn between the european commission which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . commission pushing for increased contributions luxembourg has proposed an overall budget for the eu in a range from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.085 trillion - $ 1.129 trillion -rrb- , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gross national income . the commission is angling for an eu budget of one trillion euros while the six main contributors have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gni . while putting the british rebate into question , the luxembourg proposals suggest that germany , the netherlands and sweden - the biggest contributors to the eu 's budget - should benefit from " specific measures " . taking a leaf out of margaret thatcher 's book , luxembourg proposals said such measures were justified because " no member state should sustain a budgetary burden which is excessive in relation to its relative prosperity " .

an spd defeat would be bad news for the government ahead of the general election in 2006 . germany 's social democrats have their backs to the wall ahead of a key weekend election in a state they have held for nearly four decades , which could spell the beginning of the end for the government of chancellor gerhard schröder . schröder made a passionate plea to voters on friday to back his social democrats and their green coalition partners in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state with 18 million people . opinion polls show the social democrats are set to lose control of the state in sunday 's vote , after 39 years in charge - as disgruntled voters alarmed over a steady loss of jobs and erosion of social benefits head in droves to the opposition . defeat could spell bad omen for 2006 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder be walking away come 2006 ?
the state which forms the industrial heartland of germany appears almost certain to elect the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , an ominous sign for schröder as a general election looms in september 2006 .
defeat in the social democrat stronghold of 13.3 million voters would complete a miserable series of state election results for the chancellor . in 1999 , the spd governed in 11 of germany 's 16 regions but if it loses on sunday it will be in charge of only five . north rhine-westphalia is the only state ruled by a social democrat-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . schröder pleads with nrw for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , schröder told party supporters in dortmund that the state must stay loyal to its traditional politics .
" social democracy is the trademark of north rhine-westphalia and it must remain that way , " the chancellor said , flanked by spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero who had come to lend his support .
the federal government " needs the support of north rhine-westphalia , " schröder said , praising the state for its " social cohesion " . concerning the social security and labor market reforms that have improved competitiveness but swelled unemployment to 1.1 million in this region of coalmines and steelworks , schröder said they were a bitter pill germany must swallow .
" we must complete the overhaul of our social state , " he said .
" if we do not solve these problems we have no chance of staying among the top nations in the world . " unemployment has soared to around five million nationally and north rhine-westphalia has been particularly hard hit where in some areas close to one-quarter of the work force is jobless .
thirty years ago , coal and steel accounted for 830,000 jobs in the state , but now the figure is just 130,000 and as a result , unemployment in the most blighted areas is twice as high as the state average of 12 percent . opposition lead looks conclusive , says poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's jürgen rüttgers and his wife angelika on the campaign trail the conservative cdu is credited with 44 percent of the vote in north rhine-westphalia , ahead of the social democrats with 25 percent , the greens with nine percent and the liberal free democrats ' seven percent , according to a poll released by zdf public television . however the current state premier , peer steinbrueck , enjoys a high approval rating - 52 percent would back him if he were standing for direct election , against 30 percent for his conservative rival jürgen rüttgers , according to a poll published by ard public television . spd pins hopes on " undecided " voters steinbrueck , who admits on his campaign poster that he " can not promise jobs " , conceded on friday that " nationally , the overall trend is strongly against the spd " , but pointed to the large number of undecided voters as proof that the race was far from over . however , even if it takes north-rhine westphalia , the cdu will still lack the two-thirds majority in the federal upper chamber , or bundesrat , that would enable it to block the government 's decisions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear and confusion on the campaign trail the north rhine-westphalia state election has been the center of attention for weeks .

an spd defeat would be bad news for the government ahead of the general election in 2006 . germany 's social democrats have their backs to the wall ahead of a key weekend election in a state they have held for nearly four decades , which could spell the beginning of the end for the government of chancellor gerhard schröder . schröder made a passionate plea to voters on friday to back his social democrats and their green coalition partners in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state with 18 million people . opinion polls show the social democrats are set to lose control of the state in sunday 's vote , after 39 years in charge - as disgruntled voters alarmed over a steady loss of jobs and erosion of social benefits head in droves to the opposition . defeat could spell bad omen for 2006 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder be walking away come 2006 ?

however , while following his predecessor 's line so far , questions remain about his own future plans . a month into his pontificate , benedict xvi has confirmed the broad diplomatic and theological lines of his predecessor john paul ii but has left few clues as to how he intends to make his own mark as head of the roman catholic church . once-cardinal joseph ratzinger , known for his conservative stance as the vatican 's guardian of dogma , pope benedict has concentrated since his election on april 19 on reassuring and coming to grips with the church and public opinion before presenting his own vision of the future . " my real program of governance is not to do my own will , not to pursue my own ideas , but to listen , together with the whole church , to the word and the will of the lord , " the 78-year-old benedict xvi said at his inauguration mass . hints at future plans but no concrete action as yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has nonetheless given hints into which issues he plans to address : opening ties with communist china , engaging in ecumenical dialogue , pursuing improved relations with jews and dialogue with islam and other religions . many are now waiting to see whether these initial declarations of intent will turn into concrete action . contacts between the vatican and beijing have multiplied since the death of polish-born john paul ii , but they have been led by the rome-based catholic community of sant 'egidio and will eventually have to be taken over by the diplomats of the holy see .

however , while following his predecessor 's line so far , questions remain about his own future plans . a month into his pontificate , benedict xvi has confirmed the broad diplomatic and theological lines of his predecessor john paul ii but has left few clues as to how he intends to make his own mark as head of the roman catholic church . once-cardinal joseph ratzinger , known for his conservative stance as the vatican 's guardian of dogma , pope benedict has concentrated since his election on april 19 on reassuring and coming to grips with the church and public opinion before presenting his own vision of the future . " my real program of governance is not to do my own will , not to pursue my own ideas , but to listen , together with the whole church , to the word and the will of the lord , " the 78-year-old benedict xvi said at his inauguration mass . hints at future plans but no concrete action as yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has nonetheless given hints into which issues he plans to address : opening ties with communist china , engaging in ecumenical dialogue , pursuing improved relations with jews and dialogue with islam and other religions . many are now waiting to see whether these initial declarations of intent will turn into concrete action . contacts between the vatican and beijing have multiplied since the death of polish-born john paul ii , but they have been led by the rome-based catholic community of sant 'egidio and will eventually have to be taken over by the diplomats of the holy see .
there are no formal ties between china and the vatican city-state . regarding christian unity , the pope can also benefit from the recent rapprochement between catholic and anglican theologians on marian practices , which have divided the churches for 500 years . but the true test will be whether he is able to improve ties with russia 's orthodox church , which john paul ii was unable to achieve before his death on april 2 . reconciliation work to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emeritus chief rabbi of rome elio toaff is seen greeting pope john paul ii after a concert in the paul vi hall at the vatican , on jan .
17 , 2004 .
german-born benedict xvi has vowed to pursue the work of reconciliation with judaism launched by pope john paul , and plans a historic visit to the synagogue of cologne when he travels to the german city of the world youth days in august . in just a month in office , the pope can already count at least one success : improving his image as a stern vatican watchdog . according to a poll published in italy 's la repubblica daily tuesday , 78 percent of italians have a good opinion of the pope , although they do not expect him to carry out the changes they wish to see in the church 's positions on contraception , abortion and assisted procreation . hard line still in evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new pope has in fact reaffirmed the church 's insistence on the sacred nature of all human life from conception to natural death , calling abortion murder and indicating that the " preservation of life " would be a central theme of his pontificate . he has also underlined the catholic church 's universal vocation to break through the barriers of racism and class divisions and cross the borders between peoples - key themes of the church 's progressive wing . in addressing all these issues , the pope has repeatedly evoked his human fragility as " simple and humble laborer in the vineyard of the lord . " benedict coming to terms with public persona coming after the 26-year rule of charismatic and media-savvy john paul ii , benedict xvi appears to be a reserved man .
although he seems to be relaxing as the weeks go by in his contact with the faithful , vatican observers consider him more of an intellectual pope than outgoing political figure . the pope has distanced himself from more popular forms of piety encouraged by john paul ii , although he seemingly gave in to popular pressure to skip a five-year wait before launching the beatification procedure for pope john paul . contrary to his predecessor , for example , benedict xvi has chosen not to preside over all beatification ceremonies . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de john paul ii on fast track to sainthood pope benedict xvi announced on friday that he had started the process to beatify his predecessor john paul ii , dispensing with rules that require a five-year waiting period before the sainthood procedure can start .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.05.2005 social democrats face tough election fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's spd has a fight on its hands sunday 's state election in north rhine-westphalia looks increasingly to be a victory ripe for the opposition cdu 's picking .
an spd defeat would be bad news for the government ahead of the general election in 2006 . germany 's social democrats have their backs to the wall ahead of a key weekend election in a state they have held for nearly four decades , which could spell the beginning of the end for the government of chancellor gerhard schröder . schröder made a passionate plea to voters on friday to back his social democrats and their green coalition partners in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state with 18 million people . opinion polls show the social democrats are set to lose control of the state in sunday 's vote , after 39 years in charge - as disgruntled voters alarmed over a steady loss of jobs and erosion of social benefits head in droves to the opposition . defeat could spell bad omen for 2006 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder be walking away come 2006 ?
the state which forms the industrial heartland of germany appears almost certain to elect the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , an ominous sign for schröder as a general election looms in september 2006 .
defeat in the social democrat stronghold of 13.3 million voters would complete a miserable series of state election results for the chancellor . in 1999 , the spd governed in 11 of germany 's 16 regions but if it loses on sunday it will be in charge of only five . north rhine-westphalia is the only state ruled by a social democrat-green coalition , mirroring the federal ruling coalition in berlin . schröder pleads with nrw for support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , schröder told party supporters in dortmund that the state must stay loyal to its traditional politics .
" social democracy is the trademark of north rhine-westphalia and it must remain that way , " the chancellor said , flanked by spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero who had come to lend his support .
the federal government " needs the support of north rhine-westphalia , " schröder said , praising the state for its " social cohesion " . concerning the social security and labor market reforms that have improved competitiveness but swelled unemployment to 1.1 million in this region of coalmines and steelworks , schröder said they were a bitter pill germany must swallow .
" we must complete the overhaul of our social state , " he said .
" if we do not solve these problems we have no chance of staying among the top nations in the world . " unemployment has soared to around five million nationally and north rhine-westphalia has been particularly hard hit where in some areas close to one-quarter of the work force is jobless .
thirty years ago , coal and steel accounted for 830,000 jobs in the state , but now the figure is just 130,000 and as a result , unemployment in the most blighted areas is twice as high as the state average of 12 percent . opposition lead looks conclusive , says poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's jürgen rüttgers and his wife angelika on the campaign trail the conservative cdu is credited with 44 percent of the vote in north rhine-westphalia , ahead of the social democrats with 25 percent , the greens with nine percent and the liberal free democrats ' seven percent , according to a poll released by zdf public television . however the current state premier , peer steinbrueck , enjoys a high approval rating - 52 percent would back him if he were standing for direct election , against 30 percent for his conservative rival jürgen rüttgers , according to a poll published by ard public television . spd pins hopes on " undecided " voters steinbrueck , who admits on his campaign poster that he " can not promise jobs " , conceded on friday that " nationally , the overall trend is strongly against the spd " , but pointed to the large number of undecided voters as proof that the race was far from over . however , even if it takes north-rhine westphalia , the cdu will still lack the two-thirds majority in the federal upper chamber , or bundesrat , that would enable it to block the government 's decisions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear and confusion on the campaign trail the north rhine-westphalia state election has been the center of attention for weeks .
but for all the surveys and polls , the direction of the vote is still a matter of contention - for politicians and voters alike .

however , while following his predecessor 's line so far , questions remain about his own future plans . a month into his pontificate , benedict xvi has confirmed the broad diplomatic and theological lines of his predecessor john paul ii but has left few clues as to how he intends to make his own mark as head of the roman catholic church . once-cardinal joseph ratzinger , known for his conservative stance as the vatican 's guardian of dogma , pope benedict has concentrated since his election on april 19 on reassuring and coming to grips with the church and public opinion before presenting his own vision of the future . " my real program of governance is not to do my own will , not to pursue my own ideas , but to listen , together with the whole church , to the word and the will of the lord , " the 78-year-old benedict xvi said at his inauguration mass . hints at future plans but no concrete action as yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has nonetheless given hints into which issues he plans to address : opening ties with communist china , engaging in ecumenical dialogue , pursuing improved relations with jews and dialogue with islam and other religions . many are now waiting to see whether these initial declarations of intent will turn into concrete action . contacts between the vatican and beijing have multiplied since the death of polish-born john paul ii , but they have been led by the rome-based catholic community of sant 'egidio and will eventually have to be taken over by the diplomats of the holy see .
there are no formal ties between china and the vatican city-state . regarding christian unity , the pope can also benefit from the recent rapprochement between catholic and anglican theologians on marian practices , which have divided the churches for 500 years . but the true test will be whether he is able to improve ties with russia 's orthodox church , which john paul ii was unable to achieve before his death on april 2 . reconciliation work to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emeritus chief rabbi of rome elio toaff is seen greeting pope john paul ii after a concert in the paul vi hall at the vatican , on jan .
17 , 2004 .
german-born benedict xvi has vowed to pursue the work of reconciliation with judaism launched by pope john paul , and plans a historic visit to the synagogue of cologne when he travels to the german city of the world youth days in august . in just a month in office , the pope can already count at least one success : improving his image as a stern vatican watchdog . according to a poll published in italy 's la repubblica daily tuesday , 78 percent of italians have a good opinion of the pope , although they do not expect him to carry out the changes they wish to see in the church 's positions on contraception , abortion and assisted procreation . hard line still in evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new pope has in fact reaffirmed the church 's insistence on the sacred nature of all human life from conception to natural death , calling abortion murder and indicating that the " preservation of life " would be a central theme of his pontificate . he has also underlined the catholic church 's universal vocation to break through the barriers of racism and class divisions and cross the borders between peoples - key themes of the church 's progressive wing . in addressing all these issues , the pope has repeatedly evoked his human fragility as " simple and humble laborer in the vineyard of the lord . " benedict coming to terms with public persona coming after the 26-year rule of charismatic and media-savvy john paul ii , benedict xvi appears to be a reserved man .
although he seems to be relaxing as the weeks go by in his contact with the faithful , vatican observers consider him more of an intellectual pope than outgoing political figure . the pope has distanced himself from more popular forms of piety encouraged by john paul ii , although he seemingly gave in to popular pressure to skip a five-year wait before launching the beatification procedure for pope john paul . contrary to his predecessor , for example , benedict xvi has chosen not to preside over all beatification ceremonies . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de john paul ii on fast track to sainthood pope benedict xvi announced on friday that he had started the process to beatify his predecessor john paul ii , dispensing with rules that require a five-year waiting period before the sainthood procedure can start .

marconi spokesman stephen hobson said the firm did not expect the meeting to have any affect on the redundancies .
the financial times said the dti will call on marconi to keep research and development operations in the uk .
marconi recently lost a key bt contract and there are concerns it will move units abroad if it loses more business .
the planned redundancies are a direct result of marconi not winning part of bt 's new £ 10bn uk network contract .
the blow was especially hard as marconi gets about 25 % of its work in the uk from bt and it has been fighting to turn itself around after almost collapsing in 2000 .
round table mike parton , marconi 's chief executive , and alan johnson , the secretary for trade and industry , are expected to attend the monday meeting .
" nothing will be discussed that is not already in the public domain , " marconi 's mr hobson told bbc news .
mr hobson said that the meeting was to discuss the company 's recent earnings report and the company 's current operational status .
according to the financial times , the dti is concerned that marconi may be tempted to shift r & d jobs overseas after signing a major deal with china 's huawei technologies .
marconi 's chief executive was quoted as saying that marconi planned to keep at least part of its r & d operations in the uk .
the government is under increasing pressure to protect uk jobs after a number of high-profile problems , most notably the recent collapse of carmaking firm mg rover .

scotland 's first minister jack mcconnell is on a visit to malawi .
sir bob challenged politicians not just to talk but act in advance , he received a little advice from the architect of live aid .
sir bob -lrb- for so he is styled for his years of effort -rrb- was at holyrood to contribute to a day of discussions about scotland 's burgeoning african connection .
he smiled as excited youngsters sought autographs and pressed their mobile phone cameras .
but he was grimly serious as he warned the first minister - " and i am putting him on the spot here " - that he must address the issue of political corruption in africa too .
it was particularly incumbent upon scotland , he argued , to use its fledgling parliament , revived only six years ago , to underpin efforts to entrench honest , open democracy in africa .
mr mcconnell nodded .
he gets the concept .
we are dealing here with one of the poorest nations on earth responding , he stressed that he believed he could bolster the commendable efforts of malawi 's president who was elected on a reform ticket .
but why scotland ?
why now ?
why malawi ?
what difference can this project make ?
all relevant questions for scotland - a country of five million people with a devolved executive and parliament , part of the much larger united kingdom .
constitutionally , international aid is reserved to the uk government in westminster .
but , on this issue , jack mcconnell is impatient with that formal division - and he insists that he has the blessing of uk ministers to target scotland 's relatively limited aid capacity on malawi .
president bingu wa mutharika won a disputed election in 2004 confronted with a crisis , one can not afford to be too precious .
but why malawi ?
history - and need .
malawi is the african nation most closely connected with the great scottish explorer , david livingston .
blantyre in malawi is named after livingston 's scottish birthplace .
and the kirk , the church of scotland , built very close links with malawi in livingston 's footsteps .
and the difference ?
scotland will not transform malawi .
special relationship we are dealing here with one of the poorest nations on earth .
so the connection planned is pragmatic rather than grandiose .
help for struggling hospitals , help for determined but underfunded schools .
help on the ground .
help where it matters .
scotland is not " twinning " with malawi .
that sounds rather too municipal , too low-key .
jack mcconnell certainly appears to be personally passionate about this endeavour scotland is certainly not " adopting " malawi .
africa has been patronised enough .
perhaps , just perhaps , scotland has identified a special friend in africa : a friend with special needs .
it is easy to be cynical about politics .
one looks for the edge , the angle , in everything .
but jack mcconnell certainly appears to be personally passionate about this endeavour .
a former teacher , he speaks of his " anger " that young people in malawi are denied opportunities .
perhaps denied life , given the high infant mortality rate .
scotland , therefore , has chosen to focus : to draw together government aid , professional support and voluntary back-up .
hiv / aids is a serious threat to health in parts of africa instead of spreading that aid thinly , the assistance is to be directed towards malawi .
medics and midwives from scotland are already there , working at bottom hospital , a grim facility in lilongwe which delivers 11,000 babies a year .
scotland is supporting nurse training .
and pupils from sanday in the orkney isles are visiting a school in malawi .
more , much more , will follow .
the project has cross-party support in scotland .
earlier , in february , members of the scottish parliament toured malawi - including bottom hospital -lrb- so named to distinguish it from another facility at the top of an adjacent hill -rrb- .
their report tells of poverty , illness , hiv / aids , desperation .
but it also tells of hope : of resilience , rather .
a refusal to succumb utterly .
jack mcconnell believes his executive can help to build upon that emotion , that determination .
in a small way , yes , but in a practical way .
world leaders will be gathering at gleneagles now , of course , there is another perspective .
a legitimate perspective which argues that continuing aid merely masks underlying , structural problems in africa : that african nations must be exhorted to follow the example of south-east asia in lifting their economy out of subsistence struggle .
which prompts another issue .
should we assist africa - or should we , particularly in the european union , lift the trade blockages which arguably hinder african nations as much as the aid projects help them ?
relevant , legitimate arguments , all .
key topics to discuss at the gleneagles g8 summit in scotland in early july .
key issues for the demonstrators who will accompany that summit .
perhaps scottish voices will be added to that debate .
but perhaps , in the bygoing , we might also find time to provide malawi with books and medicine .

the bbc 's michael osborn reports from the ukrainian capital on the atmosphere from the world 's biggest musical event .
sunday 22 may 1300 local time -lrb- 1100 bst -rrb- it 's a serious case of the morning after the night before in the ukrainian capital .
eurovision is all over for another year , and there are clear signs that the party has finished .
the scene in kiev 's independence square on saturday there is nothing more than a relaxed hum in the press centre , and the canteen has closed for business already .
they 're playing depeche mode now - not all this year 's eurovision entries on a continuous loop .
walking through kiev at daybreak , it was clear that the ukrainians were winding down the celebrations too .
the crowds in independence square had been replaced by an army of rubbish collectors , while there was a strong tang of sour beer in the air .
the evening 's excitement kicked off earlier with a seemingly ordinary meal at one of kiev 's irish bars with a clutch of fellow journalists .
our walk to the bar gave us a taste of the electric atmosphere in the jam-packed square .
then we were made an offer which was impossible to turn down - tickets to be part of the audience at the live eurovision final .
a group of irish fans had decided there was not much point going to watch when their country was no longer in the reckoning .
it seems the luck of the irish smiled on us , which resulted in a strangely unforgettable experience .
as the voting drew to a close , our thoughts turned to why the uk had failed to impress yet again .
we decided it was because our attitude to eurovision is cool and distant .
let 's hope that by the time eurovision 2006 comes around , we will have had a long , hard think about what has gone so wrong .
friday 20 may 1700 local time -lrb- 1500 bst -rrb- i was sitting in the press centre minding my own business and was gently persuaded to interview israeli singer shiri maymon , who made an entrance in sunglasses with a small entourage .
" i was surprised that i got through , but it feels good , " said the semi-final qualifier .
ms maymon 's powerful ballad will be sandwiched between up-tempo and folk-flavoured songs in the grand final , which could work in her favour .
the performer added that with only malta fielding a slower number , the two countries have only one another for competition .
the uk might not be the only country which feels hard done by with eurovision voting , according to ms maymon .
" israel has suffered from political voting in the past few years , and we hope it 's not going to happen this year , " she said .
switzerland and norway are the israeli 's favourite songs , but she has yet to see javine 's performance .
during the interview a mini media scrum developed .
it was quite nice to have got the ball rolling .
friday 20 may 1200 local time -lrb- 1000bst -rrb- a belarus fan reacts to his country 's exit the wet weather in kiev seems to be reflecting the mood of last night 's unsuccessful semi-finalists .
ireland , eurovision champions of all time , could n't even make it into the premiership this year .
a few dejected irish supporters were being interviewed in the lobby of my hotel , while a number of finns looked like they were heading home this morning .
and the exit of highly favoured iceland caused a number of eurovision pundits in the press centre to gasp .
texts from back home suggest that moldova 's zany drumming grandmother was the big favourite with uk voters .
but the wet weather has n't put a dampener on the ukrainian capital - flag sellers on the edges of independence square offer all the competing nations , plus the likes of brazil and iraq for good measure .
i nearly bought a union jack , but then found my allegiances wavering .
this eurovision business can do strange things to your sense of national identity .
thursday 19 may 1630 local time -lrb- 1430bst -rrb- there 's a buzz in the air ahead of tonight 's semi-final , and the party seems to be getting started under the blistering summer sun of ukraine .
eurovision has descended on one of the former ussr 's largest cities but away from planet eurovision , the people of kiev seem be going about their business as usual .
i ventured out on to the streets and took the city 's metro .
with doors that can cut a reporter in half and nothing but good fortune to cling onto , it 's not for the faint-hearted .
i headed out to eurovision 's very own campsite , a tent city on an island in the dnipro river .
it was a real slog to get there and i 've caught an unnaturally healthy colour on my nose and cheeks .
i 'll stick to my hotel , thank you .
on the way back to the sports palace i saw a stern statue of lenin looking out on to kiev 's main thoroughfare .
he would n't be a happy man if he knew the eurovision song contest had finally made it to one of the soviet union 's biggest cities .
earlier in the womb-like press centre , there was a sudden media scrum .
i expected it was one of the singers an appearance , but it was a man i did n't recognise - and there was n't a sequin in sight .
apparently it was a very famous ukrainian footballer .
it seems everyone wants a slice of the eurovision action .
thursday 19 may 1015 local time -lrb- 0815bst -rrb- i decided to skip the bus ride to the sports palace and took a walk through the heart of a warm , sunny kiev .
the city cut an impressive sight with glinting gold-topped monuments and wide , tree-lined boulevards .
over a breakfast of sweaty cheese i turned my thoughts to the evening 's semi-final .
after a sneak glimpse of the show last night , the usual eurovision mix of showy performances , glittery frocks and gimmicks is in store .
a statue of lenin looks out over kiev 's main thoroughfare my advice is to keep your eyes peeled for the belarusian entry , while moldova and romania have also pulled out all the stops to tickle the fancy of voters .
a journalist from ireland persuaded me the night was still young , and we went to check out euroclub , a huge venue devoted to eurovision partying .
there was a mediterranean love-in going on , with the greek , cypriot and maltese hopefuls doing a lively turn on a raised platform .
it got really crowded as the ukrainian group joined the fray .
but the strangest spot so far was the lead singer of norway 's glam rock band careering around the hotel in what appeared to be a long pink dressing gown .
wednesday 18 may 2005 1930 local time -lrb- 1730bst -rrb- after a long , torturous journey to kiev , i have finally landed on planet eurovision .
the ukrainian capital seems to be geared up for the occasion , with every other poster proclaiming the country 's eurovision slogan - awakening .
the city is fast filling up with devotees from all corners of europe , along with plenty more hard-bitten reporters who are being housed in a giant inflatable tent at the sports palace , the cavernous venue for eurovision .
the hard-bitten fans take some beating .
one man 's mobile phone rang out with the opening refrain of hungary 's entry - and that was n't the only one he had .
there is no escaping eurovision fever in kiev home for the next few days is a grand soviet-era hotel overlooking kiev 's independence square .
the orange revolution was replaced with a big city centre concert with - you guessed it - a eurovision theme .
it 's going to be hard to live and breathe anything other than the song contest on this trip east .

" israel has suffered from political voting in the past few years , and we hope it 's not going to happen this year , " she said .
switzerland and norway are the israeli 's favourite songs , but she has yet to see javine 's performance .
during the interview a mini media scrum developed .
it was quite nice to have got the ball rolling .
friday 20 may 1200 local time -lrb- 1000bst -rrb- a belarus fan reacts to his country 's exit the wet weather in kiev seems to be reflecting the mood of last night 's unsuccessful semi-finalists .
ireland , eurovision champions of all time , could n't even make it into the premiership this year .
a few dejected irish supporters were being interviewed in the lobby of my hotel , while a number of finns looked like they were heading home this morning .
and the exit of highly favoured iceland caused a number of eurovision pundits in the press centre to gasp .
texts from back home suggest that moldova 's zany drumming grandmother was the big favourite with uk voters .
but the wet weather has n't put a dampener on the ukrainian capital - flag sellers on the edges of independence square offer all the competing nations , plus the likes of brazil and iraq for good measure .
i nearly bought a union jack , but then found my allegiances wavering .
this eurovision business can do strange things to your sense of national identity .
thursday 19 may 1630 local time -lrb- 1430bst -rrb- there 's a buzz in the air ahead of tonight 's semi-final , and the party seems to be getting started under the blistering summer sun of ukraine .
eurovision has descended on one of the former ussr 's largest cities but away from planet eurovision , the people of kiev seem be going about their business as usual .
i ventured out on to the streets and took the city 's metro .
with doors that can cut a reporter in half and nothing but good fortune to cling onto , it 's not for the faint-hearted .
i headed out to eurovision 's very own campsite , a tent city on an island in the dnipro river .
it was a real slog to get there and i 've caught an unnaturally healthy colour on my nose and cheeks .
i 'll stick to my hotel , thank you .
on the way back to the sports palace i saw a stern statue of lenin looking out on to kiev 's main thoroughfare .
he would n't be a happy man if he knew the eurovision song contest had finally made it to one of the soviet union 's biggest cities .
earlier in the womb-like press centre , there was a sudden media scrum .
i expected it was one of the singers an appearance , but it was a man i did n't recognise - and there was n't a sequin in sight .
apparently it was a very famous ukrainian footballer .
it seems everyone wants a slice of the eurovision action .
thursday 19 may 1015 local time -lrb- 0815bst -rrb- i decided to skip the bus ride to the sports palace and took a walk through the heart of a warm , sunny kiev .
the city cut an impressive sight with glinting gold-topped monuments and wide , tree-lined boulevards .
over a breakfast of sweaty cheese i turned my thoughts to the evening 's semi-final .
after a sneak glimpse of the show last night , the usual eurovision mix of showy performances , glittery frocks and gimmicks is in store .
a statue of lenin looks out over kiev 's main thoroughfare my advice is to keep your eyes peeled for the belarusian entry , while moldova and romania have also pulled out all the stops to tickle the fancy of voters .
a journalist from ireland persuaded me the night was still young , and we went to check out euroclub , a huge venue devoted to eurovision partying .
there was a mediterranean love-in going on , with the greek , cypriot and maltese hopefuls doing a lively turn on a raised platform .
it got really crowded as the ukrainian group joined the fray .
but the strangest spot so far was the lead singer of norway 's glam rock band careering around the hotel in what appeared to be a long pink dressing gown .
wednesday 18 may 2005 1930 local time -lrb- 1730bst -rrb- after a long , torturous journey to kiev , i have finally landed on planet eurovision .
the ukrainian capital seems to be geared up for the occasion , with every other poster proclaiming the country 's eurovision slogan - awakening .
the city is fast filling up with devotees from all corners of europe , along with plenty more hard-bitten reporters who are being housed in a giant inflatable tent at the sports palace , the cavernous venue for eurovision .
the hard-bitten fans take some beating .
one man 's mobile phone rang out with the opening refrain of hungary 's entry - and that was n't the only one he had .
there is no escaping eurovision fever in kiev home for the next few days is a grand soviet-era hotel overlooking kiev 's independence square .
the orange revolution was replaced with a big city centre concert with - you guessed it - a eurovision theme .
it 's going to be hard to live and breathe anything other than the song contest on this trip east .
