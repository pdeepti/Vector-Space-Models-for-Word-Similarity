" the other 21 eu states are still a long way off track in terms of their promise ... this is inexcusable , " the report stated . those eu states that avoided the report 's scorn included luxembourg , which gives 0.8 percent of gni in aid , and sweden , which has also met the 0.7 percent target , saying these in particular deserved " gold stars " for their efforts .

" on current trends , germany will not reach the 0.7 percent until 2087 , which is a long way from being in the ' medium term ' , " the report said . italy also found itself in the firing line : " italy is one of the world 's wealthiest nations , yet it gives only a miserly 0.17 percent of its gni in aid .

" why should we not welcome the use of technology ? " asked german rehhagel .
" it would allow things to be established straight away and we just need to get used to little breaks in our game .
that is the case in other sports . " the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has made an official request for fifa , soccer 's world governing body , to start using video coverage to observe officials and analyze incidents such as whether the ball crosses the goal-line .
the request was a response to the scandal in which berlin referee robert hoyzer recently admitting to fixing four matches for financial gain .
but oliver bierhoff , assistant coach of the german national team , said technology is not the answer to the problem .
" i think we should do without video evidence , " said bierhoff .
" the game needs to flow and it is difficult to say where you begin and end with the whole video coverage .
there will always be mistakes in football . "
fifa president sepp blatter expressed similar sentiments : " as long as i am fifa president there will not be video coverage . football is a game for the people .
players , managers and referees are only human and make mistakes . " dw-world.de disgraced german referee arrested disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer , who has admitted accepting bribes to manipulate matches , was arrested by police on saturday amid fears that he would try to flee the country .

the zew economic research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 318 analysts and institutional investors , rose by 9.0 points to plus 35.9 points in february , after already rising sharply the preceding month , zew said in a statement .

zew president wolfgang franz said : " a positive factor may have been the sharp increase in manufacturing orders in december .
in particular , domestic demand for capital goods showed its biggest increase in more than 10 years , so that this can be seen as a signal for a noticeable improvement the domestic economy this year . "

zew president wolfgang franz said : " a positive factor may have been the sharp increase in manufacturing orders in december .

the zew economic research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 318 analysts and institutional investors , rose by 9.0 points to plus 35.9 points in february , after already rising sharply the preceding month , zew said in a statement .
it was the highest level since september 2004 and puts investor confidence back above its long-term average of plus 34.4 points .
the zew barometer had already risen in january and the magnitude of the increase this month similarly caught analysts by surprise .
consensus forecasts had been for a more modest rise to around 30 points in the february index from 26.9 points in january .
zew president wolfgang franz said : " a positive factor may have been the sharp increase in manufacturing orders in december .
in particular , domestic demand for capital goods showed its biggest increase in more than 10 years , so that this can be seen as a signal for a noticeable improvement the domestic economy this year . "
the zew indicator represents the balance between positive and negative expectations for the economy over the next six months . dw-world.de economists , industry pin hopes on 2005 after several years of stagnation , the german economy has begun showing signs of life and some economists and industry leaders say they are cautiously optimistic about 2005 .

only four managed to meet the internationally agreed aid quota . in a report that names and shames some of the european union 's richest states , a number of non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- have accused the likes of germany and italy of keeping their purse strings tightened when it comes to helping the world 's poorest countries the report released on monday by action aid , eurodad and oxfam accuses europe 's misers in the wake of the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- meeting during which the world 's wealthiest nations pledged to rid the world 's poorest countries of their crippling debt but failed to meet africa 's demand for immediate action . the european relief agencies published a damning critique of member states ' efforts to address the issue , saying that g7 countries such as germany and italy did too little to meet a united nations target to reduce poverty in the world by 2015 . eu majority are " way off track " the combined data showed that only four eu states had fulfilled a promise made in 1970 by the world 's rich countries to give 0.7 percent of their gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- as foreign aid .
" the other 21 eu states are still a long way off track in terms of their promise ... this is inexcusable , " the report stated . those eu states that avoided the report 's scorn included luxembourg , which gives 0.8 percent of gni in aid , and sweden , which has also met the 0.7 percent target , saying these in particular deserved " gold stars " for their efforts .
the report also praised the netherlands for giving 0.81 percent , but said its gold star was at risk because the government wanted to count security-related expenditures as aid . even euro champ gets stingier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's " leading champion " was denmark , which currently pays the most of all eu states with 0.84 percent .
however , there were reservations in the report as to denmark 's future intentions as the danish government had been cutting down on aid spending since 2001 , when it gave 1.03 percent . " the eu must take positive action on three issues : improving the quantity and quality of international aid ; easing the burden of unsustainable debt ; and making the rules for world trade fairer , " the report stated . germany 's goal overly optimistic , says report singling out german chancellor gerhard schröder , the leader of the eu 's largest economy , for particular criticism , the report said that schröder 's promise at the world economic forum in davos that germany would reach the 0.7 percent goal in the " medium term " was optimistic at best .
" on current trends , germany will not reach the 0.7 percent until 2087 , which is a long way from being in the ' medium term ' , " the report said . italy also found itself in the firing line : " italy is one of the world 's wealthiest nations , yet it gives only a miserly 0.17 percent of its gni in aid . " g7 indecision compounds aid misery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministers of the group of seven major industrial countries .
despite the efforts of british finance minister gordon brown , who presented a plan for helping africa in what he called a " make or break year , " the g7 failed to agree on the proposals which would have freed up an extra € 38.4 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year for poor countries and completely write off their debts . an agreement was eventually reached on the subject of debt relief but the increase in cash remained contentious . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

statistics from berlin 's education department show that almost 19 percent of the 560 cases of school violence registered in 2003 - 04 took place on the way to school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , an investigation by the federal criminal office found that 5 percent of all students regularly engaged in violence ; a third occasionally indulged in fights .
a separate study by the weisser ring , an association for crime victims , found that every third student was too scared to cross the schoolyard during recess or even step on to the road leading to the school .
every second girl said she was frightened on the way to school and back home . " the quality of violence has increased and in a negative way , " said ludwig eckinger , vde national head .

if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .

i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .

the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .

on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .

i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .

dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .

to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .

if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .

" since june the work has been at a standstill while we 've had to put out one fire after another , " beckenbauer said . the dfb is being jointly run until the world cup is over by outgoing gerhard mayer-vorfelder and incoming theo zwanziger .
beckenbauer said the co-presidency was n't working .
" the co-presidency was decided in good faith but it can not work , " beckenbauer said .

" every sports newspaper in the world is writing about this , " beckenbauer said .
" naturally , that is creating a negative image . "
he said that in the interests of the world cup he hoped the scandal would be " cleared up as quickly as possible .

the files includes fixtures from the bundesliga , german cup , friendlies and an indoor competition .
hoyzer acted as referee in 36 of them , assistant referee in six others and supervisory referee in the remaining 21 . hoyzer admitted in january to fixing several matches in return for cash from the croatian bookmaking mafia .
he is believed to have received a total of € 67,000 -lrb- $ 87,200 -rrb- and a plasma television screen for manipulating the games .
hoyzer was arrested and placed in police custody on saturday because of fears he might flee the country . repeat of rigged game a dfb sport panel also decided on tuesday for the first time to repeat a second league game between lr ahlen and wacker burghausen that hoyzer apparently rigged .
the game originally took place last october with a 1:0 victory for ahlen .
hoyzer has admitted that he manipulated it with deliberate foul judgments . " hoyzer is a notorious liar , " said ahlen 's legal counsel christoph schickhardt .
" until saturday he believed he was in the movies and the main protagonist , " schickhardt said referring to hoyzer 's television appearance on various talk shows before his arrest . the soccer federation also suspended another second-division referee , dominik marks , on tuesday .
marks is said to be " seriously suspected " of fixing two games last year for which he reportedly pocketed € 36,000 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced german referee arrested disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer , who has admitted accepting bribes to manipulate matches , was arrested by police on saturday amid fears that he would try to flee the country .

dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2005 fear in the schoolyard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just simple teasing schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .
teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . helge dietrich says that his students ' favorite expression is " son of a bitch . " a teacher at a high school in berlin 's mitte district and state chairman of the trade union for teachers -lrb- vde -rrb- , dietrich has been observing an increase in rowdy behavior at schools in berlin .
" it does n't take very long for verbal abuse to then turn into fisticuffs , " dietrich said . dietrich 's experience illustrates what his organization and the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- were trying to draw attention to at a meeting in berlin on monday : that violence in german schools is on the rise . schools helpless various studies support the claim .
statistics from berlin 's education department show that almost 19 percent of the 560 cases of school violence registered in 2003 - 04 took place on the way to school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , an investigation by the federal criminal office found that 5 percent of all students regularly engaged in violence ; a third occasionally indulged in fights .
a separate study by the weisser ring , an association for crime victims , found that every third student was too scared to cross the schoolyard during recess or even step on to the road leading to the school .
every second girl said she was frightened on the way to school and back home . " the quality of violence has increased and in a negative way , " said ludwig eckinger , vde national head .
" that means students are ready to hit more quickly even when their so-called victim is already injured .
we 're observing this aggressive behavior in all kinds of school and all over the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aggressive behavior at school can take many forms - from bullying a fellow student , abusing him , jostling him , stealing his jacket or sneakers to actual physical injury .
most teachers and schools are said to be overwhelmed by the dimensions of the problem . closer links between schools and police to counter the growing menace , the vde and the dpolg unveiled a new initiative in berlin on monday which foresees an intensified cooperation between schools and the police . wolfgang speck , chairman of the dpolg pointed out that school teachers and police in germany have already been working together for decades when it comes to teaching traffic sense and regulations to students or providing them information on the dangers of drug abuse .
the two can now work together along the same lines when it comes to containing violence at schools , speck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed police enter the gutenberg school in erfurt on april 26 , 2002 after a student ran amok and killed 18 people .
in future , uniformed officers are expected to be a regular feature in school corridors .
police officials will also conduct preventive classes in dealing with violence , which is already the case in some german states , including berlin . the new initiative also foresees every school having their own contact person in the next police station and vice versa .
they are expected to exchange information on potentially violent students .
" that means that when a violent incident takes place at a school the designated police officer arrives there as soon as possible .
that gives the message : when something untoward happens the police are there , " said speck . the close contact between schools and the cops is also meant to build trust , in particular among young foreign students who often have bad experiences with the police in their countries of origin . hurdles to overcome the concept already seems to be working in some places , such as the school in berlin where helge dietrich teaches .
" the police who come to our school , go into the classrooms and make it clear to the students what violence actually is , " said dietrich .
" they also familiarize the students with how they can deescalate violence . " despite the optimism surrounding the new initiative , cooperation between the police and schools is not expected to be all smooth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to the fact that many states are unable to fund such projects in the face of dwindling coffers , the police 's demand that all offenses at school be reported to them are also said to be unpopular among school directors worried that it might damage the reputation of their institutions . " actually every school director should be happy about such offers -lrb- of cooperation with the police -rrb- and one must be ready to learn that what is a deficit is n't necessarily a statement on how bad a school is , " said eckinger .
" instead , the director should say , ' we want to solve the problem ' . " that 's also a reason why the police suspect that the actual cases of violence at schools may be much higher than the statistics show , given that many simply go unreported . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de school violence trial begins in germany a whole german school class accused of torturing a fellow-student goes on trial tuesday .

" since june the work has been at a standstill while we 've had to put out one fire after another , " beckenbauer said . the dfb is being jointly run until the world cup is over by outgoing gerhard mayer-vorfelder and incoming theo zwanziger .
beckenbauer said the co-presidency was n't working .
" the co-presidency was decided in good faith but it can not work , " beckenbauer said .
" too much effort is being wasted on side issues .
but we have to live with this compromise .
we 've taken the responsibility and we have to see it through . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german footballers bernd schneider -lrb- bayer leverkusen , right -rrb- und robert huth -lrb- fc chelsea london -rrb- with the world cup mascot .
referring to the match-fixing scandal , which has taken on unforeseen proportions , beckenbauer said it was tarnishing german soccer 's image at a sensitive time when the country is readying to host the world cup next year .
" every sports newspaper in the world is writing about this , " beckenbauer said .
" naturally , that is creating a negative image . "
he said that in the interests of the world cup he hoped the scandal would be " cleared up as quickly as possible . " ref to be quizzed over 63 matches on tuesday , further wide-reaching revelations emerged from the deepening match-fixing scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer robert hoyzer , the referee in the eye of the scandal , is to be grilled by police on a total of 63 games he was involved in , the dfb announced . the federation has handed the list of matches to police in berlin investigating the 25-year-old who last month admitted manipulating results for cash .
the files includes fixtures from the bundesliga , german cup , friendlies and an indoor competition .
hoyzer acted as referee in 36 of them , assistant referee in six others and supervisory referee in the remaining 21 . hoyzer admitted in january to fixing several matches in return for cash from the croatian bookmaking mafia .
he is believed to have received a total of € 67,000 -lrb- $ 87,200 -rrb- and a plasma television screen for manipulating the games .
hoyzer was arrested and placed in police custody on saturday because of fears he might flee the country . repeat of rigged game a dfb sport panel also decided on tuesday for the first time to repeat a second league game between lr ahlen and wacker burghausen that hoyzer apparently rigged .
the game originally took place last october with a 1:0 victory for ahlen .
hoyzer has admitted that he manipulated it with deliberate foul judgments . " hoyzer is a notorious liar , " said ahlen 's legal counsel christoph schickhardt .
" until saturday he believed he was in the movies and the main protagonist , " schickhardt said referring to hoyzer 's television appearance on various talk shows before his arrest . the soccer federation also suspended another second-division referee , dominik marks , on tuesday .
marks is said to be " seriously suspected " of fixing two games last year for which he reportedly pocketed € 36,000 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced german referee arrested disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer , who has admitted accepting bribes to manipulate matches , was arrested by police on saturday amid fears that he would try to flee the country .

teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . helge dietrich says that his students ' favorite expression is " son of a bitch . " a teacher at a high school in berlin 's mitte district and state chairman of the trade union for teachers -lrb- vde -rrb- , dietrich has been observing an increase in rowdy behavior at schools in berlin .
" it does n't take very long for verbal abuse to then turn into fisticuffs , " dietrich said . dietrich 's experience illustrates what his organization and the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- were trying to draw attention to at a meeting in berlin on monday : that violence in german schools is on the rise . schools helpless various studies support the claim .
statistics from berlin 's education department show that almost 19 percent of the 560 cases of school violence registered in 2003 - 04 took place on the way to school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , an investigation by the federal criminal office found that 5 percent of all students regularly engaged in violence ; a third occasionally indulged in fights .
a separate study by the weisser ring , an association for crime victims , found that every third student was too scared to cross the schoolyard during recess or even step on to the road leading to the school .
every second girl said she was frightened on the way to school and back home . " the quality of violence has increased and in a negative way , " said ludwig eckinger , vde national head .
" that means students are ready to hit more quickly even when their so-called victim is already injured .
we 're observing this aggressive behavior in all kinds of school and all over the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aggressive behavior at school can take many forms - from bullying a fellow student , abusing him , jostling him , stealing his jacket or sneakers to actual physical injury .
most teachers and schools are said to be overwhelmed by the dimensions of the problem . closer links between schools and police to counter the growing menace , the vde and the dpolg unveiled a new initiative in berlin on monday which foresees an intensified cooperation between schools and the police . wolfgang speck , chairman of the dpolg pointed out that school teachers and police in germany have already been working together for decades when it comes to teaching traffic sense and regulations to students or providing them information on the dangers of drug abuse .
the two can now work together along the same lines when it comes to containing violence at schools , speck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed police enter the gutenberg school in erfurt on april 26 , 2002 after a student ran amok and killed 18 people .
in future , uniformed officers are expected to be a regular feature in school corridors .
police officials will also conduct preventive classes in dealing with violence , which is already the case in some german states , including berlin . the new initiative also foresees every school having their own contact person in the next police station and vice versa .
they are expected to exchange information on potentially violent students .
" that means that when a violent incident takes place at a school the designated police officer arrives there as soon as possible .
that gives the message : when something untoward happens the police are there , " said speck . the close contact between schools and the cops is also meant to build trust , in particular among young foreign students who often have bad experiences with the police in their countries of origin . hurdles to overcome the concept already seems to be working in some places , such as the school in berlin where helge dietrich teaches .
" the police who come to our school , go into the classrooms and make it clear to the students what violence actually is , " said dietrich .
" they also familiarize the students with how they can deescalate violence . " despite the optimism surrounding the new initiative , cooperation between the police and schools is not expected to be all smooth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to the fact that many states are unable to fund such projects in the face of dwindling coffers , the police 's demand that all offenses at school be reported to them are also said to be unpopular among school directors worried that it might damage the reputation of their institutions . " actually every school director should be happy about such offers -lrb- of cooperation with the police -rrb- and one must be ready to learn that what is a deficit is n't necessarily a statement on how bad a school is , " said eckinger .
" instead , the director should say , ' we want to solve the problem ' . " that 's also a reason why the police suspect that the actual cases of violence at schools may be much higher than the statistics show , given that many simply go unreported . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de school violence trial begins in germany a whole german school class accused of torturing a fellow-student goes on trial tuesday .

if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .
traces of the militarily dubious decision to bomb the city remain visible today .
-lrb- feb .
13 , 2005 -rrb- the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .
the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation .

if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.02.2005 can fischer weather the storm ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer could have been aware of the problem earlier than believed the german foreign minister 's attention was allegedly drawn to visa abuse in eastern europe two years ago .
amid calls for his resignation , can he take the heat ?
and what does his besmirched reputation mean for his party ? a day after foreign minister joschka fischer accepted the blame for the visa scandal , the rheinische post rubbed salt into the wound by revealing the top german diplomat had been aware of the issue for longer than previously believed - quoting a ministerial memo from march 19 , 2003 . " mass use of tourist visas has led to a considerable rise in application numbers in the commonwealth of independent states and has been exploited for several months by traffickers , " the memo said . the paper pointed out that fischer himself has said he only became aware of the problem in 2004 . opposition seizes its opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , leader of the opposition christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said tuesday that once fischer has appeared before the parliamentary commission investigating the allegations against the foreign ministry , it would be time to decide whether his political accountability would have personal consequences . in an interview with daily die welt , stoiber said that if so , fischer " would have to leave office , " adding that " the public has a right to know exactly what role the minister responsible played in the arrival of organized criminals from eastern europe . " fall-out for the coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludger volmer the accusations revolve around the foreign ministry 's controversial relaxation of restrictions on travel from march 2000 until last year , overseen by fischer 's deputy , ludger volmer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
critics say the new rules played into the hands of human traffickers and potential terrorists . whether or not the allegations of abuse prove true , the extensive media coverage threatens to erase the recent gains made in the polls by the governing social democrat-greens coalition , just days ahead of significant local elections in the northern state of schleswig-holstein - where opinion polls give the government a narrow lead - and three months before a crucial vote in the important industrial state of north rhine-westphalia . fischer under fire fischer , the figurehead of the green party and a key ally of chancellor schröder , is consistently rated germany 's most popular politician .
the opposition has always been quick to pounce on ways of undermining him - after all , slinging mud at the reputation of the coalition 's charismatic foreign minister is an easy way of damaging the government . fischer is standing his ground in the face of the oppositions ' allegations .
although he might have accepted responsibility , he 's also suggested the issue has been exaggerated .
" it 's not as if criminal people-trafficking began under the red-green coaltion .
it 's not as if forced prostitution began with red-green , " he said monday referring to the greens ' coalition with schröder 's spd .
" it 's not as if there were not considerable pressure from the previous government , " he pointed out . the greens come of age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily , former green member , now social democrat and interior minister in the federal government the affair has already led to the resignation of ludger volmer , and as fischer now struggles to retain his own credibility , the clouds of suspicion are also drifting towards interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- , another old-school green- turned-spd . jörg schönbohm , csu interior minister of the eastern german state of brandenburg , accused schily of failing to oppose what has been dubbed the " volmer decree , " the relaxing of visa restrictions that have led to the current scandal . a big scandal for a grown-up party ? many in germany will be noting that the affair has resulted in the first black mark on the greens ' hitherto unblemished report card .
while other parties have seen their integrity chipped away by scandals and mismanagement , the greens have managed to maintain a relatively squeaky-clean reputation since entering government in 1998 .

" mass use of tourist visas has led to a considerable rise in application numbers in the commonwealth of independent states and has been exploited for several months by traffickers , " the memo said . the paper pointed out that fischer himself has said he only became aware of the problem in 2004 . opposition seizes its opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , leader of the opposition christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said tuesday that once fischer has appeared before the parliamentary commission investigating the allegations against the foreign ministry , it would be time to decide whether his political accountability would have personal consequences . in an interview with daily die welt , stoiber said that if so , fischer " would have to leave office , " adding that " the public has a right to know exactly what role the minister responsible played in the arrival of organized criminals from eastern europe .

critics say the new rules played into the hands of human traffickers and potential terrorists . whether or not the allegations of abuse prove true , the extensive media coverage threatens to erase the recent gains made in the polls by the governing social democrat-greens coalition , just days ahead of significant local elections in the northern state of schleswig-holstein - where opinion polls give the government a narrow lead - and three months before a crucial vote in the important industrial state of north rhine-westphalia . fischer under fire fischer , the figurehead of the green party and a key ally of chancellor schröder , is consistently rated germany 's most popular politician .
the opposition has always been quick to pounce on ways of undermining him - after all , slinging mud at the reputation of the coalition 's charismatic foreign minister is an easy way of damaging the government . fischer is standing his ground in the face of the oppositions ' allegations .
although he might have accepted responsibility , he 's also suggested the issue has been exaggerated .
" it 's not as if criminal people-trafficking began under the red-green coaltion .

while other parties have seen their integrity chipped away by scandals and mismanagement , the greens have managed to maintain a relatively squeaky-clean reputation since entering government in 1998 .

if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .
traces of the militarily dubious decision to bomb the city remain visible today .
-lrb- feb .
13 , 2005 -rrb- the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .

and what does his besmirched reputation mean for his party ? a day after foreign minister joschka fischer accepted the blame for the visa scandal , the rheinische post rubbed salt into the wound by revealing the top german diplomat had been aware of the issue for longer than previously believed - quoting a ministerial memo from march 19 , 2003 . " mass use of tourist visas has led to a considerable rise in application numbers in the commonwealth of independent states and has been exploited for several months by traffickers , " the memo said . the paper pointed out that fischer himself has said he only became aware of the problem in 2004 . opposition seizes its opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , leader of the opposition christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said tuesday that once fischer has appeared before the parliamentary commission investigating the allegations against the foreign ministry , it would be time to decide whether his political accountability would have personal consequences . in an interview with daily die welt , stoiber said that if so , fischer " would have to leave office , " adding that " the public has a right to know exactly what role the minister responsible played in the arrival of organized criminals from eastern europe . " fall-out for the coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludger volmer the accusations revolve around the foreign ministry 's controversial relaxation of restrictions on travel from march 2000 until last year , overseen by fischer 's deputy , ludger volmer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
critics say the new rules played into the hands of human traffickers and potential terrorists . whether or not the allegations of abuse prove true , the extensive media coverage threatens to erase the recent gains made in the polls by the governing social democrat-greens coalition , just days ahead of significant local elections in the northern state of schleswig-holstein - where opinion polls give the government a narrow lead - and three months before a crucial vote in the important industrial state of north rhine-westphalia . fischer under fire fischer , the figurehead of the green party and a key ally of chancellor schröder , is consistently rated germany 's most popular politician .
the opposition has always been quick to pounce on ways of undermining him - after all , slinging mud at the reputation of the coalition 's charismatic foreign minister is an easy way of damaging the government . fischer is standing his ground in the face of the oppositions ' allegations .
although he might have accepted responsibility , he 's also suggested the issue has been exaggerated .
" it 's not as if criminal people-trafficking began under the red-green coaltion .
it 's not as if forced prostitution began with red-green , " he said monday referring to the greens ' coalition with schröder 's spd .
" it 's not as if there were not considerable pressure from the previous government , " he pointed out . the greens come of age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily , former green member , now social democrat and interior minister in the federal government the affair has already led to the resignation of ludger volmer , and as fischer now struggles to retain his own credibility , the clouds of suspicion are also drifting towards interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- , another old-school green- turned-spd . jörg schönbohm , csu interior minister of the eastern german state of brandenburg , accused schily of failing to oppose what has been dubbed the " volmer decree , " the relaxing of visa restrictions that have led to the current scandal . a big scandal for a grown-up party ? many in germany will be noting that the affair has resulted in the first black mark on the greens ' hitherto unblemished report card .
while other parties have seen their integrity chipped away by scandals and mismanagement , the greens have managed to maintain a relatively squeaky-clean reputation since entering government in 1998 .

in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .

in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .

in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2005 the german problem with corruption großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament dome is transparent , but that 's about it a widening match-fixing scandal and revelation of politicians ' corporate salaries have sullied germany 's once clean image .
experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .
" the perception that germany has no corruption problem has absolutely nothing to do with reality , but rather with the fact that a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light , " said uwe dolata , press spokesman for the trade union representing germany 's criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- . the berlin-based arm of transparency international , a corruption watchdog , defines corruption as " the misuse of public or private economic power for private use . "
according to economists , corruption in germany results in lower tax revenues and higher state spending , amounting to losses of some € 200 billion -lrb- $ 259 billion -rrb- yearly . half-hearted laws ? in the face of such figures , the pressure is on to find effective ways to tackle the issue .
according to corruption experts , germany is n't doing enough to address the problem and needs to amend its body of law on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for instance , the rules on bribing members of the german or state parliament are so narrowly formulated that not a single case has been punished so far , " said dolata of the bdk . the law , which dates from 1994 , penalizes the " buying of votes " but only for voting rounds held in the german parliament or bundestag .
" you need to expand that law and also make corruption in other panels where preliminary political decisions are taken punishable , " said dagmar schröder , head of the german chapter of transparency international . experts cite germany 's 1999 international bribery law that forbids german companies from bribing members of parliament abroad as another example of regulations that do n't go far enough . " that means that if a german businessman greases the palms of a member of parliament abroad , he can be punished , " said dolata .
" but if he offers the same money to a german member of parliament , he ca n't be penalized . " taking pointers from scandinavia ? experts say that germany could pick up a few lessons in fighting corruption from scandinavian countries , who lead the way when it comes to battling fraud .
according to transparency international 's corruption index , finland is the least corrupt nation worldwide .
such a high ranking is linked to scandinavia 's dominating " culture of transparency , " said dagmar schröder and urged introducing a " glass member of parliament " concept for germany too , which would require politicians to publicly declare all their income . # b # a further area where germany has its work cut out is in the economic sector , which schröder said " is significantly more corrupt , in particular because the financial sums involved are so high . " transparency international is thus urging a corporate criminal law modeled on the one practiced in switzerland , whereby companies are held accountable for corruption cases .
in addition , the watchdog wants corrupt companies to be barred from receiving public contracts . angela göpfert -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced german referee arrested disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer , who has admitted accepting bribes to manipulate matches , was arrested by police on saturday amid fears that he would try to flee the country .

experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .
" the perception that germany has no corruption problem has absolutely nothing to do with reality , but rather with the fact that a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light , " said uwe dolata , press spokesman for the trade union representing germany 's criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- . the berlin-based arm of transparency international , a corruption watchdog , defines corruption as " the misuse of public or private economic power for private use . "
according to economists , corruption in germany results in lower tax revenues and higher state spending , amounting to losses of some € 200 billion -lrb- $ 259 billion -rrb- yearly . half-hearted laws ? in the face of such figures , the pressure is on to find effective ways to tackle the issue .
according to corruption experts , germany is n't doing enough to address the problem and needs to amend its body of law on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for instance , the rules on bribing members of the german or state parliament are so narrowly formulated that not a single case has been punished so far , " said dolata of the bdk . the law , which dates from 1994 , penalizes the " buying of votes " but only for voting rounds held in the german parliament or bundestag .
" you need to expand that law and also make corruption in other panels where preliminary political decisions are taken punishable , " said dagmar schröder , head of the german chapter of transparency international . experts cite germany 's 1999 international bribery law that forbids german companies from bribing members of parliament abroad as another example of regulations that do n't go far enough . " that means that if a german businessman greases the palms of a member of parliament abroad , he can be punished , " said dolata .
" but if he offers the same money to a german member of parliament , he ca n't be penalized . " taking pointers from scandinavia ? experts say that germany could pick up a few lessons in fighting corruption from scandinavian countries , who lead the way when it comes to battling fraud .
according to transparency international 's corruption index , finland is the least corrupt nation worldwide .
such a high ranking is linked to scandinavia 's dominating " culture of transparency , " said dagmar schröder and urged introducing a " glass member of parliament " concept for germany too , which would require politicians to publicly declare all their income . # b # a further area where germany has its work cut out is in the economic sector , which schröder said " is significantly more corrupt , in particular because the financial sums involved are so high . " transparency international is thus urging a corporate criminal law modeled on the one practiced in switzerland , whereby companies are held accountable for corruption cases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2005 the german problem with corruption großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament dome is transparent , but that 's about it a widening match-fixing scandal and revelation of politicians ' corporate salaries have sullied germany 's once clean image .
experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .
" the perception that germany has no corruption problem has absolutely nothing to do with reality , but rather with the fact that a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light , " said uwe dolata , press spokesman for the trade union representing germany 's criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- . the berlin-based arm of transparency international , a corruption watchdog , defines corruption as " the misuse of public or private economic power for private use . "
according to economists , corruption in germany results in lower tax revenues and higher state spending , amounting to losses of some € 200 billion -lrb- $ 259 billion -rrb- yearly . half-hearted laws ? in the face of such figures , the pressure is on to find effective ways to tackle the issue .
according to corruption experts , germany is n't doing enough to address the problem and needs to amend its body of law on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for instance , the rules on bribing members of the german or state parliament are so narrowly formulated that not a single case has been punished so far , " said dolata of the bdk . the law , which dates from 1994 , penalizes the " buying of votes " but only for voting rounds held in the german parliament or bundestag .
" you need to expand that law and also make corruption in other panels where preliminary political decisions are taken punishable , " said dagmar schröder , head of the german chapter of transparency international . experts cite germany 's 1999 international bribery law that forbids german companies from bribing members of parliament abroad as another example of regulations that do n't go far enough . " that means that if a german businessman greases the palms of a member of parliament abroad , he can be punished , " said dolata .
" but if he offers the same money to a german member of parliament , he ca n't be penalized . " taking pointers from scandinavia ? experts say that germany could pick up a few lessons in fighting corruption from scandinavian countries , who lead the way when it comes to battling fraud .
according to transparency international 's corruption index , finland is the least corrupt nation worldwide .
such a high ranking is linked to scandinavia 's dominating " culture of transparency , " said dagmar schröder and urged introducing a " glass member of parliament " concept for germany too , which would require politicians to publicly declare all their income . # b # a further area where germany has its work cut out is in the economic sector , which schröder said " is significantly more corrupt , in particular because the financial sums involved are so high . " transparency international is thus urging a corporate criminal law modeled on the one practiced in switzerland , whereby companies are held accountable for corruption cases .
in addition , the watchdog wants corrupt companies to be barred from receiving public contracts . angela göpfert -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced german referee arrested disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer , who has admitted accepting bribes to manipulate matches , was arrested by police on saturday amid fears that he would try to flee the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2005 fear in the schoolyard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just simple teasing schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .
teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . helge dietrich says that his students ' favorite expression is " son of a bitch . " a teacher at a high school in berlin 's mitte district and state chairman of the trade union for teachers -lrb- vde -rrb- , dietrich has been observing an increase in rowdy behavior at schools in berlin .
" it does n't take very long for verbal abuse to then turn into fisticuffs , " dietrich said . dietrich 's experience illustrates what his organization and the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- were trying to draw attention to at a meeting in berlin on monday : that violence in german schools is on the rise . schools helpless various studies support the claim .
statistics from berlin 's education department show that almost 19 percent of the 560 cases of school violence registered in 2003 - 04 took place on the way to school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , an investigation by the federal criminal office found that 5 percent of all students regularly engaged in violence ; a third occasionally indulged in fights .
a separate study by the weisser ring , an association for crime victims , found that every third student was too scared to cross the schoolyard during recess or even step on to the road leading to the school .
every second girl said she was frightened on the way to school and back home . " the quality of violence has increased and in a negative way , " said ludwig eckinger , vde national head .
" that means students are ready to hit more quickly even when their so-called victim is already injured .
we 're observing this aggressive behavior in all kinds of school and all over the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aggressive behavior at school can take many forms - from bullying a fellow student , abusing him , jostling him , stealing his jacket or sneakers to actual physical injury .
most teachers and schools are said to be overwhelmed by the dimensions of the problem . closer links between schools and police to counter the growing menace , the vde and the dpolg unveiled a new initiative in berlin on monday which foresees an intensified cooperation between schools and the police . wolfgang speck , chairman of the dpolg pointed out that school teachers and police in germany have already been working together for decades when it comes to teaching traffic sense and regulations to students or providing them information on the dangers of drug abuse .
the two can now work together along the same lines when it comes to containing violence at schools , speck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed police enter the gutenberg school in erfurt on april 26 , 2002 after a student ran amok and killed 18 people .
in future , uniformed officers are expected to be a regular feature in school corridors .
police officials will also conduct preventive classes in dealing with violence , which is already the case in some german states , including berlin . the new initiative also foresees every school having their own contact person in the next police station and vice versa .
they are expected to exchange information on potentially violent students .
" that means that when a violent incident takes place at a school the designated police officer arrives there as soon as possible .
that gives the message : when something untoward happens the police are there , " said speck . the close contact between schools and the cops is also meant to build trust , in particular among young foreign students who often have bad experiences with the police in their countries of origin . hurdles to overcome the concept already seems to be working in some places , such as the school in berlin where helge dietrich teaches .
" the police who come to our school , go into the classrooms and make it clear to the students what violence actually is , " said dietrich .
" they also familiarize the students with how they can deescalate violence . " despite the optimism surrounding the new initiative , cooperation between the police and schools is not expected to be all smooth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to the fact that many states are unable to fund such projects in the face of dwindling coffers , the police 's demand that all offenses at school be reported to them are also said to be unpopular among school directors worried that it might damage the reputation of their institutions . " actually every school director should be happy about such offers -lrb- of cooperation with the police -rrb- and one must be ready to learn that what is a deficit is n't necessarily a statement on how bad a school is , " said eckinger .
" instead , the director should say , ' we want to solve the problem ' . " that 's also a reason why the police suspect that the actual cases of violence at schools may be much higher than the statistics show , given that many simply go unreported . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de school violence trial begins in germany a whole german school class accused of torturing a fellow-student goes on trial tuesday .

experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed .

teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . helge dietrich says that his students ' favorite expression is " son of a bitch . " a teacher at a high school in berlin 's mitte district and state chairman of the trade union for teachers -lrb- vde -rrb- , dietrich has been observing an increase in rowdy behavior at schools in berlin .
" it does n't take very long for verbal abuse to then turn into fisticuffs , " dietrich said . dietrich 's experience illustrates what his organization and the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- were trying to draw attention to at a meeting in berlin on monday : that violence in german schools is on the rise . schools helpless various studies support the claim .
statistics from berlin 's education department show that almost 19 percent of the 560 cases of school violence registered in 2003 - 04 took place on the way to school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , an investigation by the federal criminal office found that 5 percent of all students regularly engaged in violence ; a third occasionally indulged in fights .
a separate study by the weisser ring , an association for crime victims , found that every third student was too scared to cross the schoolyard during recess or even step on to the road leading to the school .
every second girl said she was frightened on the way to school and back home . " the quality of violence has increased and in a negative way , " said ludwig eckinger , vde national head .
" that means students are ready to hit more quickly even when their so-called victim is already injured .
we 're observing this aggressive behavior in all kinds of school and all over the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aggressive behavior at school can take many forms - from bullying a fellow student , abusing him , jostling him , stealing his jacket or sneakers to actual physical injury .
most teachers and schools are said to be overwhelmed by the dimensions of the problem . closer links between schools and police to counter the growing menace , the vde and the dpolg unveiled a new initiative in berlin on monday which foresees an intensified cooperation between schools and the police . wolfgang speck , chairman of the dpolg pointed out that school teachers and police in germany have already been working together for decades when it comes to teaching traffic sense and regulations to students or providing them information on the dangers of drug abuse .
the two can now work together along the same lines when it comes to containing violence at schools , speck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed police enter the gutenberg school in erfurt on april 26 , 2002 after a student ran amok and killed 18 people .
in future , uniformed officers are expected to be a regular feature in school corridors .
police officials will also conduct preventive classes in dealing with violence , which is already the case in some german states , including berlin . the new initiative also foresees every school having their own contact person in the next police station and vice versa .
they are expected to exchange information on potentially violent students .
" that means that when a violent incident takes place at a school the designated police officer arrives there as soon as possible .
that gives the message : when something untoward happens the police are there , " said speck . the close contact between schools and the cops is also meant to build trust , in particular among young foreign students who often have bad experiences with the police in their countries of origin . hurdles to overcome the concept already seems to be working in some places , such as the school in berlin where helge dietrich teaches .
" the police who come to our school , go into the classrooms and make it clear to the students what violence actually is , " said dietrich .
" they also familiarize the students with how they can deescalate violence . " despite the optimism surrounding the new initiative , cooperation between the police and schools is not expected to be all smooth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to the fact that many states are unable to fund such projects in the face of dwindling coffers , the police 's demand that all offenses at school be reported to them are also said to be unpopular among school directors worried that it might damage the reputation of their institutions . " actually every school director should be happy about such offers -lrb- of cooperation with the police -rrb- and one must be ready to learn that what is a deficit is n't necessarily a statement on how bad a school is , " said eckinger .
" instead , the director should say , ' we want to solve the problem ' . " that 's also a reason why the police suspect that the actual cases of violence at schools may be much higher than the statistics show , given that many simply go unreported . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de school violence trial begins in germany a whole german school class accused of torturing a fellow-student goes on trial tuesday .
the students , aged 16 to 18 , are accused of torturing a classmate over months and filming themselves doing so .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2005 fear in the schoolyard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just simple teasing schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .
teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . helge dietrich says that his students ' favorite expression is " son of a bitch . " a teacher at a high school in berlin 's mitte district and state chairman of the trade union for teachers -lrb- vde -rrb- , dietrich has been observing an increase in rowdy behavior at schools in berlin .
" it does n't take very long for verbal abuse to then turn into fisticuffs , " dietrich said . dietrich 's experience illustrates what his organization and the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- were trying to draw attention to at a meeting in berlin on monday : that violence in german schools is on the rise . schools helpless various studies support the claim .
statistics from berlin 's education department show that almost 19 percent of the 560 cases of school violence registered in 2003 - 04 took place on the way to school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , an investigation by the federal criminal office found that 5 percent of all students regularly engaged in violence ; a third occasionally indulged in fights .
a separate study by the weisser ring , an association for crime victims , found that every third student was too scared to cross the schoolyard during recess or even step on to the road leading to the school .
every second girl said she was frightened on the way to school and back home . " the quality of violence has increased and in a negative way , " said ludwig eckinger , vde national head .
" that means students are ready to hit more quickly even when their so-called victim is already injured .
we 're observing this aggressive behavior in all kinds of school and all over the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aggressive behavior at school can take many forms - from bullying a fellow student , abusing him , jostling him , stealing his jacket or sneakers to actual physical injury .
most teachers and schools are said to be overwhelmed by the dimensions of the problem . closer links between schools and police to counter the growing menace , the vde and the dpolg unveiled a new initiative in berlin on monday which foresees an intensified cooperation between schools and the police . wolfgang speck , chairman of the dpolg pointed out that school teachers and police in germany have already been working together for decades when it comes to teaching traffic sense and regulations to students or providing them information on the dangers of drug abuse .
the two can now work together along the same lines when it comes to containing violence at schools , speck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed police enter the gutenberg school in erfurt on april 26 , 2002 after a student ran amok and killed 18 people .
in future , uniformed officers are expected to be a regular feature in school corridors .
police officials will also conduct preventive classes in dealing with violence , which is already the case in some german states , including berlin . the new initiative also foresees every school having their own contact person in the next police station and vice versa .
they are expected to exchange information on potentially violent students .
" that means that when a violent incident takes place at a school the designated police officer arrives there as soon as possible .
that gives the message : when something untoward happens the police are there , " said speck . the close contact between schools and the cops is also meant to build trust , in particular among young foreign students who often have bad experiences with the police in their countries of origin . hurdles to overcome the concept already seems to be working in some places , such as the school in berlin where helge dietrich teaches .
" the police who come to our school , go into the classrooms and make it clear to the students what violence actually is , " said dietrich .
" they also familiarize the students with how they can deescalate violence . " despite the optimism surrounding the new initiative , cooperation between the police and schools is not expected to be all smooth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to the fact that many states are unable to fund such projects in the face of dwindling coffers , the police 's demand that all offenses at school be reported to them are also said to be unpopular among school directors worried that it might damage the reputation of their institutions . " actually every school director should be happy about such offers -lrb- of cooperation with the police -rrb- and one must be ready to learn that what is a deficit is n't necessarily a statement on how bad a school is , " said eckinger .
" instead , the director should say , ' we want to solve the problem ' . " that 's also a reason why the police suspect that the actual cases of violence at schools may be much higher than the statistics show , given that many simply go unreported . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de school violence trial begins in germany a whole german school class accused of torturing a fellow-student goes on trial tuesday .

experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .
" the perception that germany has no corruption problem has absolutely nothing to do with reality , but rather with the fact that a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light , " said uwe dolata , press spokesman for the trade union representing germany 's criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- . the berlin-based arm of transparency international , a corruption watchdog , defines corruption as " the misuse of public or private economic power for private use . "
according to economists , corruption in germany results in lower tax revenues and higher state spending , amounting to losses of some € 200 billion -lrb- $ 259 billion -rrb- yearly . half-hearted laws ? in the face of such figures , the pressure is on to find effective ways to tackle the issue .
according to corruption experts , germany is n't doing enough to address the problem and needs to amend its body of law on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for instance , the rules on bribing members of the german or state parliament are so narrowly formulated that not a single case has been punished so far , " said dolata of the bdk . the law , which dates from 1994 , penalizes the " buying of votes " but only for voting rounds held in the german parliament or bundestag .
" you need to expand that law and also make corruption in other panels where preliminary political decisions are taken punishable , " said dagmar schröder , head of the german chapter of transparency international . experts cite germany 's 1999 international bribery law that forbids german companies from bribing members of parliament abroad as another example of regulations that do n't go far enough . " that means that if a german businessman greases the palms of a member of parliament abroad , he can be punished , " said dolata .
" but if he offers the same money to a german member of parliament , he ca n't be penalized . " taking pointers from scandinavia ? experts say that germany could pick up a few lessons in fighting corruption from scandinavian countries , who lead the way when it comes to battling fraud .
according to transparency international 's corruption index , finland is the least corrupt nation worldwide .
such a high ranking is linked to scandinavia 's dominating " culture of transparency , " said dagmar schröder and urged introducing a " glass member of parliament " concept for germany too , which would require politicians to publicly declare all their income . # b # a further area where germany has its work cut out is in the economic sector , which schröder said " is significantly more corrupt , in particular because the financial sums involved are so high . " transparency international is thus urging a corporate criminal law modeled on the one practiced in switzerland , whereby companies are held accountable for corruption cases .
in addition , the watchdog wants corrupt companies to be barred from receiving public contracts . angela göpfert -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced german referee arrested disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer , who has admitted accepting bribes to manipulate matches , was arrested by police on saturday amid fears that he would try to flee the country .

though it is expected to pass in spain , observers say it 's anything but a sure thing elsewhere . on april 15th , a copy of the european union constitution will hitch a ride with a russian rocket into space .
brussels apparently wants the extraterrestrial stunt to prove to the world that around half a billion europeans from 25 countries are all unitedly striving for " peace , freedom and prosperity . "
but , many europeans might wish the document just stayed there . discontent and general confusion regarding the document that aims to streamline bureaucracy in the 25-member bloc and chart the course europe will take in the future have made the constitution a difficult sell for european union leaders .
last week , french president jacques chirac and spanish prime minister josé luis rodríguez zapatero urged a gathering of about 2,000 spaniards to give the new document a chance . first of 10 the constitution “ has anchored freedom and democracy on the continent , ” said zapatero .
“ it will mean that war and dictatorship will disappear forever from europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution was put together by 150 delegates on feb .
20 , spain will be the first of 10 of the eu 's 25 member countries to put the constitution up to a referendum .
the populations of denmark , poland , the netherlands , portugal , ireland , luxembourg , the czech republic and , perhaps most importantly , france and great britain will follow in 2005 and 2006 .
opinion polls indicate that spain will approve the constitution .
but whether the other countries will follow is anyone ’ s guess . " it 's a national-driven process , which makes it quite challenging and unpredictable , " said sebastian kurpas , a constitution expert at the center for european policy studies in brussels . the document is the product of more than 16 months of work by a group of european parliamentarians , advisors and 150 other delegates , and was completed in july 2003 and blessed by eu leaders last november .
it establishes a permanent president of the european council , a body comprised of eu leaders , and combines what were two foreign representatives into one . what 's it all about ? the far left has rejected it as a global capitalist charter without adequate social protections , while the far right and nationalists have attacked it as a blueprint for a european " superstate " that would give too much power to brussels . the average european citizen , however , seems to have little idea what it 's all about .
a recent poll by the eu organization eurobarometer revealed that 33 percent of the eu citizens polled had never heard of the charter . " it 's a confusing and sometimes a contradictory document , " said kurpas .
" you are always in danger of getting stuck in details and missing the grand picture . " a european litmus test with euroskepticism on the rise , each national referendum will give brussels a good idea of how it stands with the voting country , and observers are worried domestic politicians will hijack the referendum for their own purposes .
in france , for example , social policy is likely to dominate the referendum .
in great britain , it 's likely to be immigration and asylum politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution is expected to face stiff opposition in britain .
these british european parliamentarians give a taste what 's to come . " even irrelevant issues can be become divisive in a referendum debate , " writes daniel keohane in a briefing paper published by the center for european reform in london .
" defense policy was paramount to the irish debate on the nice treaty in 2001 , even though the defense provision in that treaty did not affect ireland 's cherished policy of neutrality . " what does a " no " mean ? should one or more countries vote no on the constitution , one of three things can happen .
depending on the size and stature of the country in the union , the government will either put the constitution back to vote at a later date , send the document back to the drawing board or agree to back out of the constitution and re-negotiate its eu membership .
the latter is unlikely if , say , france were to say no . government leaders are working hard to keep something like that from happening by emphasizing the progress membership has brought to their countries . " in a country like spain , government is making a link to the big economic benefits that have come through europe that have modernized spain , " said kurpas .
the strategy gives people " a vision that europe is a benefit . " referenda as a democratic tool over the past two months , the spanish government spent € 7.5 million on an education campaign including spanish celebrities that seems to have had some effect .
a little over 51 percent of the population is in favor of a constitution , 10 percent more than before the campaign got underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spains prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero speaks at the opening of the european constitution campaign in madrid thursday night feb .

one thing the referendums do is give european citizens an unusual amount of direct involvement in a major eu decision .
observers think more referendums might be a good way to increase awareness and involvement by europeans in the eu in the future .
" following so many referenda on the constitutional treaty , it will be difficult for governments not to put other kinds of eu issues to a public vote , " argued keohane .

experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .

experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .

in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .

in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .
while under existing law it is possible to ban gatherings that “ represent a danger for public security and order , ” the new measures could - at least in theory - permit a ban when there is “ no threat of a criminal violation of public security . ” restrictions on more than just far-right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will anti-war demonstrators come under the same restrictions as neo-nazis ?
in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

" germany is fundamentally ready to participate on this basis , " the spokesman , thomas steg , said at a routine government media conference . un secretary general kofi annan has urged the security council to " assume its responsibility " for peace and security in sudan 's troubled darfur region , and at the weekend appealed to the european union and nato to become involved .
annan has asked for a peacekeeping operation , involving more than 10,000 personnel , to be launched . ethnic rebels rose up in darfur , a vast western area the size of france , in february 2003 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2005 the german problem with corruption großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament dome is transparent , but that 's about it a widening match-fixing scandal and revelation of politicians ' corporate salaries have sullied germany 's once clean image .
experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .
" the perception that germany has no corruption problem has absolutely nothing to do with reality , but rather with the fact that a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light , " said uwe dolata , press spokesman for the trade union representing germany 's criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- . the berlin-based arm of transparency international , a corruption watchdog , defines corruption as " the misuse of public or private economic power for private use . "
according to economists , corruption in germany results in lower tax revenues and higher state spending , amounting to losses of some € 200 billion -lrb- $ 259 billion -rrb- yearly . half-hearted laws ? in the face of such figures , the pressure is on to find effective ways to tackle the issue .
according to corruption experts , germany is n't doing enough to address the problem and needs to amend its body of law on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for instance , the rules on bribing members of the german or state parliament are so narrowly formulated that not a single case has been punished so far , " said dolata of the bdk . the law , which dates from 1994 , penalizes the " buying of votes " but only for voting rounds held in the german parliament or bundestag .
" you need to expand that law and also make corruption in other panels where preliminary political decisions are taken punishable , " said dagmar schröder , head of the german chapter of transparency international . experts cite germany 's 1999 international bribery law that forbids german companies from bribing members of parliament abroad as another example of regulations that do n't go far enough . " that means that if a german businessman greases the palms of a member of parliament abroad , he can be punished , " said dolata .
" but if he offers the same money to a german member of parliament , he ca n't be penalized . " taking pointers from scandinavia ? experts say that germany could pick up a few lessons in fighting corruption from scandinavian countries , who lead the way when it comes to battling fraud .
according to transparency international 's corruption index , finland is the least corrupt nation worldwide .
such a high ranking is linked to scandinavia 's dominating " culture of transparency , " said dagmar schröder and urged introducing a " glass member of parliament " concept for germany too , which would require politicians to publicly declare all their income . # b # a further area where germany has its work cut out is in the economic sector , which schröder said " is significantly more corrupt , in particular because the financial sums involved are so high . " transparency international is thus urging a corporate criminal law modeled on the one practiced in switzerland , whereby companies are held accountable for corruption cases .
in addition , the watchdog wants corrupt companies to be barred from receiving public contracts . angela göpfert -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced german referee arrested disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer , who has admitted accepting bribes to manipulate matches , was arrested by police on saturday amid fears that he would try to flee the country .

experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .
" the perception that germany has no corruption problem has absolutely nothing to do with reality , but rather with the fact that a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light , " said uwe dolata , press spokesman for the trade union representing germany 's criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- . the berlin-based arm of transparency international , a corruption watchdog , defines corruption as " the misuse of public or private economic power for private use .

" you need to expand that law and also make corruption in other panels where preliminary political decisions are taken punishable , " said dagmar schröder , head of the german chapter of transparency international . experts cite germany 's 1999 international bribery law that forbids german companies from bribing members of parliament abroad as another example of regulations that do n't go far enough . " that means that if a german businessman greases the palms of a member of parliament abroad , he can be punished , " said dolata .
" but if he offers the same money to a german member of parliament , he ca n't be penalized . " taking pointers from scandinavia ? experts say that germany could pick up a few lessons in fighting corruption from scandinavian countries , who lead the way when it comes to battling fraud .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.02.2005 germany debates the right of assembly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposals would ban npd rallies but would they infringe civil rights ?
in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .
while under existing law it is possible to ban gatherings that “ represent a danger for public security and order , ” the new measures could - at least in theory - permit a ban when there is “ no threat of a criminal violation of public security . ” restrictions on more than just far-right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will anti-war demonstrators come under the same restrictions as neo-nazis ?
in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the rocky road to an eu constitution all eu hopes on spain a referendum for germany after all ? eu parliament approves constitution ratifying eu constitution will be a ' tough battle ' europe -pipe- 15.02.2005 putting the constitution to the test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referenda give european citizens an unusual amount of influence this friday in spain , the eu constitution faces the first of ten national referendums .
though it is expected to pass in spain , observers say it 's anything but a sure thing elsewhere . on april 15th , a copy of the european union constitution will hitch a ride with a russian rocket into space .
brussels apparently wants the extraterrestrial stunt to prove to the world that around half a billion europeans from 25 countries are all unitedly striving for " peace , freedom and prosperity . "
but , many europeans might wish the document just stayed there . discontent and general confusion regarding the document that aims to streamline bureaucracy in the 25-member bloc and chart the course europe will take in the future have made the constitution a difficult sell for european union leaders .
last week , french president jacques chirac and spanish prime minister josé luis rodríguez zapatero urged a gathering of about 2,000 spaniards to give the new document a chance . first of 10 the constitution “ has anchored freedom and democracy on the continent , ” said zapatero .
“ it will mean that war and dictatorship will disappear forever from europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution was put together by 150 delegates on feb .
20 , spain will be the first of 10 of the eu 's 25 member countries to put the constitution up to a referendum .
the populations of denmark , poland , the netherlands , portugal , ireland , luxembourg , the czech republic and , perhaps most importantly , france and great britain will follow in 2005 and 2006 .
opinion polls indicate that spain will approve the constitution .
but whether the other countries will follow is anyone ’ s guess . " it 's a national-driven process , which makes it quite challenging and unpredictable , " said sebastian kurpas , a constitution expert at the center for european policy studies in brussels . the document is the product of more than 16 months of work by a group of european parliamentarians , advisors and 150 other delegates , and was completed in july 2003 and blessed by eu leaders last november .
it establishes a permanent president of the european council , a body comprised of eu leaders , and combines what were two foreign representatives into one . what 's it all about ? the far left has rejected it as a global capitalist charter without adequate social protections , while the far right and nationalists have attacked it as a blueprint for a european " superstate " that would give too much power to brussels . the average european citizen , however , seems to have little idea what it 's all about .
a recent poll by the eu organization eurobarometer revealed that 33 percent of the eu citizens polled had never heard of the charter . " it 's a confusing and sometimes a contradictory document , " said kurpas .
" you are always in danger of getting stuck in details and missing the grand picture . " a european litmus test with euroskepticism on the rise , each national referendum will give brussels a good idea of how it stands with the voting country , and observers are worried domestic politicians will hijack the referendum for their own purposes .
in france , for example , social policy is likely to dominate the referendum .
in great britain , it 's likely to be immigration and asylum politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution is expected to face stiff opposition in britain .
these british european parliamentarians give a taste what 's to come . " even irrelevant issues can be become divisive in a referendum debate , " writes daniel keohane in a briefing paper published by the center for european reform in london .
" defense policy was paramount to the irish debate on the nice treaty in 2001 , even though the defense provision in that treaty did not affect ireland 's cherished policy of neutrality . " what does a " no " mean ? should one or more countries vote no on the constitution , one of three things can happen .
depending on the size and stature of the country in the union , the government will either put the constitution back to vote at a later date , send the document back to the drawing board or agree to back out of the constitution and re-negotiate its eu membership .
the latter is unlikely if , say , france were to say no . government leaders are working hard to keep something like that from happening by emphasizing the progress membership has brought to their countries . " in a country like spain , government is making a link to the big economic benefits that have come through europe that have modernized spain , " said kurpas .
the strategy gives people " a vision that europe is a benefit . " referenda as a democratic tool over the past two months , the spanish government spent € 7.5 million on an education campaign including spanish celebrities that seems to have had some effect .
a little over 51 percent of the population is in favor of a constitution , 10 percent more than before the campaign got underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spains prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero speaks at the opening of the european constitution campaign in madrid thursday night feb .

one thing the referendums do is give european citizens an unusual amount of direct involvement in a major eu decision .
observers think more referendums might be a good way to increase awareness and involvement by europeans in the eu in the future .
" following so many referenda on the constitutional treaty , it will be difficult for governments not to put other kinds of eu issues to a public vote , " argued keohane .
he added that " in the future , it will be harder for critics to claim that the eu is inherently undemocratic .

in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .
while under existing law it is possible to ban gatherings that “ represent a danger for public security and order , ” the new measures could - at least in theory - permit a ban when there is “ no threat of a criminal violation of public security . ” restrictions on more than just far-right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will anti-war demonstrators come under the same restrictions as neo-nazis ?
in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .

experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .
" the perception that germany has no corruption problem has absolutely nothing to do with reality , but rather with the fact that a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light , " said uwe dolata , press spokesman for the trade union representing germany 's criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- . the berlin-based arm of transparency international , a corruption watchdog , defines corruption as " the misuse of public or private economic power for private use . "
according to economists , corruption in germany results in lower tax revenues and higher state spending , amounting to losses of some € 200 billion -lrb- $ 259 billion -rrb- yearly . half-hearted laws ? in the face of such figures , the pressure is on to find effective ways to tackle the issue .
according to corruption experts , germany is n't doing enough to address the problem and needs to amend its body of law on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for instance , the rules on bribing members of the german or state parliament are so narrowly formulated that not a single case has been punished so far , " said dolata of the bdk . the law , which dates from 1994 , penalizes the " buying of votes " but only for voting rounds held in the german parliament or bundestag .
" you need to expand that law and also make corruption in other panels where preliminary political decisions are taken punishable , " said dagmar schröder , head of the german chapter of transparency international . experts cite germany 's 1999 international bribery law that forbids german companies from bribing members of parliament abroad as another example of regulations that do n't go far enough . " that means that if a german businessman greases the palms of a member of parliament abroad , he can be punished , " said dolata .
" but if he offers the same money to a german member of parliament , he ca n't be penalized . " taking pointers from scandinavia ? experts say that germany could pick up a few lessons in fighting corruption from scandinavian countries , who lead the way when it comes to battling fraud .
according to transparency international 's corruption index , finland is the least corrupt nation worldwide .
such a high ranking is linked to scandinavia 's dominating " culture of transparency , " said dagmar schröder and urged introducing a " glass member of parliament " concept for germany too , which would require politicians to publicly declare all their income . # b # a further area where germany has its work cut out is in the economic sector , which schröder said " is significantly more corrupt , in particular because the financial sums involved are so high . " transparency international is thus urging a corporate criminal law modeled on the one practiced in switzerland , whereby companies are held accountable for corruption cases .
in addition , the watchdog wants corrupt companies to be barred from receiving public contracts . angela göpfert -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced german referee arrested disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer , who has admitted accepting bribes to manipulate matches , was arrested by police on saturday amid fears that he would try to flee the country .

in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .
while under existing law it is possible to ban gatherings that “ represent a danger for public security and order , ” the new measures could - at least in theory - permit a ban when there is “ no threat of a criminal violation of public security . ” restrictions on more than just far-right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will anti-war demonstrators come under the same restrictions as neo-nazis ?
in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the rocky road to an eu constitution all eu hopes on spain a referendum for germany after all ? eu parliament approves constitution ratifying eu constitution will be a ' tough battle ' europe -pipe- 15.02.2005 putting the constitution to the test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referenda give european citizens an unusual amount of influence this friday in spain , the eu constitution faces the first of ten national referendums .
though it is expected to pass in spain , observers say it 's anything but a sure thing elsewhere . on april 15th , a copy of the european union constitution will hitch a ride with a russian rocket into space .
brussels apparently wants the extraterrestrial stunt to prove to the world that around half a billion europeans from 25 countries are all unitedly striving for " peace , freedom and prosperity . "
but , many europeans might wish the document just stayed there . discontent and general confusion regarding the document that aims to streamline bureaucracy in the 25-member bloc and chart the course europe will take in the future have made the constitution a difficult sell for european union leaders .
last week , french president jacques chirac and spanish prime minister josé luis rodríguez zapatero urged a gathering of about 2,000 spaniards to give the new document a chance . first of 10 the constitution “ has anchored freedom and democracy on the continent , ” said zapatero .
“ it will mean that war and dictatorship will disappear forever from europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution was put together by 150 delegates on feb .
20 , spain will be the first of 10 of the eu 's 25 member countries to put the constitution up to a referendum .
the populations of denmark , poland , the netherlands , portugal , ireland , luxembourg , the czech republic and , perhaps most importantly , france and great britain will follow in 2005 and 2006 .
opinion polls indicate that spain will approve the constitution .
but whether the other countries will follow is anyone ’ s guess . " it 's a national-driven process , which makes it quite challenging and unpredictable , " said sebastian kurpas , a constitution expert at the center for european policy studies in brussels . the document is the product of more than 16 months of work by a group of european parliamentarians , advisors and 150 other delegates , and was completed in july 2003 and blessed by eu leaders last november .
it establishes a permanent president of the european council , a body comprised of eu leaders , and combines what were two foreign representatives into one . what 's it all about ? the far left has rejected it as a global capitalist charter without adequate social protections , while the far right and nationalists have attacked it as a blueprint for a european " superstate " that would give too much power to brussels . the average european citizen , however , seems to have little idea what it 's all about .
a recent poll by the eu organization eurobarometer revealed that 33 percent of the eu citizens polled had never heard of the charter . " it 's a confusing and sometimes a contradictory document , " said kurpas .
" you are always in danger of getting stuck in details and missing the grand picture . " a european litmus test with euroskepticism on the rise , each national referendum will give brussels a good idea of how it stands with the voting country , and observers are worried domestic politicians will hijack the referendum for their own purposes .
in france , for example , social policy is likely to dominate the referendum .
in great britain , it 's likely to be immigration and asylum politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution is expected to face stiff opposition in britain .
these british european parliamentarians give a taste what 's to come . " even irrelevant issues can be become divisive in a referendum debate , " writes daniel keohane in a briefing paper published by the center for european reform in london .
" defense policy was paramount to the irish debate on the nice treaty in 2001 , even though the defense provision in that treaty did not affect ireland 's cherished policy of neutrality . " what does a " no " mean ? should one or more countries vote no on the constitution , one of three things can happen .

teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . helge dietrich says that his students ' favorite expression is " son of a bitch . " a teacher at a high school in berlin 's mitte district and state chairman of the trade union for teachers -lrb- vde -rrb- , dietrich has been observing an increase in rowdy behavior at schools in berlin .
" it does n't take very long for verbal abuse to then turn into fisticuffs , " dietrich said . dietrich 's experience illustrates what his organization and the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- were trying to draw attention to at a meeting in berlin on monday : that violence in german schools is on the rise . schools helpless various studies support the claim .
statistics from berlin 's education department show that almost 19 percent of the 560 cases of school violence registered in 2003 - 04 took place on the way to school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , an investigation by the federal criminal office found that 5 percent of all students regularly engaged in violence ; a third occasionally indulged in fights .
a separate study by the weisser ring , an association for crime victims , found that every third student was too scared to cross the schoolyard during recess or even step on to the road leading to the school .
every second girl said she was frightened on the way to school and back home . " the quality of violence has increased and in a negative way , " said ludwig eckinger , vde national head .
" that means students are ready to hit more quickly even when their so-called victim is already injured .
we 're observing this aggressive behavior in all kinds of school and all over the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aggressive behavior at school can take many forms - from bullying a fellow student , abusing him , jostling him , stealing his jacket or sneakers to actual physical injury .
most teachers and schools are said to be overwhelmed by the dimensions of the problem . closer links between schools and police to counter the growing menace , the vde and the dpolg unveiled a new initiative in berlin on monday which foresees an intensified cooperation between schools and the police . wolfgang speck , chairman of the dpolg pointed out that school teachers and police in germany have already been working together for decades when it comes to teaching traffic sense and regulations to students or providing them information on the dangers of drug abuse .
the two can now work together along the same lines when it comes to containing violence at schools , speck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed police enter the gutenberg school in erfurt on april 26 , 2002 after a student ran amok and killed 18 people .
in future , uniformed officers are expected to be a regular feature in school corridors .
police officials will also conduct preventive classes in dealing with violence , which is already the case in some german states , including berlin . the new initiative also foresees every school having their own contact person in the next police station and vice versa .
they are expected to exchange information on potentially violent students .
" that means that when a violent incident takes place at a school the designated police officer arrives there as soon as possible .
that gives the message : when something untoward happens the police are there , " said speck . the close contact between schools and the cops is also meant to build trust , in particular among young foreign students who often have bad experiences with the police in their countries of origin . hurdles to overcome the concept already seems to be working in some places , such as the school in berlin where helge dietrich teaches .
" the police who come to our school , go into the classrooms and make it clear to the students what violence actually is , " said dietrich .
" they also familiarize the students with how they can deescalate violence . " despite the optimism surrounding the new initiative , cooperation between the police and schools is not expected to be all smooth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to the fact that many states are unable to fund such projects in the face of dwindling coffers , the police 's demand that all offenses at school be reported to them are also said to be unpopular among school directors worried that it might damage the reputation of their institutions . " actually every school director should be happy about such offers -lrb- of cooperation with the police -rrb- and one must be ready to learn that what is a deficit is n't necessarily a statement on how bad a school is , " said eckinger .
" instead , the director should say , ' we want to solve the problem ' . " that 's also a reason why the police suspect that the actual cases of violence at schools may be much higher than the statistics show , given that many simply go unreported . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de school violence trial begins in germany a whole german school class accused of torturing a fellow-student goes on trial tuesday .

only four managed to meet the internationally agreed aid quota . in a report that names and shames some of the european union 's richest states , a number of non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- have accused the likes of germany and italy of keeping their purse strings tightened when it comes to helping the world 's poorest countries the report released on monday by action aid , eurodad and oxfam accuses europe 's misers in the wake of the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- meeting during which the world 's wealthiest nations pledged to rid the world 's poorest countries of their crippling debt but failed to meet africa 's demand for immediate action . the european relief agencies published a damning critique of member states ' efforts to address the issue , saying that g7 countries such as germany and italy did too little to meet a united nations target to reduce poverty in the world by 2015 . eu majority are " way off track " the combined data showed that only four eu states had fulfilled a promise made in 1970 by the world 's rich countries to give 0.7 percent of their gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- as foreign aid .
" the other 21 eu states are still a long way off track in terms of their promise ... this is inexcusable , " the report stated . those eu states that avoided the report 's scorn included luxembourg , which gives 0.8 percent of gni in aid , and sweden , which has also met the 0.7 percent target , saying these in particular deserved " gold stars " for their efforts .
the report also praised the netherlands for giving 0.81 percent , but said its gold star was at risk because the government wanted to count security-related expenditures as aid . even euro champ gets stingier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's " leading champion " was denmark , which currently pays the most of all eu states with 0.84 percent .
however , there were reservations in the report as to denmark 's future intentions as the danish government had been cutting down on aid spending since 2001 , when it gave 1.03 percent . " the eu must take positive action on three issues : improving the quantity and quality of international aid ; easing the burden of unsustainable debt ; and making the rules for world trade fairer , " the report stated . germany 's goal overly optimistic , says report singling out german chancellor gerhard schröder , the leader of the eu 's largest economy , for particular criticism , the report said that schröder 's promise at the world economic forum in davos that germany would reach the 0.7 percent goal in the " medium term " was optimistic at best .
" on current trends , germany will not reach the 0.7 percent until 2087 , which is a long way from being in the ' medium term ' , " the report said . italy also found itself in the firing line : " italy is one of the world 's wealthiest nations , yet it gives only a miserly 0.17 percent of its gni in aid . " g7 indecision compounds aid misery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministers of the group of seven major industrial countries .
despite the efforts of british finance minister gordon brown , who presented a plan for helping africa in what he called a " make or break year , " the g7 failed to agree on the proposals which would have freed up an extra € 38.4 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year for poor countries and completely write off their debts . an agreement was eventually reached on the subject of debt relief but the increase in cash remained contentious . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

though it is expected to pass in spain , observers say it 's anything but a sure thing elsewhere . on april 15th , a copy of the european union constitution will hitch a ride with a russian rocket into space .
brussels apparently wants the extraterrestrial stunt to prove to the world that around half a billion europeans from 25 countries are all unitedly striving for " peace , freedom and prosperity . "
but , many europeans might wish the document just stayed there . discontent and general confusion regarding the document that aims to streamline bureaucracy in the 25-member bloc and chart the course europe will take in the future have made the constitution a difficult sell for european union leaders .
last week , french president jacques chirac and spanish prime minister josé luis rodríguez zapatero urged a gathering of about 2,000 spaniards to give the new document a chance . first of 10 the constitution “ has anchored freedom and democracy on the continent , ” said zapatero .
“ it will mean that war and dictatorship will disappear forever from europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution was put together by 150 delegates on feb .
20 , spain will be the first of 10 of the eu 's 25 member countries to put the constitution up to a referendum .
the populations of denmark , poland , the netherlands , portugal , ireland , luxembourg , the czech republic and , perhaps most importantly , france and great britain will follow in 2005 and 2006 .
opinion polls indicate that spain will approve the constitution .
but whether the other countries will follow is anyone ’ s guess . " it 's a national-driven process , which makes it quite challenging and unpredictable , " said sebastian kurpas , a constitution expert at the center for european policy studies in brussels . the document is the product of more than 16 months of work by a group of european parliamentarians , advisors and 150 other delegates , and was completed in july 2003 and blessed by eu leaders last november .
it establishes a permanent president of the european council , a body comprised of eu leaders , and combines what were two foreign representatives into one . what 's it all about ? the far left has rejected it as a global capitalist charter without adequate social protections , while the far right and nationalists have attacked it as a blueprint for a european " superstate " that would give too much power to brussels . the average european citizen , however , seems to have little idea what it 's all about .
a recent poll by the eu organization eurobarometer revealed that 33 percent of the eu citizens polled had never heard of the charter . " it 's a confusing and sometimes a contradictory document , " said kurpas .
" you are always in danger of getting stuck in details and missing the grand picture . " a european litmus test with euroskepticism on the rise , each national referendum will give brussels a good idea of how it stands with the voting country , and observers are worried domestic politicians will hijack the referendum for their own purposes .
in france , for example , social policy is likely to dominate the referendum .
in great britain , it 's likely to be immigration and asylum politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution is expected to face stiff opposition in britain .
these british european parliamentarians give a taste what 's to come . " even irrelevant issues can be become divisive in a referendum debate , " writes daniel keohane in a briefing paper published by the center for european reform in london .
" defense policy was paramount to the irish debate on the nice treaty in 2001 , even though the defense provision in that treaty did not affect ireland 's cherished policy of neutrality . " what does a " no " mean ? should one or more countries vote no on the constitution , one of three things can happen .
depending on the size and stature of the country in the union , the government will either put the constitution back to vote at a later date , send the document back to the drawing board or agree to back out of the constitution and re-negotiate its eu membership .
the latter is unlikely if , say , france were to say no . government leaders are working hard to keep something like that from happening by emphasizing the progress membership has brought to their countries .

in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .
while under existing law it is possible to ban gatherings that “ represent a danger for public security and order , ” the new measures could - at least in theory - permit a ban when there is “ no threat of a criminal violation of public security . ” restrictions on more than just far-right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will anti-war demonstrators come under the same restrictions as neo-nazis ?
in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

though it is expected to pass in spain , observers say it 's anything but a sure thing elsewhere . on april 15th , a copy of the european union constitution will hitch a ride with a russian rocket into space .
brussels apparently wants the extraterrestrial stunt to prove to the world that around half a billion europeans from 25 countries are all unitedly striving for " peace , freedom and prosperity . "
but , many europeans might wish the document just stayed there . discontent and general confusion regarding the document that aims to streamline bureaucracy in the 25-member bloc and chart the course europe will take in the future have made the constitution a difficult sell for european union leaders .
last week , french president jacques chirac and spanish prime minister josé luis rodríguez zapatero urged a gathering of about 2,000 spaniards to give the new document a chance . first of 10 the constitution “ has anchored freedom and democracy on the continent , ” said zapatero .
“ it will mean that war and dictatorship will disappear forever from europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution was put together by 150 delegates on feb .
20 , spain will be the first of 10 of the eu 's 25 member countries to put the constitution up to a referendum .
the populations of denmark , poland , the netherlands , portugal , ireland , luxembourg , the czech republic and , perhaps most importantly , france and great britain will follow in 2005 and 2006 .
opinion polls indicate that spain will approve the constitution .
but whether the other countries will follow is anyone ’ s guess . " it 's a national-driven process , which makes it quite challenging and unpredictable , " said sebastian kurpas , a constitution expert at the center for european policy studies in brussels . the document is the product of more than 16 months of work by a group of european parliamentarians , advisors and 150 other delegates , and was completed in july 2003 and blessed by eu leaders last november .
it establishes a permanent president of the european council , a body comprised of eu leaders , and combines what were two foreign representatives into one . what 's it all about ? the far left has rejected it as a global capitalist charter without adequate social protections , while the far right and nationalists have attacked it as a blueprint for a european " superstate " that would give too much power to brussels . the average european citizen , however , seems to have little idea what it 's all about .
a recent poll by the eu organization eurobarometer revealed that 33 percent of the eu citizens polled had never heard of the charter . " it 's a confusing and sometimes a contradictory document , " said kurpas .
" you are always in danger of getting stuck in details and missing the grand picture . " a european litmus test with euroskepticism on the rise , each national referendum will give brussels a good idea of how it stands with the voting country , and observers are worried domestic politicians will hijack the referendum for their own purposes .
in france , for example , social policy is likely to dominate the referendum .
in great britain , it 's likely to be immigration and asylum politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution is expected to face stiff opposition in britain .
these british european parliamentarians give a taste what 's to come . " even irrelevant issues can be become divisive in a referendum debate , " writes daniel keohane in a briefing paper published by the center for european reform in london .
" defense policy was paramount to the irish debate on the nice treaty in 2001 , even though the defense provision in that treaty did not affect ireland 's cherished policy of neutrality . " what does a " no " mean ? should one or more countries vote no on the constitution , one of three things can happen .
depending on the size and stature of the country in the union , the government will either put the constitution back to vote at a later date , send the document back to the drawing board or agree to back out of the constitution and re-negotiate its eu membership .
the latter is unlikely if , say , france were to say no . government leaders are working hard to keep something like that from happening by emphasizing the progress membership has brought to their countries . " in a country like spain , government is making a link to the big economic benefits that have come through europe that have modernized spain , " said kurpas .
the strategy gives people " a vision that europe is a benefit . " referenda as a democratic tool over the past two months , the spanish government spent € 7.5 million on an education campaign including spanish celebrities that seems to have had some effect .
a little over 51 percent of the population is in favor of a constitution , 10 percent more than before the campaign got underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spains prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero speaks at the opening of the european constitution campaign in madrid thursday night feb .
3 , 2005 in front of people holding signs reaing si -lrb- yes -rrb- .
one thing the referendums do is give european citizens an unusual amount of direct involvement in a major eu decision .
observers think more referendums might be a good way to increase awareness and involvement by europeans in the eu in the future .
" following so many referenda on the constitutional treaty , it will be difficult for governments not to put other kinds of eu issues to a public vote , " argued keohane .
he added that " in the future , it will be harder for critics to claim that the eu is inherently undemocratic .

only four managed to meet the internationally agreed aid quota . in a report that names and shames some of the european union 's richest states , a number of non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- have accused the likes of germany and italy of keeping their purse strings tightened when it comes to helping the world 's poorest countries the report released on monday by action aid , eurodad and oxfam accuses europe 's misers in the wake of the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- meeting during which the world 's wealthiest nations pledged to rid the world 's poorest countries of their crippling debt but failed to meet africa 's demand for immediate action . the european relief agencies published a damning critique of member states ' efforts to address the issue , saying that g7 countries such as germany and italy did too little to meet a united nations target to reduce poverty in the world by 2015 . eu majority are " way off track " the combined data showed that only four eu states had fulfilled a promise made in 1970 by the world 's rich countries to give 0.7 percent of their gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- as foreign aid .
" the other 21 eu states are still a long way off track in terms of their promise ... this is inexcusable , " the report stated . those eu states that avoided the report 's scorn included luxembourg , which gives 0.8 percent of gni in aid , and sweden , which has also met the 0.7 percent target , saying these in particular deserved " gold stars " for their efforts .
the report also praised the netherlands for giving 0.81 percent , but said its gold star was at risk because the government wanted to count security-related expenditures as aid . even euro champ gets stingier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's " leading champion " was denmark , which currently pays the most of all eu states with 0.84 percent .
however , there were reservations in the report as to denmark 's future intentions as the danish government had been cutting down on aid spending since 2001 , when it gave 1.03 percent . " the eu must take positive action on three issues : improving the quantity and quality of international aid ; easing the burden of unsustainable debt ; and making the rules for world trade fairer , " the report stated . germany 's goal overly optimistic , says report singling out german chancellor gerhard schröder , the leader of the eu 's largest economy , for particular criticism , the report said that schröder 's promise at the world economic forum in davos that germany would reach the 0.7 percent goal in the " medium term " was optimistic at best .
" on current trends , germany will not reach the 0.7 percent until 2087 , which is a long way from being in the ' medium term ' , " the report said . italy also found itself in the firing line : " italy is one of the world 's wealthiest nations , yet it gives only a miserly 0.17 percent of its gni in aid . " g7 indecision compounds aid misery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministers of the group of seven major industrial countries .
despite the efforts of british finance minister gordon brown , who presented a plan for helping africa in what he called a " make or break year , " the g7 failed to agree on the proposals which would have freed up an extra € 38.4 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year for poor countries and completely write off their debts . an agreement was eventually reached on the subject of debt relief but the increase in cash remained contentious . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

annan has asked for a peacekeeping operation , involving more than 10,000 personnel , to be launched . ethnic rebels rose up in darfur , a vast western area the size of france , in february 2003 .

only four managed to meet the internationally agreed aid quota . in a report that names and shames some of the european union 's richest states , a number of non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- have accused the likes of germany and italy of keeping their purse strings tightened when it comes to helping the world 's poorest countries the report released on monday by action aid , eurodad and oxfam accuses europe 's misers in the wake of the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- meeting during which the world 's wealthiest nations pledged to rid the world 's poorest countries of their crippling debt but failed to meet africa 's demand for immediate action . the european relief agencies published a damning critique of member states ' efforts to address the issue , saying that g7 countries such as germany and italy did too little to meet a united nations target to reduce poverty in the world by 2015 . eu majority are " way off track " the combined data showed that only four eu states had fulfilled a promise made in 1970 by the world 's rich countries to give 0.7 percent of their gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- as foreign aid .
" the other 21 eu states are still a long way off track in terms of their promise ... this is inexcusable , " the report stated . those eu states that avoided the report 's scorn included luxembourg , which gives 0.8 percent of gni in aid , and sweden , which has also met the 0.7 percent target , saying these in particular deserved " gold stars " for their efforts .
the report also praised the netherlands for giving 0.81 percent , but said its gold star was at risk because the government wanted to count security-related expenditures as aid . even euro champ gets stingier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's " leading champion " was denmark , which currently pays the most of all eu states with 0.84 percent .
however , there were reservations in the report as to denmark 's future intentions as the danish government had been cutting down on aid spending since 2001 , when it gave 1.03 percent . " the eu must take positive action on three issues : improving the quantity and quality of international aid ; easing the burden of unsustainable debt ; and making the rules for world trade fairer , " the report stated . germany 's goal overly optimistic , says report singling out german chancellor gerhard schröder , the leader of the eu 's largest economy , for particular criticism , the report said that schröder 's promise at the world economic forum in davos that germany would reach the 0.7 percent goal in the " medium term " was optimistic at best .
" on current trends , germany will not reach the 0.7 percent until 2087 , which is a long way from being in the ' medium term ' , " the report said . italy also found itself in the firing line : " italy is one of the world 's wealthiest nations , yet it gives only a miserly 0.17 percent of its gni in aid . " g7 indecision compounds aid misery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministers of the group of seven major industrial countries .
despite the efforts of british finance minister gordon brown , who presented a plan for helping africa in what he called a " make or break year , " the g7 failed to agree on the proposals which would have freed up an extra € 38.4 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year for poor countries and completely write off their debts . an agreement was eventually reached on the subject of debt relief but the increase in cash remained contentious . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2005 fear in the schoolyard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just simple teasing schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .
teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . helge dietrich says that his students ' favorite expression is " son of a bitch . " a teacher at a high school in berlin 's mitte district and state chairman of the trade union for teachers -lrb- vde -rrb- , dietrich has been observing an increase in rowdy behavior at schools in berlin .
" it does n't take very long for verbal abuse to then turn into fisticuffs , " dietrich said . dietrich 's experience illustrates what his organization and the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- were trying to draw attention to at a meeting in berlin on monday : that violence in german schools is on the rise . schools helpless various studies support the claim .
statistics from berlin 's education department show that almost 19 percent of the 560 cases of school violence registered in 2003 - 04 took place on the way to school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , an investigation by the federal criminal office found that 5 percent of all students regularly engaged in violence ; a third occasionally indulged in fights .
a separate study by the weisser ring , an association for crime victims , found that every third student was too scared to cross the schoolyard during recess or even step on to the road leading to the school .
every second girl said she was frightened on the way to school and back home . " the quality of violence has increased and in a negative way , " said ludwig eckinger , vde national head .
" that means students are ready to hit more quickly even when their so-called victim is already injured .
we 're observing this aggressive behavior in all kinds of school and all over the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aggressive behavior at school can take many forms - from bullying a fellow student , abusing him , jostling him , stealing his jacket or sneakers to actual physical injury .
most teachers and schools are said to be overwhelmed by the dimensions of the problem . closer links between schools and police to counter the growing menace , the vde and the dpolg unveiled a new initiative in berlin on monday which foresees an intensified cooperation between schools and the police . wolfgang speck , chairman of the dpolg pointed out that school teachers and police in germany have already been working together for decades when it comes to teaching traffic sense and regulations to students or providing them information on the dangers of drug abuse .
the two can now work together along the same lines when it comes to containing violence at schools , speck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed police enter the gutenberg school in erfurt on april 26 , 2002 after a student ran amok and killed 18 people .
in future , uniformed officers are expected to be a regular feature in school corridors .
police officials will also conduct preventive classes in dealing with violence , which is already the case in some german states , including berlin . the new initiative also foresees every school having their own contact person in the next police station and vice versa .
they are expected to exchange information on potentially violent students .
" that means that when a violent incident takes place at a school the designated police officer arrives there as soon as possible .
that gives the message : when something untoward happens the police are there , " said speck . the close contact between schools and the cops is also meant to build trust , in particular among young foreign students who often have bad experiences with the police in their countries of origin . hurdles to overcome the concept already seems to be working in some places , such as the school in berlin where helge dietrich teaches .
" the police who come to our school , go into the classrooms and make it clear to the students what violence actually is , " said dietrich .
" they also familiarize the students with how they can deescalate violence . " despite the optimism surrounding the new initiative , cooperation between the police and schools is not expected to be all smooth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to the fact that many states are unable to fund such projects in the face of dwindling coffers , the police 's demand that all offenses at school be reported to them are also said to be unpopular among school directors worried that it might damage the reputation of their institutions . " actually every school director should be happy about such offers -lrb- of cooperation with the police -rrb- and one must be ready to learn that what is a deficit is n't necessarily a statement on how bad a school is , " said eckinger .
" instead , the director should say , ' we want to solve the problem ' . " that 's also a reason why the police suspect that the actual cases of violence at schools may be much higher than the statistics show , given that many simply go unreported . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de school violence trial begins in germany a whole german school class accused of torturing a fellow-student goes on trial tuesday .
the students , aged 16 to 18 , are accused of torturing a classmate over months and filming themselves doing so .

beckenbauer said the co-presidency was n't working .
" the co-presidency was decided in good faith but it can not work , " beckenbauer said .

" naturally , that is creating a negative image . "
he said that in the interests of the world cup he hoped the scandal would be " cleared up as quickly as possible .

the files includes fixtures from the bundesliga , german cup , friendlies and an indoor competition .
hoyzer acted as referee in 36 of them , assistant referee in six others and supervisory referee in the remaining 21 . hoyzer admitted in january to fixing several matches in return for cash from the croatian bookmaking mafia .
he is believed to have received a total of € 67,000 -lrb- $ 87,200 -rrb- and a plasma television screen for manipulating the games .
hoyzer was arrested and placed in police custody on saturday because of fears he might flee the country . repeat of rigged game a dfb sport panel also decided on tuesday for the first time to repeat a second league game between lr ahlen and wacker burghausen that hoyzer apparently rigged .
the game originally took place last october with a 1:0 victory for ahlen .
hoyzer has admitted that he manipulated it with deliberate foul judgments . " hoyzer is a notorious liar , " said ahlen 's legal counsel christoph schickhardt .
" until saturday he believed he was in the movies and the main protagonist , " schickhardt said referring to hoyzer 's television appearance on various talk shows before his arrest . the soccer federation also suspended another second-division referee , dominik marks , on tuesday .

only four managed to meet the internationally agreed aid quota . in a report that names and shames some of the european union 's richest states , a number of non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- have accused the likes of germany and italy of keeping their purse strings tightened when it comes to helping the world 's poorest countries the report released on monday by action aid , eurodad and oxfam accuses europe 's misers in the wake of the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- meeting during which the world 's wealthiest nations pledged to rid the world 's poorest countries of their crippling debt but failed to meet africa 's demand for immediate action . the european relief agencies published a damning critique of member states ' efforts to address the issue , saying that g7 countries such as germany and italy did too little to meet a united nations target to reduce poverty in the world by 2015 . eu majority are " way off track " the combined data showed that only four eu states had fulfilled a promise made in 1970 by the world 's rich countries to give 0.7 percent of their gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- as foreign aid .
" the other 21 eu states are still a long way off track in terms of their promise ... this is inexcusable , " the report stated . those eu states that avoided the report 's scorn included luxembourg , which gives 0.8 percent of gni in aid , and sweden , which has also met the 0.7 percent target , saying these in particular deserved " gold stars " for their efforts .
the report also praised the netherlands for giving 0.81 percent , but said its gold star was at risk because the government wanted to count security-related expenditures as aid . even euro champ gets stingier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's " leading champion " was denmark , which currently pays the most of all eu states with 0.84 percent .
however , there were reservations in the report as to denmark 's future intentions as the danish government had been cutting down on aid spending since 2001 , when it gave 1.03 percent . " the eu must take positive action on three issues : improving the quantity and quality of international aid ; easing the burden of unsustainable debt ; and making the rules for world trade fairer , " the report stated . germany 's goal overly optimistic , says report singling out german chancellor gerhard schröder , the leader of the eu 's largest economy , for particular criticism , the report said that schröder 's promise at the world economic forum in davos that germany would reach the 0.7 percent goal in the " medium term " was optimistic at best .
" on current trends , germany will not reach the 0.7 percent until 2087 , which is a long way from being in the ' medium term ' , " the report said . italy also found itself in the firing line : " italy is one of the world 's wealthiest nations , yet it gives only a miserly 0.17 percent of its gni in aid . " g7 indecision compounds aid misery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministers of the group of seven major industrial countries .
despite the efforts of british finance minister gordon brown , who presented a plan for helping africa in what he called a " make or break year , " the g7 failed to agree on the proposals which would have freed up an extra € 38.4 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year for poor countries and completely write off their debts . an agreement was eventually reached on the subject of debt relief but the increase in cash remained contentious . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

amid calls for his resignation , can he take the heat ?
and what does his besmirched reputation mean for his party ? a day after foreign minister joschka fischer accepted the blame for the visa scandal , the rheinische post rubbed salt into the wound by revealing the top german diplomat had been aware of the issue for longer than previously believed - quoting a ministerial memo from march 19 , 2003 . " mass use of tourist visas has led to a considerable rise in application numbers in the commonwealth of independent states and has been exploited for several months by traffickers , " the memo said . the paper pointed out that fischer himself has said he only became aware of the problem in 2004 . opposition seizes its opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , leader of the opposition christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said tuesday that once fischer has appeared before the parliamentary commission investigating the allegations against the foreign ministry , it would be time to decide whether his political accountability would have personal consequences . in an interview with daily die welt , stoiber said that if so , fischer " would have to leave office , " adding that " the public has a right to know exactly what role the minister responsible played in the arrival of organized criminals from eastern europe . " fall-out for the coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludger volmer the accusations revolve around the foreign ministry 's controversial relaxation of restrictions on travel from march 2000 until last year , overseen by fischer 's deputy , ludger volmer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
critics say the new rules played into the hands of human traffickers and potential terrorists . whether or not the allegations of abuse prove true , the extensive media coverage threatens to erase the recent gains made in the polls by the governing social democrat-greens coalition , just days ahead of significant local elections in the northern state of schleswig-holstein - where opinion polls give the government a narrow lead - and three months before a crucial vote in the important industrial state of north rhine-westphalia . fischer under fire fischer , the figurehead of the green party and a key ally of chancellor schröder , is consistently rated germany 's most popular politician .
the opposition has always been quick to pounce on ways of undermining him - after all , slinging mud at the reputation of the coalition 's charismatic foreign minister is an easy way of damaging the government . fischer is standing his ground in the face of the oppositions ' allegations .
although he might have accepted responsibility , he 's also suggested the issue has been exaggerated .
" it 's not as if criminal people-trafficking began under the red-green coaltion .
it 's not as if forced prostitution began with red-green , " he said monday referring to the greens ' coalition with schröder 's spd .
" it 's not as if there were not considerable pressure from the previous government , " he pointed out . the greens come of age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily , former green member , now social democrat and interior minister in the federal government the affair has already led to the resignation of ludger volmer , and as fischer now struggles to retain his own credibility , the clouds of suspicion are also drifting towards interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- , another old-school green- turned-spd . jörg schönbohm , csu interior minister of the eastern german state of brandenburg , accused schily of failing to oppose what has been dubbed the " volmer decree , " the relaxing of visa restrictions that have led to the current scandal . a big scandal for a grown-up party ? many in germany will be noting that the affair has resulted in the first black mark on the greens ' hitherto unblemished report card .
while other parties have seen their integrity chipped away by scandals and mismanagement , the greens have managed to maintain a relatively squeaky-clean reputation since entering government in 1998 . " fischer will remain in office , " said eckart von klaeden from the visa enquiry committee , " because he is simply too important for this government .

i do n't care if the war was nearly over .

dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .

if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2005 the german problem with corruption großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament dome is transparent , but that 's about it a widening match-fixing scandal and revelation of politicians ' corporate salaries have sullied germany 's once clean image .
experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .
" the perception that germany has no corruption problem has absolutely nothing to do with reality , but rather with the fact that a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light , " said uwe dolata , press spokesman for the trade union representing germany 's criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- . the berlin-based arm of transparency international , a corruption watchdog , defines corruption as " the misuse of public or private economic power for private use . "
according to economists , corruption in germany results in lower tax revenues and higher state spending , amounting to losses of some € 200 billion -lrb- $ 259 billion -rrb- yearly . half-hearted laws ? in the face of such figures , the pressure is on to find effective ways to tackle the issue .
according to corruption experts , germany is n't doing enough to address the problem and needs to amend its body of law on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for instance , the rules on bribing members of the german or state parliament are so narrowly formulated that not a single case has been punished so far , " said dolata of the bdk . the law , which dates from 1994 , penalizes the " buying of votes " but only for voting rounds held in the german parliament or bundestag .
" you need to expand that law and also make corruption in other panels where preliminary political decisions are taken punishable , " said dagmar schröder , head of the german chapter of transparency international . experts cite germany 's 1999 international bribery law that forbids german companies from bribing members of parliament abroad as another example of regulations that do n't go far enough . " that means that if a german businessman greases the palms of a member of parliament abroad , he can be punished , " said dolata .
" but if he offers the same money to a german member of parliament , he ca n't be penalized . " taking pointers from scandinavia ? experts say that germany could pick up a few lessons in fighting corruption from scandinavian countries , who lead the way when it comes to battling fraud .
according to transparency international 's corruption index , finland is the least corrupt nation worldwide .
such a high ranking is linked to scandinavia 's dominating " culture of transparency , " said dagmar schröder and urged introducing a " glass member of parliament " concept for germany too , which would require politicians to publicly declare all their income . # b # a further area where germany has its work cut out is in the economic sector , which schröder said " is significantly more corrupt , in particular because the financial sums involved are so high . " transparency international is thus urging a corporate criminal law modeled on the one practiced in switzerland , whereby companies are held accountable for corruption cases .
in addition , the watchdog wants corrupt companies to be barred from receiving public contracts . angela göpfert -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced german referee arrested disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer , who has admitted accepting bribes to manipulate matches , was arrested by police on saturday amid fears that he would try to flee the country .

" since june the work has been at a standstill while we 've had to put out one fire after another , " beckenbauer said . the dfb is being jointly run until the world cup is over by outgoing gerhard mayer-vorfelder and incoming theo zwanziger .
beckenbauer said the co-presidency was n't working .
" the co-presidency was decided in good faith but it can not work , " beckenbauer said .
" too much effort is being wasted on side issues .
but we have to live with this compromise .
we 've taken the responsibility and we have to see it through . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german footballers bernd schneider -lrb- bayer leverkusen , right -rrb- und robert huth -lrb- fc chelsea london -rrb- with the world cup mascot .
referring to the match-fixing scandal , which has taken on unforeseen proportions , beckenbauer said it was tarnishing german soccer 's image at a sensitive time when the country is readying to host the world cup next year .
" every sports newspaper in the world is writing about this , " beckenbauer said .
" naturally , that is creating a negative image . "
he said that in the interests of the world cup he hoped the scandal would be " cleared up as quickly as possible . " ref to be quizzed over 63 matches on tuesday , further wide-reaching revelations emerged from the deepening match-fixing scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer robert hoyzer , the referee in the eye of the scandal , is to be grilled by police on a total of 63 games he was involved in , the dfb announced . the federation has handed the list of matches to police in berlin investigating the 25-year-old who last month admitted manipulating results for cash .
the files includes fixtures from the bundesliga , german cup , friendlies and an indoor competition .
hoyzer acted as referee in 36 of them , assistant referee in six others and supervisory referee in the remaining 21 . hoyzer admitted in january to fixing several matches in return for cash from the croatian bookmaking mafia .
he is believed to have received a total of € 67,000 -lrb- $ 87,200 -rrb- and a plasma television screen for manipulating the games .
hoyzer was arrested and placed in police custody on saturday because of fears he might flee the country . repeat of rigged game a dfb sport panel also decided on tuesday for the first time to repeat a second league game between lr ahlen and wacker burghausen that hoyzer apparently rigged .
the game originally took place last october with a 1:0 victory for ahlen .
hoyzer has admitted that he manipulated it with deliberate foul judgments . " hoyzer is a notorious liar , " said ahlen 's legal counsel christoph schickhardt .
" until saturday he believed he was in the movies and the main protagonist , " schickhardt said referring to hoyzer 's television appearance on various talk shows before his arrest . the soccer federation also suspended another second-division referee , dominik marks , on tuesday .

though it is expected to pass in spain , observers say it 's anything but a sure thing elsewhere . on april 15th , a copy of the european union constitution will hitch a ride with a russian rocket into space .
brussels apparently wants the extraterrestrial stunt to prove to the world that around half a billion europeans from 25 countries are all unitedly striving for " peace , freedom and prosperity . "
but , many europeans might wish the document just stayed there . discontent and general confusion regarding the document that aims to streamline bureaucracy in the 25-member bloc and chart the course europe will take in the future have made the constitution a difficult sell for european union leaders .
last week , french president jacques chirac and spanish prime minister josé luis rodríguez zapatero urged a gathering of about 2,000 spaniards to give the new document a chance . first of 10 the constitution “ has anchored freedom and democracy on the continent , ” said zapatero .
“ it will mean that war and dictatorship will disappear forever from europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution was put together by 150 delegates on feb .
20 , spain will be the first of 10 of the eu 's 25 member countries to put the constitution up to a referendum .
the populations of denmark , poland , the netherlands , portugal , ireland , luxembourg , the czech republic and , perhaps most importantly , france and great britain will follow in 2005 and 2006 .
opinion polls indicate that spain will approve the constitution .
but whether the other countries will follow is anyone ’ s guess . " it 's a national-driven process , which makes it quite challenging and unpredictable , " said sebastian kurpas , a constitution expert at the center for european policy studies in brussels . the document is the product of more than 16 months of work by a group of european parliamentarians , advisors and 150 other delegates , and was completed in july 2003 and blessed by eu leaders last november .
it establishes a permanent president of the european council , a body comprised of eu leaders , and combines what were two foreign representatives into one . what 's it all about ? the far left has rejected it as a global capitalist charter without adequate social protections , while the far right and nationalists have attacked it as a blueprint for a european " superstate " that would give too much power to brussels . the average european citizen , however , seems to have little idea what it 's all about .
a recent poll by the eu organization eurobarometer revealed that 33 percent of the eu citizens polled had never heard of the charter . " it 's a confusing and sometimes a contradictory document , " said kurpas .
" you are always in danger of getting stuck in details and missing the grand picture . " a european litmus test with euroskepticism on the rise , each national referendum will give brussels a good idea of how it stands with the voting country , and observers are worried domestic politicians will hijack the referendum for their own purposes .
in france , for example , social policy is likely to dominate the referendum .
in great britain , it 's likely to be immigration and asylum politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution is expected to face stiff opposition in britain .
these british european parliamentarians give a taste what 's to come . " even irrelevant issues can be become divisive in a referendum debate , " writes daniel keohane in a briefing paper published by the center for european reform in london .
" defense policy was paramount to the irish debate on the nice treaty in 2001 , even though the defense provision in that treaty did not affect ireland 's cherished policy of neutrality . " what does a " no " mean ? should one or more countries vote no on the constitution , one of three things can happen .
depending on the size and stature of the country in the union , the government will either put the constitution back to vote at a later date , send the document back to the drawing board or agree to back out of the constitution and re-negotiate its eu membership .
the latter is unlikely if , say , france were to say no . government leaders are working hard to keep something like that from happening by emphasizing the progress membership has brought to their countries . " in a country like spain , government is making a link to the big economic benefits that have come through europe that have modernized spain , " said kurpas .
the strategy gives people " a vision that europe is a benefit . " referenda as a democratic tool over the past two months , the spanish government spent € 7.5 million on an education campaign including spanish celebrities that seems to have had some effect .
a little over 51 percent of the population is in favor of a constitution , 10 percent more than before the campaign got underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spains prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero speaks at the opening of the european constitution campaign in madrid thursday night feb .

one thing the referendums do is give european citizens an unusual amount of direct involvement in a major eu decision .
observers think more referendums might be a good way to increase awareness and involvement by europeans in the eu in the future .
" following so many referenda on the constitutional treaty , it will be difficult for governments not to put other kinds of eu issues to a public vote , " argued keohane .
he added that " in the future , it will be harder for critics to claim that the eu is inherently undemocratic .

" germany is fundamentally ready to participate on this basis , " the spokesman , thomas steg , said at a routine government media conference . un secretary general kofi annan has urged the security council to " assume its responsibility " for peace and security in sudan 's troubled darfur region , and at the weekend appealed to the european union and nato to become involved .
annan has asked for a peacekeeping operation , involving more than 10,000 personnel , to be launched . ethnic rebels rose up in darfur , a vast western area the size of france , in february 2003 .
the rebellion was put down by the arab-led government with the help of arab militias known as janjaweed .

germany 's role in the mission will be limited as it will send only military observers and staff officers for the headquarters , the paper quoted german military sources as saying germany 's bundestag lower house of parliament approved on december 3 a government plan to make some 200 soldiers available to the african union to help resolve the crisis in darfur . resolution hopes to bring peace and justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un draft resolution for sudan would require the troops to monitor a peace agreement between sudan 's government and rebels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.02.2005 germany debates the right of assembly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposals would ban npd rallies but would they infringe civil rights ?
in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .
while under existing law it is possible to ban gatherings that “ represent a danger for public security and order , ” the new measures could - at least in theory - permit a ban when there is “ no threat of a criminal violation of public security . ” restrictions on more than just far-right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will anti-war demonstrators come under the same restrictions as neo-nazis ?
in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .

if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .
traces of the militarily dubious decision to bomb the city remain visible today .

teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . helge dietrich says that his students ' favorite expression is " son of a bitch . " a teacher at a high school in berlin 's mitte district and state chairman of the trade union for teachers -lrb- vde -rrb- , dietrich has been observing an increase in rowdy behavior at schools in berlin .
" it does n't take very long for verbal abuse to then turn into fisticuffs , " dietrich said . dietrich 's experience illustrates what his organization and the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- were trying to draw attention to at a meeting in berlin on monday : that violence in german schools is on the rise . schools helpless various studies support the claim .
statistics from berlin 's education department show that almost 19 percent of the 560 cases of school violence registered in 2003 - 04 took place on the way to school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , an investigation by the federal criminal office found that 5 percent of all students regularly engaged in violence ; a third occasionally indulged in fights .
a separate study by the weisser ring , an association for crime victims , found that every third student was too scared to cross the schoolyard during recess or even step on to the road leading to the school .
every second girl said she was frightened on the way to school and back home . " the quality of violence has increased and in a negative way , " said ludwig eckinger , vde national head .
" that means students are ready to hit more quickly even when their so-called victim is already injured .
we 're observing this aggressive behavior in all kinds of school and all over the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aggressive behavior at school can take many forms - from bullying a fellow student , abusing him , jostling him , stealing his jacket or sneakers to actual physical injury .
most teachers and schools are said to be overwhelmed by the dimensions of the problem . closer links between schools and police to counter the growing menace , the vde and the dpolg unveiled a new initiative in berlin on monday which foresees an intensified cooperation between schools and the police . wolfgang speck , chairman of the dpolg pointed out that school teachers and police in germany have already been working together for decades when it comes to teaching traffic sense and regulations to students or providing them information on the dangers of drug abuse .
the two can now work together along the same lines when it comes to containing violence at schools , speck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed police enter the gutenberg school in erfurt on april 26 , 2002 after a student ran amok and killed 18 people .

police officials will also conduct preventive classes in dealing with violence , which is already the case in some german states , including berlin . the new initiative also foresees every school having their own contact person in the next police station and vice versa .
they are expected to exchange information on potentially violent students .
" that means that when a violent incident takes place at a school the designated police officer arrives there as soon as possible .
that gives the message : when something untoward happens the police are there , " said speck . the close contact between schools and the cops is also meant to build trust , in particular among young foreign students who often have bad experiences with the police in their countries of origin . hurdles to overcome the concept already seems to be working in some places , such as the school in berlin where helge dietrich teaches .
" the police who come to our school , go into the classrooms and make it clear to the students what violence actually is , " said dietrich .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2005 the german problem with corruption großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament dome is transparent , but that 's about it a widening match-fixing scandal and revelation of politicians ' corporate salaries have sullied germany 's once clean image .
experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .
" the perception that germany has no corruption problem has absolutely nothing to do with reality , but rather with the fact that a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light , " said uwe dolata , press spokesman for the trade union representing germany 's criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- . the berlin-based arm of transparency international , a corruption watchdog , defines corruption as " the misuse of public or private economic power for private use . "
according to economists , corruption in germany results in lower tax revenues and higher state spending , amounting to losses of some € 200 billion -lrb- $ 259 billion -rrb- yearly . half-hearted laws ? in the face of such figures , the pressure is on to find effective ways to tackle the issue .
according to corruption experts , germany is n't doing enough to address the problem and needs to amend its body of law on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for instance , the rules on bribing members of the german or state parliament are so narrowly formulated that not a single case has been punished so far , " said dolata of the bdk . the law , which dates from 1994 , penalizes the " buying of votes " but only for voting rounds held in the german parliament or bundestag .
" you need to expand that law and also make corruption in other panels where preliminary political decisions are taken punishable , " said dagmar schröder , head of the german chapter of transparency international . experts cite germany 's 1999 international bribery law that forbids german companies from bribing members of parliament abroad as another example of regulations that do n't go far enough . " that means that if a german businessman greases the palms of a member of parliament abroad , he can be punished , " said dolata .
" but if he offers the same money to a german member of parliament , he ca n't be penalized . " taking pointers from scandinavia ? experts say that germany could pick up a few lessons in fighting corruption from scandinavian countries , who lead the way when it comes to battling fraud .
according to transparency international 's corruption index , finland is the least corrupt nation worldwide .
such a high ranking is linked to scandinavia 's dominating " culture of transparency , " said dagmar schröder and urged introducing a " glass member of parliament " concept for germany too , which would require politicians to publicly declare all their income . # b # a further area where germany has its work cut out is in the economic sector , which schröder said " is significantly more corrupt , in particular because the financial sums involved are so high . " transparency international is thus urging a corporate criminal law modeled on the one practiced in switzerland , whereby companies are held accountable for corruption cases .
in addition , the watchdog wants corrupt companies to be barred from receiving public contracts . angela göpfert -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced german referee arrested disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer , who has admitted accepting bribes to manipulate matches , was arrested by police on saturday amid fears that he would try to flee the country .

experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .
" the perception that germany has no corruption problem has absolutely nothing to do with reality , but rather with the fact that a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light , " said uwe dolata , press spokesman for the trade union representing germany 's criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- . the berlin-based arm of transparency international , a corruption watchdog , defines corruption as " the misuse of public or private economic power for private use . "
according to economists , corruption in germany results in lower tax revenues and higher state spending , amounting to losses of some € 200 billion -lrb- $ 259 billion -rrb- yearly . half-hearted laws ? in the face of such figures , the pressure is on to find effective ways to tackle the issue .
according to corruption experts , germany is n't doing enough to address the problem and needs to amend its body of law on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for instance , the rules on bribing members of the german or state parliament are so narrowly formulated that not a single case has been punished so far , " said dolata of the bdk . the law , which dates from 1994 , penalizes the " buying of votes " but only for voting rounds held in the german parliament or bundestag .
" you need to expand that law and also make corruption in other panels where preliminary political decisions are taken punishable , " said dagmar schröder , head of the german chapter of transparency international . experts cite germany 's 1999 international bribery law that forbids german companies from bribing members of parliament abroad as another example of regulations that do n't go far enough . " that means that if a german businessman greases the palms of a member of parliament abroad , he can be punished , " said dolata .
" but if he offers the same money to a german member of parliament , he ca n't be penalized . " taking pointers from scandinavia ? experts say that germany could pick up a few lessons in fighting corruption from scandinavian countries , who lead the way when it comes to battling fraud .
according to transparency international 's corruption index , finland is the least corrupt nation worldwide .
such a high ranking is linked to scandinavia 's dominating " culture of transparency , " said dagmar schröder and urged introducing a " glass member of parliament " concept for germany too , which would require politicians to publicly declare all their income . # b # a further area where germany has its work cut out is in the economic sector , which schröder said " is significantly more corrupt , in particular because the financial sums involved are so high .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.02.2005 germany debates the right of assembly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposals would ban npd rallies but would they infringe civil rights ?
in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .
while under existing law it is possible to ban gatherings that “ represent a danger for public security and order , ” the new measures could - at least in theory - permit a ban when there is “ no threat of a criminal violation of public security . ” restrictions on more than just far-right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will anti-war demonstrators come under the same restrictions as neo-nazis ?
in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .

amid calls for his resignation , can he take the heat ?
and what does his besmirched reputation mean for his party ? a day after foreign minister joschka fischer accepted the blame for the visa scandal , the rheinische post rubbed salt into the wound by revealing the top german diplomat had been aware of the issue for longer than previously believed - quoting a ministerial memo from march 19 , 2003 . " mass use of tourist visas has led to a considerable rise in application numbers in the commonwealth of independent states and has been exploited for several months by traffickers , " the memo said . the paper pointed out that fischer himself has said he only became aware of the problem in 2004 . opposition seizes its opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , leader of the opposition christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said tuesday that once fischer has appeared before the parliamentary commission investigating the allegations against the foreign ministry , it would be time to decide whether his political accountability would have personal consequences . in an interview with daily die welt , stoiber said that if so , fischer " would have to leave office , " adding that " the public has a right to know exactly what role the minister responsible played in the arrival of organized criminals from eastern europe . " fall-out for the coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludger volmer the accusations revolve around the foreign ministry 's controversial relaxation of restrictions on travel from march 2000 until last year , overseen by fischer 's deputy , ludger volmer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
critics say the new rules played into the hands of human traffickers and potential terrorists . whether or not the allegations of abuse prove true , the extensive media coverage threatens to erase the recent gains made in the polls by the governing social democrat-greens coalition , just days ahead of significant local elections in the northern state of schleswig-holstein - where opinion polls give the government a narrow lead - and three months before a crucial vote in the important industrial state of north rhine-westphalia . fischer under fire fischer , the figurehead of the green party and a key ally of chancellor schröder , is consistently rated germany 's most popular politician .
the opposition has always been quick to pounce on ways of undermining him - after all , slinging mud at the reputation of the coalition 's charismatic foreign minister is an easy way of damaging the government . fischer is standing his ground in the face of the oppositions ' allegations .
although he might have accepted responsibility , he 's also suggested the issue has been exaggerated .
" it 's not as if criminal people-trafficking began under the red-green coaltion .
it 's not as if forced prostitution began with red-green , " he said monday referring to the greens ' coalition with schröder 's spd .
" it 's not as if there were not considerable pressure from the previous government , " he pointed out . the greens come of age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily , former green member , now social democrat and interior minister in the federal government the affair has already led to the resignation of ludger volmer , and as fischer now struggles to retain his own credibility , the clouds of suspicion are also drifting towards interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- , another old-school green- turned-spd . jörg schönbohm , csu interior minister of the eastern german state of brandenburg , accused schily of failing to oppose what has been dubbed the " volmer decree , " the relaxing of visa restrictions that have led to the current scandal . a big scandal for a grown-up party ? many in germany will be noting that the affair has resulted in the first black mark on the greens ' hitherto unblemished report card .
while other parties have seen their integrity chipped away by scandals and mismanagement , the greens have managed to maintain a relatively squeaky-clean reputation since entering government in 1998 . " fischer will remain in office , " said eckart von klaeden from the visa enquiry committee , " because he is simply too important for this government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.02.2005 germany debates the right of assembly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposals would ban npd rallies but would they infringe civil rights ?
in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .
while under existing law it is possible to ban gatherings that “ represent a danger for public security and order , ” the new measures could - at least in theory - permit a ban when there is “ no threat of a criminal violation of public security . ” restrictions on more than just far-right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will anti-war demonstrators come under the same restrictions as neo-nazis ?
in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2005 fear in the schoolyard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just simple teasing schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .
teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . helge dietrich says that his students ' favorite expression is " son of a bitch . " a teacher at a high school in berlin 's mitte district and state chairman of the trade union for teachers -lrb- vde -rrb- , dietrich has been observing an increase in rowdy behavior at schools in berlin .
" it does n't take very long for verbal abuse to then turn into fisticuffs , " dietrich said . dietrich 's experience illustrates what his organization and the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- were trying to draw attention to at a meeting in berlin on monday : that violence in german schools is on the rise . schools helpless various studies support the claim .
statistics from berlin 's education department show that almost 19 percent of the 560 cases of school violence registered in 2003 - 04 took place on the way to school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , an investigation by the federal criminal office found that 5 percent of all students regularly engaged in violence ; a third occasionally indulged in fights .
a separate study by the weisser ring , an association for crime victims , found that every third student was too scared to cross the schoolyard during recess or even step on to the road leading to the school .
every second girl said she was frightened on the way to school and back home . " the quality of violence has increased and in a negative way , " said ludwig eckinger , vde national head .
" that means students are ready to hit more quickly even when their so-called victim is already injured .
we 're observing this aggressive behavior in all kinds of school and all over the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aggressive behavior at school can take many forms - from bullying a fellow student , abusing him , jostling him , stealing his jacket or sneakers to actual physical injury .
most teachers and schools are said to be overwhelmed by the dimensions of the problem . closer links between schools and police to counter the growing menace , the vde and the dpolg unveiled a new initiative in berlin on monday which foresees an intensified cooperation between schools and the police . wolfgang speck , chairman of the dpolg pointed out that school teachers and police in germany have already been working together for decades when it comes to teaching traffic sense and regulations to students or providing them information on the dangers of drug abuse .
the two can now work together along the same lines when it comes to containing violence at schools , speck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed police enter the gutenberg school in erfurt on april 26 , 2002 after a student ran amok and killed 18 people .
in future , uniformed officers are expected to be a regular feature in school corridors .
police officials will also conduct preventive classes in dealing with violence , which is already the case in some german states , including berlin . the new initiative also foresees every school having their own contact person in the next police station and vice versa .
they are expected to exchange information on potentially violent students .
" that means that when a violent incident takes place at a school the designated police officer arrives there as soon as possible .
that gives the message : when something untoward happens the police are there , " said speck . the close contact between schools and the cops is also meant to build trust , in particular among young foreign students who often have bad experiences with the police in their countries of origin . hurdles to overcome the concept already seems to be working in some places , such as the school in berlin where helge dietrich teaches .
" the police who come to our school , go into the classrooms and make it clear to the students what violence actually is , " said dietrich .
" they also familiarize the students with how they can deescalate violence . " despite the optimism surrounding the new initiative , cooperation between the police and schools is not expected to be all smooth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to the fact that many states are unable to fund such projects in the face of dwindling coffers , the police 's demand that all offenses at school be reported to them are also said to be unpopular among school directors worried that it might damage the reputation of their institutions . " actually every school director should be happy about such offers -lrb- of cooperation with the police -rrb- and one must be ready to learn that what is a deficit is n't necessarily a statement on how bad a school is , " said eckinger .
" instead , the director should say , ' we want to solve the problem ' . " that 's also a reason why the police suspect that the actual cases of violence at schools may be much higher than the statistics show , given that many simply go unreported . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de school violence trial begins in germany a whole german school class accused of torturing a fellow-student goes on trial tuesday .

dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .

experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .
" the perception that germany has no corruption problem has absolutely nothing to do with reality , but rather with the fact that a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light , " said uwe dolata , press spokesman for the trade union representing germany 's criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- . the berlin-based arm of transparency international , a corruption watchdog , defines corruption as " the misuse of public or private economic power for private use . "
according to economists , corruption in germany results in lower tax revenues and higher state spending , amounting to losses of some € 200 billion -lrb- $ 259 billion -rrb- yearly . half-hearted laws ? in the face of such figures , the pressure is on to find effective ways to tackle the issue .
according to corruption experts , germany is n't doing enough to address the problem and needs to amend its body of law on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for instance , the rules on bribing members of the german or state parliament are so narrowly formulated that not a single case has been punished so far , " said dolata of the bdk . the law , which dates from 1994 , penalizes the " buying of votes " but only for voting rounds held in the german parliament or bundestag .
" you need to expand that law and also make corruption in other panels where preliminary political decisions are taken punishable , " said dagmar schröder , head of the german chapter of transparency international . experts cite germany 's 1999 international bribery law that forbids german companies from bribing members of parliament abroad as another example of regulations that do n't go far enough . " that means that if a german businessman greases the palms of a member of parliament abroad , he can be punished , " said dolata .
" but if he offers the same money to a german member of parliament , he ca n't be penalized . " taking pointers from scandinavia ? experts say that germany could pick up a few lessons in fighting corruption from scandinavian countries , who lead the way when it comes to battling fraud .
according to transparency international 's corruption index , finland is the least corrupt nation worldwide .
such a high ranking is linked to scandinavia 's dominating " culture of transparency , " said dagmar schröder and urged introducing a " glass member of parliament " concept for germany too , which would require politicians to publicly declare all their income . # b # a further area where germany has its work cut out is in the economic sector , which schröder said " is significantly more corrupt , in particular because the financial sums involved are so high .

though it is expected to pass in spain , observers say it 's anything but a sure thing elsewhere . on april 15th , a copy of the european union constitution will hitch a ride with a russian rocket into space .
brussels apparently wants the extraterrestrial stunt to prove to the world that around half a billion europeans from 25 countries are all unitedly striving for " peace , freedom and prosperity . "
but , many europeans might wish the document just stayed there . discontent and general confusion regarding the document that aims to streamline bureaucracy in the 25-member bloc and chart the course europe will take in the future have made the constitution a difficult sell for european union leaders .
last week , french president jacques chirac and spanish prime minister josé luis rodríguez zapatero urged a gathering of about 2,000 spaniards to give the new document a chance . first of 10 the constitution “ has anchored freedom and democracy on the continent , ” said zapatero .
“ it will mean that war and dictatorship will disappear forever from europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution was put together by 150 delegates on feb .
20 , spain will be the first of 10 of the eu 's 25 member countries to put the constitution up to a referendum .
the populations of denmark , poland , the netherlands , portugal , ireland , luxembourg , the czech republic and , perhaps most importantly , france and great britain will follow in 2005 and 2006 .
opinion polls indicate that spain will approve the constitution .
but whether the other countries will follow is anyone ’ s guess . " it 's a national-driven process , which makes it quite challenging and unpredictable , " said sebastian kurpas , a constitution expert at the center for european policy studies in brussels . the document is the product of more than 16 months of work by a group of european parliamentarians , advisors and 150 other delegates , and was completed in july 2003 and blessed by eu leaders last november .
it establishes a permanent president of the european council , a body comprised of eu leaders , and combines what were two foreign representatives into one . what 's it all about ? the far left has rejected it as a global capitalist charter without adequate social protections , while the far right and nationalists have attacked it as a blueprint for a european " superstate " that would give too much power to brussels . the average european citizen , however , seems to have little idea what it 's all about .
a recent poll by the eu organization eurobarometer revealed that 33 percent of the eu citizens polled had never heard of the charter . " it 's a confusing and sometimes a contradictory document , " said kurpas .
" you are always in danger of getting stuck in details and missing the grand picture . " a european litmus test with euroskepticism on the rise , each national referendum will give brussels a good idea of how it stands with the voting country , and observers are worried domestic politicians will hijack the referendum for their own purposes .
in france , for example , social policy is likely to dominate the referendum .
in great britain , it 's likely to be immigration and asylum politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution is expected to face stiff opposition in britain .
these british european parliamentarians give a taste what 's to come . " even irrelevant issues can be become divisive in a referendum debate , " writes daniel keohane in a briefing paper published by the center for european reform in london .
" defense policy was paramount to the irish debate on the nice treaty in 2001 , even though the defense provision in that treaty did not affect ireland 's cherished policy of neutrality . " what does a " no " mean ? should one or more countries vote no on the constitution , one of three things can happen .
depending on the size and stature of the country in the union , the government will either put the constitution back to vote at a later date , send the document back to the drawing board or agree to back out of the constitution and re-negotiate its eu membership .
the latter is unlikely if , say , france were to say no . government leaders are working hard to keep something like that from happening by emphasizing the progress membership has brought to their countries . " in a country like spain , government is making a link to the big economic benefits that have come through europe that have modernized spain , " said kurpas .
the strategy gives people " a vision that europe is a benefit . " referenda as a democratic tool over the past two months , the spanish government spent € 7.5 million on an education campaign including spanish celebrities that seems to have had some effect .

though it is expected to pass in spain , observers say it 's anything but a sure thing elsewhere . on april 15th , a copy of the european union constitution will hitch a ride with a russian rocket into space .
brussels apparently wants the extraterrestrial stunt to prove to the world that around half a billion europeans from 25 countries are all unitedly striving for " peace , freedom and prosperity . "
but , many europeans might wish the document just stayed there . discontent and general confusion regarding the document that aims to streamline bureaucracy in the 25-member bloc and chart the course europe will take in the future have made the constitution a difficult sell for european union leaders .
last week , french president jacques chirac and spanish prime minister josé luis rodríguez zapatero urged a gathering of about 2,000 spaniards to give the new document a chance . first of 10 the constitution “ has anchored freedom and democracy on the continent , ” said zapatero .
“ it will mean that war and dictatorship will disappear forever from europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution was put together by 150 delegates on feb .
20 , spain will be the first of 10 of the eu 's 25 member countries to put the constitution up to a referendum .
the populations of denmark , poland , the netherlands , portugal , ireland , luxembourg , the czech republic and , perhaps most importantly , france and great britain will follow in 2005 and 2006 .
opinion polls indicate that spain will approve the constitution .
but whether the other countries will follow is anyone ’ s guess . " it 's a national-driven process , which makes it quite challenging and unpredictable , " said sebastian kurpas , a constitution expert at the center for european policy studies in brussels . the document is the product of more than 16 months of work by a group of european parliamentarians , advisors and 150 other delegates , and was completed in july 2003 and blessed by eu leaders last november .
it establishes a permanent president of the european council , a body comprised of eu leaders , and combines what were two foreign representatives into one . what 's it all about ? the far left has rejected it as a global capitalist charter without adequate social protections , while the far right and nationalists have attacked it as a blueprint for a european " superstate " that would give too much power to brussels . the average european citizen , however , seems to have little idea what it 's all about .
a recent poll by the eu organization eurobarometer revealed that 33 percent of the eu citizens polled had never heard of the charter . " it 's a confusing and sometimes a contradictory document , " said kurpas .
" you are always in danger of getting stuck in details and missing the grand picture . " a european litmus test with euroskepticism on the rise , each national referendum will give brussels a good idea of how it stands with the voting country , and observers are worried domestic politicians will hijack the referendum for their own purposes .
in france , for example , social policy is likely to dominate the referendum .
in great britain , it 's likely to be immigration and asylum politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution is expected to face stiff opposition in britain .
these british european parliamentarians give a taste what 's to come . " even irrelevant issues can be become divisive in a referendum debate , " writes daniel keohane in a briefing paper published by the center for european reform in london .
" defense policy was paramount to the irish debate on the nice treaty in 2001 , even though the defense provision in that treaty did not affect ireland 's cherished policy of neutrality . " what does a " no " mean ? should one or more countries vote no on the constitution , one of three things can happen .
depending on the size and stature of the country in the union , the government will either put the constitution back to vote at a later date , send the document back to the drawing board or agree to back out of the constitution and re-negotiate its eu membership .
the latter is unlikely if , say , france were to say no . government leaders are working hard to keep something like that from happening by emphasizing the progress membership has brought to their countries . " in a country like spain , government is making a link to the big economic benefits that have come through europe that have modernized spain , " said kurpas .
the strategy gives people " a vision that europe is a benefit . " referenda as a democratic tool over the past two months , the spanish government spent € 7.5 million on an education campaign including spanish celebrities that seems to have had some effect .
a little over 51 percent of the population is in favor of a constitution , 10 percent more than before the campaign got underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spains prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero speaks at the opening of the european constitution campaign in madrid thursday night feb .
3 , 2005 in front of people holding signs reaing si -lrb- yes -rrb- .
one thing the referendums do is give european citizens an unusual amount of direct involvement in a major eu decision .
observers think more referendums might be a good way to increase awareness and involvement by europeans in the eu in the future .
" following so many referenda on the constitutional treaty , it will be difficult for governments not to put other kinds of eu issues to a public vote , " argued keohane .
he added that " in the future , it will be harder for critics to claim that the eu is inherently undemocratic .

experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .
" the perception that germany has no corruption problem has absolutely nothing to do with reality , but rather with the fact that a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light , " said uwe dolata , press spokesman for the trade union representing germany 's criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- . the berlin-based arm of transparency international , a corruption watchdog , defines corruption as " the misuse of public or private economic power for private use . "
according to economists , corruption in germany results in lower tax revenues and higher state spending , amounting to losses of some € 200 billion -lrb- $ 259 billion -rrb- yearly . half-hearted laws ? in the face of such figures , the pressure is on to find effective ways to tackle the issue .
according to corruption experts , germany is n't doing enough to address the problem and needs to amend its body of law on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for instance , the rules on bribing members of the german or state parliament are so narrowly formulated that not a single case has been punished so far , " said dolata of the bdk . the law , which dates from 1994 , penalizes the " buying of votes " but only for voting rounds held in the german parliament or bundestag .
" you need to expand that law and also make corruption in other panels where preliminary political decisions are taken punishable , " said dagmar schröder , head of the german chapter of transparency international . experts cite germany 's 1999 international bribery law that forbids german companies from bribing members of parliament abroad as another example of regulations that do n't go far enough . " that means that if a german businessman greases the palms of a member of parliament abroad , he can be punished , " said dolata .
" but if he offers the same money to a german member of parliament , he ca n't be penalized . " taking pointers from scandinavia ? experts say that germany could pick up a few lessons in fighting corruption from scandinavian countries , who lead the way when it comes to battling fraud .
according to transparency international 's corruption index , finland is the least corrupt nation worldwide .
such a high ranking is linked to scandinavia 's dominating " culture of transparency , " said dagmar schröder and urged introducing a " glass member of parliament " concept for germany too , which would require politicians to publicly declare all their income . # b # a further area where germany has its work cut out is in the economic sector , which schröder said " is significantly more corrupt , in particular because the financial sums involved are so high . " transparency international is thus urging a corporate criminal law modeled on the one practiced in switzerland , whereby companies are held accountable for corruption cases .

" but if he offers the same money to a german member of parliament , he ca n't be penalized . " taking pointers from scandinavia ? experts say that germany could pick up a few lessons in fighting corruption from scandinavian countries , who lead the way when it comes to battling fraud .
according to transparency international 's corruption index , finland is the least corrupt nation worldwide .
such a high ranking is linked to scandinavia 's dominating " culture of transparency , " said dagmar schröder and urged introducing a " glass member of parliament " concept for germany too , which would require politicians to publicly declare all their income . # b # a further area where germany has its work cut out is in the economic sector , which schröder said " is significantly more corrupt , in particular because the financial sums involved are so high . " transparency international is thus urging a corporate criminal law modeled on the one practiced in switzerland , whereby companies are held accountable for corruption cases .

if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .

only four managed to meet the internationally agreed aid quota . in a report that names and shames some of the european union 's richest states , a number of non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- have accused the likes of germany and italy of keeping their purse strings tightened when it comes to helping the world 's poorest countries the report released on monday by action aid , eurodad and oxfam accuses europe 's misers in the wake of the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- meeting during which the world 's wealthiest nations pledged to rid the world 's poorest countries of their crippling debt but failed to meet africa 's demand for immediate action . the european relief agencies published a damning critique of member states ' efforts to address the issue , saying that g7 countries such as germany and italy did too little to meet a united nations target to reduce poverty in the world by 2015 . eu majority are " way off track " the combined data showed that only four eu states had fulfilled a promise made in 1970 by the world 's rich countries to give 0.7 percent of their gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- as foreign aid .
" the other 21 eu states are still a long way off track in terms of their promise ... this is inexcusable , " the report stated . those eu states that avoided the report 's scorn included luxembourg , which gives 0.8 percent of gni in aid , and sweden , which has also met the 0.7 percent target , saying these in particular deserved " gold stars " for their efforts .
the report also praised the netherlands for giving 0.81 percent , but said its gold star was at risk because the government wanted to count security-related expenditures as aid . even euro champ gets stingier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's " leading champion " was denmark , which currently pays the most of all eu states with 0.84 percent .
however , there were reservations in the report as to denmark 's future intentions as the danish government had been cutting down on aid spending since 2001 , when it gave 1.03 percent . " the eu must take positive action on three issues : improving the quantity and quality of international aid ; easing the burden of unsustainable debt ; and making the rules for world trade fairer , " the report stated . germany 's goal overly optimistic , says report singling out german chancellor gerhard schröder , the leader of the eu 's largest economy , for particular criticism , the report said that schröder 's promise at the world economic forum in davos that germany would reach the 0.7 percent goal in the " medium term " was optimistic at best .
" on current trends , germany will not reach the 0.7 percent until 2087 , which is a long way from being in the ' medium term ' , " the report said . italy also found itself in the firing line : " italy is one of the world 's wealthiest nations , yet it gives only a miserly 0.17 percent of its gni in aid . " g7 indecision compounds aid misery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministers of the group of seven major industrial countries .
despite the efforts of british finance minister gordon brown , who presented a plan for helping africa in what he called a " make or break year , " the g7 failed to agree on the proposals which would have freed up an extra € 38.4 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year for poor countries and completely write off their debts . an agreement was eventually reached on the subject of debt relief but the increase in cash remained contentious . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

" since june the work has been at a standstill while we 've had to put out one fire after another , " beckenbauer said . the dfb is being jointly run until the world cup is over by outgoing gerhard mayer-vorfelder and incoming theo zwanziger .
beckenbauer said the co-presidency was n't working .
" the co-presidency was decided in good faith but it can not work , " beckenbauer said .

" naturally , that is creating a negative image . "
he said that in the interests of the world cup he hoped the scandal would be " cleared up as quickly as possible .

the files includes fixtures from the bundesliga , german cup , friendlies and an indoor competition .
hoyzer acted as referee in 36 of them , assistant referee in six others and supervisory referee in the remaining 21 . hoyzer admitted in january to fixing several matches in return for cash from the croatian bookmaking mafia .
he is believed to have received a total of € 67,000 -lrb- $ 87,200 -rrb- and a plasma television screen for manipulating the games .
hoyzer was arrested and placed in police custody on saturday because of fears he might flee the country . repeat of rigged game a dfb sport panel also decided on tuesday for the first time to repeat a second league game between lr ahlen and wacker burghausen that hoyzer apparently rigged .
the game originally took place last october with a 1:0 victory for ahlen .
hoyzer has admitted that he manipulated it with deliberate foul judgments . " hoyzer is a notorious liar , " said ahlen 's legal counsel christoph schickhardt .
" until saturday he believed he was in the movies and the main protagonist , " schickhardt said referring to hoyzer 's television appearance on various talk shows before his arrest . the soccer federation also suspended another second-division referee , dominik marks , on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the rocky road to an eu constitution all eu hopes on spain a referendum for germany after all ? eu parliament approves constitution ratifying eu constitution will be a ' tough battle ' europe -pipe- 15.02.2005 putting the constitution to the test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referenda give european citizens an unusual amount of influence this friday in spain , the eu constitution faces the first of ten national referendums .
though it is expected to pass in spain , observers say it 's anything but a sure thing elsewhere . on april 15th , a copy of the european union constitution will hitch a ride with a russian rocket into space .
brussels apparently wants the extraterrestrial stunt to prove to the world that around half a billion europeans from 25 countries are all unitedly striving for " peace , freedom and prosperity . "
but , many europeans might wish the document just stayed there . discontent and general confusion regarding the document that aims to streamline bureaucracy in the 25-member bloc and chart the course europe will take in the future have made the constitution a difficult sell for european union leaders .
last week , french president jacques chirac and spanish prime minister josé luis rodríguez zapatero urged a gathering of about 2,000 spaniards to give the new document a chance . first of 10 the constitution “ has anchored freedom and democracy on the continent , ” said zapatero .
“ it will mean that war and dictatorship will disappear forever from europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution was put together by 150 delegates on feb .
20 , spain will be the first of 10 of the eu 's 25 member countries to put the constitution up to a referendum .
the populations of denmark , poland , the netherlands , portugal , ireland , luxembourg , the czech republic and , perhaps most importantly , france and great britain will follow in 2005 and 2006 .

only four managed to meet the internationally agreed aid quota . in a report that names and shames some of the european union 's richest states , a number of non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- have accused the likes of germany and italy of keeping their purse strings tightened when it comes to helping the world 's poorest countries the report released on monday by action aid , eurodad and oxfam accuses europe 's misers in the wake of the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- meeting during which the world 's wealthiest nations pledged to rid the world 's poorest countries of their crippling debt but failed to meet africa 's demand for immediate action . the european relief agencies published a damning critique of member states ' efforts to address the issue , saying that g7 countries such as germany and italy did too little to meet a united nations target to reduce poverty in the world by 2015 . eu majority are " way off track " the combined data showed that only four eu states had fulfilled a promise made in 1970 by the world 's rich countries to give 0.7 percent of their gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- as foreign aid .
" the other 21 eu states are still a long way off track in terms of their promise ... this is inexcusable , " the report stated . those eu states that avoided the report 's scorn included luxembourg , which gives 0.8 percent of gni in aid , and sweden , which has also met the 0.7 percent target , saying these in particular deserved " gold stars " for their efforts .
the report also praised the netherlands for giving 0.81 percent , but said its gold star was at risk because the government wanted to count security-related expenditures as aid . even euro champ gets stingier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's " leading champion " was denmark , which currently pays the most of all eu states with 0.84 percent .
however , there were reservations in the report as to denmark 's future intentions as the danish government had been cutting down on aid spending since 2001 , when it gave 1.03 percent . " the eu must take positive action on three issues : improving the quantity and quality of international aid ; easing the burden of unsustainable debt ; and making the rules for world trade fairer , " the report stated . germany 's goal overly optimistic , says report singling out german chancellor gerhard schröder , the leader of the eu 's largest economy , for particular criticism , the report said that schröder 's promise at the world economic forum in davos that germany would reach the 0.7 percent goal in the " medium term " was optimistic at best .
" on current trends , germany will not reach the 0.7 percent until 2087 , which is a long way from being in the ' medium term ' , " the report said . italy also found itself in the firing line : " italy is one of the world 's wealthiest nations , yet it gives only a miserly 0.17 percent of its gni in aid . " g7 indecision compounds aid misery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministers of the group of seven major industrial countries .
despite the efforts of british finance minister gordon brown , who presented a plan for helping africa in what he called a " make or break year , " the g7 failed to agree on the proposals which would have freed up an extra € 38.4 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year for poor countries and completely write off their debts . an agreement was eventually reached on the subject of debt relief but the increase in cash remained contentious . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

" it does n't take very long for verbal abuse to then turn into fisticuffs , " dietrich said . dietrich 's experience illustrates what his organization and the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- were trying to draw attention to at a meeting in berlin on monday : that violence in german schools is on the rise . schools helpless various studies support the claim .
statistics from berlin 's education department show that almost 19 percent of the 560 cases of school violence registered in 2003 - 04 took place on the way to school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , an investigation by the federal criminal office found that 5 percent of all students regularly engaged in violence ; a third occasionally indulged in fights .
a separate study by the weisser ring , an association for crime victims , found that every third student was too scared to cross the schoolyard during recess or even step on to the road leading to the school .
every second girl said she was frightened on the way to school and back home . " the quality of violence has increased and in a negative way , " said ludwig eckinger , vde national head .

we 're observing this aggressive behavior in all kinds of school and all over the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aggressive behavior at school can take many forms - from bullying a fellow student , abusing him , jostling him , stealing his jacket or sneakers to actual physical injury .
most teachers and schools are said to be overwhelmed by the dimensions of the problem . closer links between schools and police to counter the growing menace , the vde and the dpolg unveiled a new initiative in berlin on monday which foresees an intensified cooperation between schools and the police . wolfgang speck , chairman of the dpolg pointed out that school teachers and police in germany have already been working together for decades when it comes to teaching traffic sense and regulations to students or providing them information on the dangers of drug abuse .
the two can now work together along the same lines when it comes to containing violence at schools , speck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed police enter the gutenberg school in erfurt on april 26 , 2002 after a student ran amok and killed 18 people .
in future , uniformed officers are expected to be a regular feature in school corridors .
police officials will also conduct preventive classes in dealing with violence , which is already the case in some german states , including berlin . the new initiative also foresees every school having their own contact person in the next police station and vice versa .
they are expected to exchange information on potentially violent students .
" that means that when a violent incident takes place at a school the designated police officer arrives there as soon as possible .
that gives the message : when something untoward happens the police are there , " said speck . the close contact between schools and the cops is also meant to build trust , in particular among young foreign students who often have bad experiences with the police in their countries of origin . hurdles to overcome the concept already seems to be working in some places , such as the school in berlin where helge dietrich teaches .
" the police who come to our school , go into the classrooms and make it clear to the students what violence actually is , " said dietrich .
" they also familiarize the students with how they can deescalate violence . " despite the optimism surrounding the new initiative , cooperation between the police and schools is not expected to be all smooth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to the fact that many states are unable to fund such projects in the face of dwindling coffers , the police 's demand that all offenses at school be reported to them are also said to be unpopular among school directors worried that it might damage the reputation of their institutions .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aggressive behavior at school can take many forms - from bullying a fellow student , abusing him , jostling him , stealing his jacket or sneakers to actual physical injury .
most teachers and schools are said to be overwhelmed by the dimensions of the problem . closer links between schools and police to counter the growing menace , the vde and the dpolg unveiled a new initiative in berlin on monday which foresees an intensified cooperation between schools and the police . wolfgang speck , chairman of the dpolg pointed out that school teachers and police in germany have already been working together for decades when it comes to teaching traffic sense and regulations to students or providing them information on the dangers of drug abuse .
the two can now work together along the same lines when it comes to containing violence at schools , speck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed police enter the gutenberg school in erfurt on april 26 , 2002 after a student ran amok and killed 18 people .
in future , uniformed officers are expected to be a regular feature in school corridors .
police officials will also conduct preventive classes in dealing with violence , which is already the case in some german states , including berlin . the new initiative also foresees every school having their own contact person in the next police station and vice versa .
they are expected to exchange information on potentially violent students .
" that means that when a violent incident takes place at a school the designated police officer arrives there as soon as possible .
that gives the message : when something untoward happens the police are there , " said speck . the close contact between schools and the cops is also meant to build trust , in particular among young foreign students who often have bad experiences with the police in their countries of origin . hurdles to overcome the concept already seems to be working in some places , such as the school in berlin where helge dietrich teaches .
" the police who come to our school , go into the classrooms and make it clear to the students what violence actually is , " said dietrich .
" they also familiarize the students with how they can deescalate violence . " despite the optimism surrounding the new initiative , cooperation between the police and schools is not expected to be all smooth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to the fact that many states are unable to fund such projects in the face of dwindling coffers , the police 's demand that all offenses at school be reported to them are also said to be unpopular among school directors worried that it might damage the reputation of their institutions . " actually every school director should be happy about such offers -lrb- of cooperation with the police -rrb- and one must be ready to learn that what is a deficit is n't necessarily a statement on how bad a school is , " said eckinger .
" instead , the director should say , ' we want to solve the problem ' . " that 's also a reason why the police suspect that the actual cases of violence at schools may be much higher than the statistics show , given that many simply go unreported . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de school violence trial begins in germany a whole german school class accused of torturing a fellow-student goes on trial tuesday .

in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .

the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .

in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .

" since june the work has been at a standstill while we 've had to put out one fire after another , " beckenbauer said . the dfb is being jointly run until the world cup is over by outgoing gerhard mayer-vorfelder and incoming theo zwanziger .
beckenbauer said the co-presidency was n't working .
" the co-presidency was decided in good faith but it can not work , " beckenbauer said .
" too much effort is being wasted on side issues .
but we have to live with this compromise .

referring to the match-fixing scandal , which has taken on unforeseen proportions , beckenbauer said it was tarnishing german soccer 's image at a sensitive time when the country is readying to host the world cup next year .
" every sports newspaper in the world is writing about this , " beckenbauer said .

in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .
while under existing law it is possible to ban gatherings that “ represent a danger for public security and order , ” the new measures could - at least in theory - permit a ban when there is “ no threat of a criminal violation of public security . ” restrictions on more than just far-right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will anti-war demonstrators come under the same restrictions as neo-nazis ?
in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .
while under existing law it is possible to ban gatherings that “ represent a danger for public security and order , ” the new measures could - at least in theory - permit a ban when there is “ no threat of a criminal violation of public security . ” restrictions on more than just far-right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will anti-war demonstrators come under the same restrictions as neo-nazis ?
in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.02.2005 can fischer weather the storm ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer could have been aware of the problem earlier than believed the german foreign minister 's attention was allegedly drawn to visa abuse in eastern europe two years ago .
amid calls for his resignation , can he take the heat ?
and what does his besmirched reputation mean for his party ? a day after foreign minister joschka fischer accepted the blame for the visa scandal , the rheinische post rubbed salt into the wound by revealing the top german diplomat had been aware of the issue for longer than previously believed - quoting a ministerial memo from march 19 , 2003 . " mass use of tourist visas has led to a considerable rise in application numbers in the commonwealth of independent states and has been exploited for several months by traffickers , " the memo said . the paper pointed out that fischer himself has said he only became aware of the problem in 2004 . opposition seizes its opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , leader of the opposition christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said tuesday that once fischer has appeared before the parliamentary commission investigating the allegations against the foreign ministry , it would be time to decide whether his political accountability would have personal consequences . in an interview with daily die welt , stoiber said that if so , fischer " would have to leave office , " adding that " the public has a right to know exactly what role the minister responsible played in the arrival of organized criminals from eastern europe . " fall-out for the coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludger volmer the accusations revolve around the foreign ministry 's controversial relaxation of restrictions on travel from march 2000 until last year , overseen by fischer 's deputy , ludger volmer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
critics say the new rules played into the hands of human traffickers and potential terrorists . whether or not the allegations of abuse prove true , the extensive media coverage threatens to erase the recent gains made in the polls by the governing social democrat-greens coalition , just days ahead of significant local elections in the northern state of schleswig-holstein - where opinion polls give the government a narrow lead - and three months before a crucial vote in the important industrial state of north rhine-westphalia . fischer under fire fischer , the figurehead of the green party and a key ally of chancellor schröder , is consistently rated germany 's most popular politician .
the opposition has always been quick to pounce on ways of undermining him - after all , slinging mud at the reputation of the coalition 's charismatic foreign minister is an easy way of damaging the government . fischer is standing his ground in the face of the oppositions ' allegations .
although he might have accepted responsibility , he 's also suggested the issue has been exaggerated .
" it 's not as if criminal people-trafficking began under the red-green coaltion .
it 's not as if forced prostitution began with red-green , " he said monday referring to the greens ' coalition with schröder 's spd .
" it 's not as if there were not considerable pressure from the previous government , " he pointed out . the greens come of age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily , former green member , now social democrat and interior minister in the federal government the affair has already led to the resignation of ludger volmer , and as fischer now struggles to retain his own credibility , the clouds of suspicion are also drifting towards interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- , another old-school green- turned-spd . jörg schönbohm , csu interior minister of the eastern german state of brandenburg , accused schily of failing to oppose what has been dubbed the " volmer decree , " the relaxing of visa restrictions that have led to the current scandal . a big scandal for a grown-up party ? many in germany will be noting that the affair has resulted in the first black mark on the greens ' hitherto unblemished report card .
while other parties have seen their integrity chipped away by scandals and mismanagement , the greens have managed to maintain a relatively squeaky-clean reputation since entering government in 1998 . " fischer will remain in office , " said eckart von klaeden from the visa enquiry committee , " because he is simply too important for this government .

brussels apparently wants the extraterrestrial stunt to prove to the world that around half a billion europeans from 25 countries are all unitedly striving for " peace , freedom and prosperity . "

amid calls for his resignation , can he take the heat ?
and what does his besmirched reputation mean for his party ? a day after foreign minister joschka fischer accepted the blame for the visa scandal , the rheinische post rubbed salt into the wound by revealing the top german diplomat had been aware of the issue for longer than previously believed - quoting a ministerial memo from march 19 , 2003 . " mass use of tourist visas has led to a considerable rise in application numbers in the commonwealth of independent states and has been exploited for several months by traffickers , " the memo said . the paper pointed out that fischer himself has said he only became aware of the problem in 2004 . opposition seizes its opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , leader of the opposition christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said tuesday that once fischer has appeared before the parliamentary commission investigating the allegations against the foreign ministry , it would be time to decide whether his political accountability would have personal consequences . in an interview with daily die welt , stoiber said that if so , fischer " would have to leave office , " adding that " the public has a right to know exactly what role the minister responsible played in the arrival of organized criminals from eastern europe . " fall-out for the coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludger volmer the accusations revolve around the foreign ministry 's controversial relaxation of restrictions on travel from march 2000 until last year , overseen by fischer 's deputy , ludger volmer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
critics say the new rules played into the hands of human traffickers and potential terrorists . whether or not the allegations of abuse prove true , the extensive media coverage threatens to erase the recent gains made in the polls by the governing social democrat-greens coalition , just days ahead of significant local elections in the northern state of schleswig-holstein - where opinion polls give the government a narrow lead - and three months before a crucial vote in the important industrial state of north rhine-westphalia . fischer under fire fischer , the figurehead of the green party and a key ally of chancellor schröder , is consistently rated germany 's most popular politician .
the opposition has always been quick to pounce on ways of undermining him - after all , slinging mud at the reputation of the coalition 's charismatic foreign minister is an easy way of damaging the government . fischer is standing his ground in the face of the oppositions ' allegations .
although he might have accepted responsibility , he 's also suggested the issue has been exaggerated .
" it 's not as if criminal people-trafficking began under the red-green coaltion .
it 's not as if forced prostitution began with red-green , " he said monday referring to the greens ' coalition with schröder 's spd .
" it 's not as if there were not considerable pressure from the previous government , " he pointed out . the greens come of age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily , former green member , now social democrat and interior minister in the federal government the affair has already led to the resignation of ludger volmer , and as fischer now struggles to retain his own credibility , the clouds of suspicion are also drifting towards interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- , another old-school green- turned-spd . jörg schönbohm , csu interior minister of the eastern german state of brandenburg , accused schily of failing to oppose what has been dubbed the " volmer decree , " the relaxing of visa restrictions that have led to the current scandal . a big scandal for a grown-up party ? many in germany will be noting that the affair has resulted in the first black mark on the greens ' hitherto unblemished report card .
while other parties have seen their integrity chipped away by scandals and mismanagement , the greens have managed to maintain a relatively squeaky-clean reputation since entering government in 1998 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.02.2005 germany debates the right of assembly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposals would ban npd rallies but would they infringe civil rights ?
in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .

" germany is fundamentally ready to participate on this basis , " the spokesman , thomas steg , said at a routine government media conference . un secretary general kofi annan has urged the security council to " assume its responsibility " for peace and security in sudan 's troubled darfur region , and at the weekend appealed to the european union and nato to become involved .
annan has asked for a peacekeeping operation , involving more than 10,000 personnel , to be launched . ethnic rebels rose up in darfur , a vast western area the size of france , in february 2003 .
the rebellion was put down by the arab-led government with the help of arab militias known as janjaweed .

in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .

in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .
" the perception that germany has no corruption problem has absolutely nothing to do with reality , but rather with the fact that a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light , " said uwe dolata , press spokesman for the trade union representing germany 's criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- . the berlin-based arm of transparency international , a corruption watchdog , defines corruption as " the misuse of public or private economic power for private use . "
according to economists , corruption in germany results in lower tax revenues and higher state spending , amounting to losses of some € 200 billion -lrb- $ 259 billion -rrb- yearly . half-hearted laws ? in the face of such figures , the pressure is on to find effective ways to tackle the issue .
according to corruption experts , germany is n't doing enough to address the problem and needs to amend its body of law on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for instance , the rules on bribing members of the german or state parliament are so narrowly formulated that not a single case has been punished so far , " said dolata of the bdk . the law , which dates from 1994 , penalizes the " buying of votes " but only for voting rounds held in the german parliament or bundestag .
" you need to expand that law and also make corruption in other panels where preliminary political decisions are taken punishable , " said dagmar schröder , head of the german chapter of transparency international . experts cite germany 's 1999 international bribery law that forbids german companies from bribing members of parliament abroad as another example of regulations that do n't go far enough . " that means that if a german businessman greases the palms of a member of parliament abroad , he can be punished , " said dolata .
" but if he offers the same money to a german member of parliament , he ca n't be penalized . " taking pointers from scandinavia ? experts say that germany could pick up a few lessons in fighting corruption from scandinavian countries , who lead the way when it comes to battling fraud .
according to transparency international 's corruption index , finland is the least corrupt nation worldwide .
such a high ranking is linked to scandinavia 's dominating " culture of transparency , " said dagmar schröder and urged introducing a " glass member of parliament " concept for germany too , which would require politicians to publicly declare all their income . # b # a further area where germany has its work cut out is in the economic sector , which schröder said " is significantly more corrupt , in particular because the financial sums involved are so high .

experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .
" the perception that germany has no corruption problem has absolutely nothing to do with reality , but rather with the fact that a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light , " said uwe dolata , press spokesman for the trade union representing germany 's criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- . the berlin-based arm of transparency international , a corruption watchdog , defines corruption as " the misuse of public or private economic power for private use . "
according to economists , corruption in germany results in lower tax revenues and higher state spending , amounting to losses of some € 200 billion -lrb- $ 259 billion -rrb- yearly . half-hearted laws ? in the face of such figures , the pressure is on to find effective ways to tackle the issue .
according to corruption experts , germany is n't doing enough to address the problem and needs to amend its body of law on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for instance , the rules on bribing members of the german or state parliament are so narrowly formulated that not a single case has been punished so far , " said dolata of the bdk . the law , which dates from 1994 , penalizes the " buying of votes " but only for voting rounds held in the german parliament or bundestag .
" you need to expand that law and also make corruption in other panels where preliminary political decisions are taken punishable , " said dagmar schröder , head of the german chapter of transparency international . experts cite germany 's 1999 international bribery law that forbids german companies from bribing members of parliament abroad as another example of regulations that do n't go far enough . " that means that if a german businessman greases the palms of a member of parliament abroad , he can be punished , " said dolata .
" but if he offers the same money to a german member of parliament , he ca n't be penalized . " taking pointers from scandinavia ? experts say that germany could pick up a few lessons in fighting corruption from scandinavian countries , who lead the way when it comes to battling fraud .
according to transparency international 's corruption index , finland is the least corrupt nation worldwide .
such a high ranking is linked to scandinavia 's dominating " culture of transparency , " said dagmar schröder and urged introducing a " glass member of parliament " concept for germany too , which would require politicians to publicly declare all their income . # b # a further area where germany has its work cut out is in the economic sector , which schröder said " is significantly more corrupt , in particular because the financial sums involved are so high . " transparency international is thus urging a corporate criminal law modeled on the one practiced in switzerland , whereby companies are held accountable for corruption cases .

" germany is fundamentally ready to participate on this basis , " the spokesman , thomas steg , said at a routine government media conference . un secretary general kofi annan has urged the security council to " assume its responsibility " for peace and security in sudan 's troubled darfur region , and at the weekend appealed to the european union and nato to become involved .
annan has asked for a peacekeeping operation , involving more than 10,000 personnel , to be launched . ethnic rebels rose up in darfur , a vast western area the size of france , in february 2003 .
the rebellion was put down by the arab-led government with the help of arab militias known as janjaweed .

germany 's role in the mission will be limited as it will send only military observers and staff officers for the headquarters , the paper quoted german military sources as saying germany 's bundestag lower house of parliament approved on december 3 a government plan to make some 200 soldiers available to the african union to help resolve the crisis in darfur . resolution hopes to bring peace and justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un draft resolution for sudan would require the troops to monitor a peace agreement between sudan 's government and rebels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2005 fear in the schoolyard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just simple teasing schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .
teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . helge dietrich says that his students ' favorite expression is " son of a bitch . " a teacher at a high school in berlin 's mitte district and state chairman of the trade union for teachers -lrb- vde -rrb- , dietrich has been observing an increase in rowdy behavior at schools in berlin .
" it does n't take very long for verbal abuse to then turn into fisticuffs , " dietrich said . dietrich 's experience illustrates what his organization and the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- were trying to draw attention to at a meeting in berlin on monday : that violence in german schools is on the rise . schools helpless various studies support the claim .
statistics from berlin 's education department show that almost 19 percent of the 560 cases of school violence registered in 2003 - 04 took place on the way to school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , an investigation by the federal criminal office found that 5 percent of all students regularly engaged in violence ; a third occasionally indulged in fights .
a separate study by the weisser ring , an association for crime victims , found that every third student was too scared to cross the schoolyard during recess or even step on to the road leading to the school .
every second girl said she was frightened on the way to school and back home . " the quality of violence has increased and in a negative way , " said ludwig eckinger , vde national head .
" that means students are ready to hit more quickly even when their so-called victim is already injured .
we 're observing this aggressive behavior in all kinds of school and all over the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aggressive behavior at school can take many forms - from bullying a fellow student , abusing him , jostling him , stealing his jacket or sneakers to actual physical injury .
most teachers and schools are said to be overwhelmed by the dimensions of the problem . closer links between schools and police to counter the growing menace , the vde and the dpolg unveiled a new initiative in berlin on monday which foresees an intensified cooperation between schools and the police . wolfgang speck , chairman of the dpolg pointed out that school teachers and police in germany have already been working together for decades when it comes to teaching traffic sense and regulations to students or providing them information on the dangers of drug abuse .
the two can now work together along the same lines when it comes to containing violence at schools , speck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed police enter the gutenberg school in erfurt on april 26 , 2002 after a student ran amok and killed 18 people .
in future , uniformed officers are expected to be a regular feature in school corridors .
police officials will also conduct preventive classes in dealing with violence , which is already the case in some german states , including berlin . the new initiative also foresees every school having their own contact person in the next police station and vice versa .
they are expected to exchange information on potentially violent students .
" that means that when a violent incident takes place at a school the designated police officer arrives there as soon as possible .
that gives the message : when something untoward happens the police are there , " said speck . the close contact between schools and the cops is also meant to build trust , in particular among young foreign students who often have bad experiences with the police in their countries of origin . hurdles to overcome the concept already seems to be working in some places , such as the school in berlin where helge dietrich teaches .
" the police who come to our school , go into the classrooms and make it clear to the students what violence actually is , " said dietrich .
" they also familiarize the students with how they can deescalate violence . " despite the optimism surrounding the new initiative , cooperation between the police and schools is not expected to be all smooth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to the fact that many states are unable to fund such projects in the face of dwindling coffers , the police 's demand that all offenses at school be reported to them are also said to be unpopular among school directors worried that it might damage the reputation of their institutions . " actually every school director should be happy about such offers -lrb- of cooperation with the police -rrb- and one must be ready to learn that what is a deficit is n't necessarily a statement on how bad a school is , " said eckinger .
" instead , the director should say , ' we want to solve the problem ' . " that 's also a reason why the police suspect that the actual cases of violence at schools may be much higher than the statistics show , given that many simply go unreported . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de school violence trial begins in germany a whole german school class accused of torturing a fellow-student goes on trial tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2005 fear in the schoolyard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just simple teasing schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .
teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . helge dietrich says that his students ' favorite expression is " son of a bitch . " a teacher at a high school in berlin 's mitte district and state chairman of the trade union for teachers -lrb- vde -rrb- , dietrich has been observing an increase in rowdy behavior at schools in berlin .
" it does n't take very long for verbal abuse to then turn into fisticuffs , " dietrich said . dietrich 's experience illustrates what his organization and the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- were trying to draw attention to at a meeting in berlin on monday : that violence in german schools is on the rise . schools helpless various studies support the claim .
statistics from berlin 's education department show that almost 19 percent of the 560 cases of school violence registered in 2003 - 04 took place on the way to school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , an investigation by the federal criminal office found that 5 percent of all students regularly engaged in violence ; a third occasionally indulged in fights .
a separate study by the weisser ring , an association for crime victims , found that every third student was too scared to cross the schoolyard during recess or even step on to the road leading to the school .
every second girl said she was frightened on the way to school and back home . " the quality of violence has increased and in a negative way , " said ludwig eckinger , vde national head .
" that means students are ready to hit more quickly even when their so-called victim is already injured .
we 're observing this aggressive behavior in all kinds of school and all over the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aggressive behavior at school can take many forms - from bullying a fellow student , abusing him , jostling him , stealing his jacket or sneakers to actual physical injury .
most teachers and schools are said to be overwhelmed by the dimensions of the problem . closer links between schools and police to counter the growing menace , the vde and the dpolg unveiled a new initiative in berlin on monday which foresees an intensified cooperation between schools and the police . wolfgang speck , chairman of the dpolg pointed out that school teachers and police in germany have already been working together for decades when it comes to teaching traffic sense and regulations to students or providing them information on the dangers of drug abuse .
the two can now work together along the same lines when it comes to containing violence at schools , speck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed police enter the gutenberg school in erfurt on april 26 , 2002 after a student ran amok and killed 18 people .
in future , uniformed officers are expected to be a regular feature in school corridors .
police officials will also conduct preventive classes in dealing with violence , which is already the case in some german states , including berlin . the new initiative also foresees every school having their own contact person in the next police station and vice versa .
they are expected to exchange information on potentially violent students .
" that means that when a violent incident takes place at a school the designated police officer arrives there as soon as possible .
that gives the message : when something untoward happens the police are there , " said speck . the close contact between schools and the cops is also meant to build trust , in particular among young foreign students who often have bad experiences with the police in their countries of origin . hurdles to overcome the concept already seems to be working in some places , such as the school in berlin where helge dietrich teaches .
" the police who come to our school , go into the classrooms and make it clear to the students what violence actually is , " said dietrich .
" they also familiarize the students with how they can deescalate violence . " despite the optimism surrounding the new initiative , cooperation between the police and schools is not expected to be all smooth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to the fact that many states are unable to fund such projects in the face of dwindling coffers , the police 's demand that all offenses at school be reported to them are also said to be unpopular among school directors worried that it might damage the reputation of their institutions . " actually every school director should be happy about such offers -lrb- of cooperation with the police -rrb- and one must be ready to learn that what is a deficit is n't necessarily a statement on how bad a school is , " said eckinger .
" instead , the director should say , ' we want to solve the problem ' . " that 's also a reason why the police suspect that the actual cases of violence at schools may be much higher than the statistics show , given that many simply go unreported . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de school violence trial begins in germany a whole german school class accused of torturing a fellow-student goes on trial tuesday .
the students , aged 16 to 18 , are accused of torturing a classmate over months and filming themselves doing so .

experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2005 fear in the schoolyard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just simple teasing schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .
teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . helge dietrich says that his students ' favorite expression is " son of a bitch . " a teacher at a high school in berlin 's mitte district and state chairman of the trade union for teachers -lrb- vde -rrb- , dietrich has been observing an increase in rowdy behavior at schools in berlin .
" it does n't take very long for verbal abuse to then turn into fisticuffs , " dietrich said . dietrich 's experience illustrates what his organization and the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- were trying to draw attention to at a meeting in berlin on monday : that violence in german schools is on the rise . schools helpless various studies support the claim .
statistics from berlin 's education department show that almost 19 percent of the 560 cases of school violence registered in 2003 - 04 took place on the way to school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , an investigation by the federal criminal office found that 5 percent of all students regularly engaged in violence ; a third occasionally indulged in fights .
a separate study by the weisser ring , an association for crime victims , found that every third student was too scared to cross the schoolyard during recess or even step on to the road leading to the school .
every second girl said she was frightened on the way to school and back home . " the quality of violence has increased and in a negative way , " said ludwig eckinger , vde national head .
" that means students are ready to hit more quickly even when their so-called victim is already injured .
we 're observing this aggressive behavior in all kinds of school and all over the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aggressive behavior at school can take many forms - from bullying a fellow student , abusing him , jostling him , stealing his jacket or sneakers to actual physical injury .
most teachers and schools are said to be overwhelmed by the dimensions of the problem . closer links between schools and police to counter the growing menace , the vde and the dpolg unveiled a new initiative in berlin on monday which foresees an intensified cooperation between schools and the police . wolfgang speck , chairman of the dpolg pointed out that school teachers and police in germany have already been working together for decades when it comes to teaching traffic sense and regulations to students or providing them information on the dangers of drug abuse .
the two can now work together along the same lines when it comes to containing violence at schools , speck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed police enter the gutenberg school in erfurt on april 26 , 2002 after a student ran amok and killed 18 people .
in future , uniformed officers are expected to be a regular feature in school corridors .
police officials will also conduct preventive classes in dealing with violence , which is already the case in some german states , including berlin . the new initiative also foresees every school having their own contact person in the next police station and vice versa .
they are expected to exchange information on potentially violent students .
" that means that when a violent incident takes place at a school the designated police officer arrives there as soon as possible .
that gives the message : when something untoward happens the police are there , " said speck . the close contact between schools and the cops is also meant to build trust , in particular among young foreign students who often have bad experiences with the police in their countries of origin . hurdles to overcome the concept already seems to be working in some places , such as the school in berlin where helge dietrich teaches .
" the police who come to our school , go into the classrooms and make it clear to the students what violence actually is , " said dietrich .
" they also familiarize the students with how they can deescalate violence . " despite the optimism surrounding the new initiative , cooperation between the police and schools is not expected to be all smooth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to the fact that many states are unable to fund such projects in the face of dwindling coffers , the police 's demand that all offenses at school be reported to them are also said to be unpopular among school directors worried that it might damage the reputation of their institutions . " actually every school director should be happy about such offers -lrb- of cooperation with the police -rrb- and one must be ready to learn that what is a deficit is n't necessarily a statement on how bad a school is , " said eckinger .
" instead , the director should say , ' we want to solve the problem ' . " that 's also a reason why the police suspect that the actual cases of violence at schools may be much higher than the statistics show , given that many simply go unreported . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de school violence trial begins in germany a whole german school class accused of torturing a fellow-student goes on trial tuesday .
the students , aged 16 to 18 , are accused of torturing a classmate over months and filming themselves doing so .
-lrb- may 25 , 2004 -rrb- german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed .

if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2005 fear in the schoolyard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just simple teasing schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .
teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . helge dietrich says that his students ' favorite expression is " son of a bitch . " a teacher at a high school in berlin 's mitte district and state chairman of the trade union for teachers -lrb- vde -rrb- , dietrich has been observing an increase in rowdy behavior at schools in berlin .
" it does n't take very long for verbal abuse to then turn into fisticuffs , " dietrich said . dietrich 's experience illustrates what his organization and the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- were trying to draw attention to at a meeting in berlin on monday : that violence in german schools is on the rise . schools helpless various studies support the claim .
statistics from berlin 's education department show that almost 19 percent of the 560 cases of school violence registered in 2003 - 04 took place on the way to school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , an investigation by the federal criminal office found that 5 percent of all students regularly engaged in violence ; a third occasionally indulged in fights .
a separate study by the weisser ring , an association for crime victims , found that every third student was too scared to cross the schoolyard during recess or even step on to the road leading to the school .
every second girl said she was frightened on the way to school and back home . " the quality of violence has increased and in a negative way , " said ludwig eckinger , vde national head .
" that means students are ready to hit more quickly even when their so-called victim is already injured .
we 're observing this aggressive behavior in all kinds of school and all over the country .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .

to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .

if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.02.2005 miserly eu states shamed by ngo report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's richest countries are failing africa 's poor , the report states twenty-one european union member states are tightwads when it comes to helping the world 's poorest countries , a report has revealed .
only four managed to meet the internationally agreed aid quota . in a report that names and shames some of the european union 's richest states , a number of non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- have accused the likes of germany and italy of keeping their purse strings tightened when it comes to helping the world 's poorest countries the report released on monday by action aid , eurodad and oxfam accuses europe 's misers in the wake of the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- meeting during which the world 's wealthiest nations pledged to rid the world 's poorest countries of their crippling debt but failed to meet africa 's demand for immediate action . the european relief agencies published a damning critique of member states ' efforts to address the issue , saying that g7 countries such as germany and italy did too little to meet a united nations target to reduce poverty in the world by 2015 . eu majority are " way off track " the combined data showed that only four eu states had fulfilled a promise made in 1970 by the world 's rich countries to give 0.7 percent of their gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- as foreign aid .
" the other 21 eu states are still a long way off track in terms of their promise ... this is inexcusable , " the report stated . those eu states that avoided the report 's scorn included luxembourg , which gives 0.8 percent of gni in aid , and sweden , which has also met the 0.7 percent target , saying these in particular deserved " gold stars " for their efforts .
the report also praised the netherlands for giving 0.81 percent , but said its gold star was at risk because the government wanted to count security-related expenditures as aid . even euro champ gets stingier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's " leading champion " was denmark , which currently pays the most of all eu states with 0.84 percent .
however , there were reservations in the report as to denmark 's future intentions as the danish government had been cutting down on aid spending since 2001 , when it gave 1.03 percent . " the eu must take positive action on three issues : improving the quantity and quality of international aid ; easing the burden of unsustainable debt ; and making the rules for world trade fairer , " the report stated . germany 's goal overly optimistic , says report singling out german chancellor gerhard schröder , the leader of the eu 's largest economy , for particular criticism , the report said that schröder 's promise at the world economic forum in davos that germany would reach the 0.7 percent goal in the " medium term " was optimistic at best .

not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2005 the german problem with corruption großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament dome is transparent , but that 's about it a widening match-fixing scandal and revelation of politicians ' corporate salaries have sullied germany 's once clean image .
experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .
" the perception that germany has no corruption problem has absolutely nothing to do with reality , but rather with the fact that a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light , " said uwe dolata , press spokesman for the trade union representing germany 's criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- . the berlin-based arm of transparency international , a corruption watchdog , defines corruption as " the misuse of public or private economic power for private use . "
according to economists , corruption in germany results in lower tax revenues and higher state spending , amounting to losses of some € 200 billion -lrb- $ 259 billion -rrb- yearly . half-hearted laws ? in the face of such figures , the pressure is on to find effective ways to tackle the issue .
according to corruption experts , germany is n't doing enough to address the problem and needs to amend its body of law on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for instance , the rules on bribing members of the german or state parliament are so narrowly formulated that not a single case has been punished so far , " said dolata of the bdk . the law , which dates from 1994 , penalizes the " buying of votes " but only for voting rounds held in the german parliament or bundestag .
" you need to expand that law and also make corruption in other panels where preliminary political decisions are taken punishable , " said dagmar schröder , head of the german chapter of transparency international . experts cite germany 's 1999 international bribery law that forbids german companies from bribing members of parliament abroad as another example of regulations that do n't go far enough . " that means that if a german businessman greases the palms of a member of parliament abroad , he can be punished , " said dolata .

experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .
" the perception that germany has no corruption problem has absolutely nothing to do with reality , but rather with the fact that a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light , " said uwe dolata , press spokesman for the trade union representing germany 's criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- . the berlin-based arm of transparency international , a corruption watchdog , defines corruption as " the misuse of public or private economic power for private use .

" you need to expand that law and also make corruption in other panels where preliminary political decisions are taken punishable , " said dagmar schröder , head of the german chapter of transparency international . experts cite germany 's 1999 international bribery law that forbids german companies from bribing members of parliament abroad as another example of regulations that do n't go far enough .

if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .

teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . helge dietrich says that his students ' favorite expression is " son of a bitch . " a teacher at a high school in berlin 's mitte district and state chairman of the trade union for teachers -lrb- vde -rrb- , dietrich has been observing an increase in rowdy behavior at schools in berlin .
" it does n't take very long for verbal abuse to then turn into fisticuffs , " dietrich said . dietrich 's experience illustrates what his organization and the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- were trying to draw attention to at a meeting in berlin on monday : that violence in german schools is on the rise . schools helpless various studies support the claim .
statistics from berlin 's education department show that almost 19 percent of the 560 cases of school violence registered in 2003 - 04 took place on the way to school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , an investigation by the federal criminal office found that 5 percent of all students regularly engaged in violence ; a third occasionally indulged in fights .
a separate study by the weisser ring , an association for crime victims , found that every third student was too scared to cross the schoolyard during recess or even step on to the road leading to the school .
every second girl said she was frightened on the way to school and back home . " the quality of violence has increased and in a negative way , " said ludwig eckinger , vde national head .
" that means students are ready to hit more quickly even when their so-called victim is already injured .
we 're observing this aggressive behavior in all kinds of school and all over the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aggressive behavior at school can take many forms - from bullying a fellow student , abusing him , jostling him , stealing his jacket or sneakers to actual physical injury .
most teachers and schools are said to be overwhelmed by the dimensions of the problem . closer links between schools and police to counter the growing menace , the vde and the dpolg unveiled a new initiative in berlin on monday which foresees an intensified cooperation between schools and the police . wolfgang speck , chairman of the dpolg pointed out that school teachers and police in germany have already been working together for decades when it comes to teaching traffic sense and regulations to students or providing them information on the dangers of drug abuse .
the two can now work together along the same lines when it comes to containing violence at schools , speck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed police enter the gutenberg school in erfurt on april 26 , 2002 after a student ran amok and killed 18 people .
in future , uniformed officers are expected to be a regular feature in school corridors .
police officials will also conduct preventive classes in dealing with violence , which is already the case in some german states , including berlin . the new initiative also foresees every school having their own contact person in the next police station and vice versa .
they are expected to exchange information on potentially violent students .
" that means that when a violent incident takes place at a school the designated police officer arrives there as soon as possible .
that gives the message : when something untoward happens the police are there , " said speck . the close contact between schools and the cops is also meant to build trust , in particular among young foreign students who often have bad experiences with the police in their countries of origin . hurdles to overcome the concept already seems to be working in some places , such as the school in berlin where helge dietrich teaches .
" the police who come to our school , go into the classrooms and make it clear to the students what violence actually is , " said dietrich .
" they also familiarize the students with how they can deescalate violence . " despite the optimism surrounding the new initiative , cooperation between the police and schools is not expected to be all smooth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to the fact that many states are unable to fund such projects in the face of dwindling coffers , the police 's demand that all offenses at school be reported to them are also said to be unpopular among school directors worried that it might damage the reputation of their institutions . " actually every school director should be happy about such offers -lrb- of cooperation with the police -rrb- and one must be ready to learn that what is a deficit is n't necessarily a statement on how bad a school is , " said eckinger .
" instead , the director should say , ' we want to solve the problem ' .

if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the rocky road to an eu constitution all eu hopes on spain a referendum for germany after all ? eu parliament approves constitution ratifying eu constitution will be a ' tough battle ' europe -pipe- 15.02.2005 putting the constitution to the test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referenda give european citizens an unusual amount of influence this friday in spain , the eu constitution faces the first of ten national referendums .
though it is expected to pass in spain , observers say it 's anything but a sure thing elsewhere . on april 15th , a copy of the european union constitution will hitch a ride with a russian rocket into space .
brussels apparently wants the extraterrestrial stunt to prove to the world that around half a billion europeans from 25 countries are all unitedly striving for " peace , freedom and prosperity . "
but , many europeans might wish the document just stayed there . discontent and general confusion regarding the document that aims to streamline bureaucracy in the 25-member bloc and chart the course europe will take in the future have made the constitution a difficult sell for european union leaders .
last week , french president jacques chirac and spanish prime minister josé luis rodríguez zapatero urged a gathering of about 2,000 spaniards to give the new document a chance . first of 10 the constitution “ has anchored freedom and democracy on the continent , ” said zapatero .
“ it will mean that war and dictatorship will disappear forever from europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution was put together by 150 delegates on feb .
20 , spain will be the first of 10 of the eu 's 25 member countries to put the constitution up to a referendum .
the populations of denmark , poland , the netherlands , portugal , ireland , luxembourg , the czech republic and , perhaps most importantly , france and great britain will follow in 2005 and 2006 .
opinion polls indicate that spain will approve the constitution .
but whether the other countries will follow is anyone ’ s guess . " it 's a national-driven process , which makes it quite challenging and unpredictable , " said sebastian kurpas , a constitution expert at the center for european policy studies in brussels . the document is the product of more than 16 months of work by a group of european parliamentarians , advisors and 150 other delegates , and was completed in july 2003 and blessed by eu leaders last november .
it establishes a permanent president of the european council , a body comprised of eu leaders , and combines what were two foreign representatives into one . what 's it all about ? the far left has rejected it as a global capitalist charter without adequate social protections , while the far right and nationalists have attacked it as a blueprint for a european " superstate " that would give too much power to brussels . the average european citizen , however , seems to have little idea what it 's all about .
a recent poll by the eu organization eurobarometer revealed that 33 percent of the eu citizens polled had never heard of the charter . " it 's a confusing and sometimes a contradictory document , " said kurpas .
" you are always in danger of getting stuck in details and missing the grand picture . " a european litmus test with euroskepticism on the rise , each national referendum will give brussels a good idea of how it stands with the voting country , and observers are worried domestic politicians will hijack the referendum for their own purposes .
in france , for example , social policy is likely to dominate the referendum .
in great britain , it 's likely to be immigration and asylum politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution is expected to face stiff opposition in britain .
these british european parliamentarians give a taste what 's to come . " even irrelevant issues can be become divisive in a referendum debate , " writes daniel keohane in a briefing paper published by the center for european reform in london .
" defense policy was paramount to the irish debate on the nice treaty in 2001 , even though the defense provision in that treaty did not affect ireland 's cherished policy of neutrality . " what does a " no " mean ? should one or more countries vote no on the constitution , one of three things can happen .
depending on the size and stature of the country in the union , the government will either put the constitution back to vote at a later date , send the document back to the drawing board or agree to back out of the constitution and re-negotiate its eu membership .
the latter is unlikely if , say , france were to say no . government leaders are working hard to keep something like that from happening by emphasizing the progress membership has brought to their countries . " in a country like spain , government is making a link to the big economic benefits that have come through europe that have modernized spain , " said kurpas .
the strategy gives people " a vision that europe is a benefit . " referenda as a democratic tool over the past two months , the spanish government spent € 7.5 million on an education campaign including spanish celebrities that seems to have had some effect .
a little over 51 percent of the population is in favor of a constitution , 10 percent more than before the campaign got underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spains prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero speaks at the opening of the european constitution campaign in madrid thursday night feb .
3 , 2005 in front of people holding signs reaing si -lrb- yes -rrb- .
one thing the referendums do is give european citizens an unusual amount of direct involvement in a major eu decision .
observers think more referendums might be a good way to increase awareness and involvement by europeans in the eu in the future .
" following so many referenda on the constitutional treaty , it will be difficult for governments not to put other kinds of eu issues to a public vote , " argued keohane .
he added that " in the future , it will be harder for critics to claim that the eu is inherently undemocratic .

if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .
traces of the militarily dubious decision to bomb the city remain visible today .
-lrb- feb .
13 , 2005 -rrb- the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .
the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation .

if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .
traces of the militarily dubious decision to bomb the city remain visible today .

in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .

in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

only four managed to meet the internationally agreed aid quota . in a report that names and shames some of the european union 's richest states , a number of non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- have accused the likes of germany and italy of keeping their purse strings tightened when it comes to helping the world 's poorest countries the report released on monday by action aid , eurodad and oxfam accuses europe 's misers in the wake of the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- meeting during which the world 's wealthiest nations pledged to rid the world 's poorest countries of their crippling debt but failed to meet africa 's demand for immediate action . the european relief agencies published a damning critique of member states ' efforts to address the issue , saying that g7 countries such as germany and italy did too little to meet a united nations target to reduce poverty in the world by 2015 . eu majority are " way off track " the combined data showed that only four eu states had fulfilled a promise made in 1970 by the world 's rich countries to give 0.7 percent of their gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- as foreign aid .
" the other 21 eu states are still a long way off track in terms of their promise ... this is inexcusable , " the report stated . those eu states that avoided the report 's scorn included luxembourg , which gives 0.8 percent of gni in aid , and sweden , which has also met the 0.7 percent target , saying these in particular deserved " gold stars " for their efforts .
the report also praised the netherlands for giving 0.81 percent , but said its gold star was at risk because the government wanted to count security-related expenditures as aid . even euro champ gets stingier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's " leading champion " was denmark , which currently pays the most of all eu states with 0.84 percent .
however , there were reservations in the report as to denmark 's future intentions as the danish government had been cutting down on aid spending since 2001 , when it gave 1.03 percent . " the eu must take positive action on three issues : improving the quantity and quality of international aid ; easing the burden of unsustainable debt ; and making the rules for world trade fairer , " the report stated . germany 's goal overly optimistic , says report singling out german chancellor gerhard schröder , the leader of the eu 's largest economy , for particular criticism , the report said that schröder 's promise at the world economic forum in davos that germany would reach the 0.7 percent goal in the " medium term " was optimistic at best .
" on current trends , germany will not reach the 0.7 percent until 2087 , which is a long way from being in the ' medium term ' , " the report said . italy also found itself in the firing line : " italy is one of the world 's wealthiest nations , yet it gives only a miserly 0.17 percent of its gni in aid . " g7 indecision compounds aid misery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministers of the group of seven major industrial countries .
despite the efforts of british finance minister gordon brown , who presented a plan for helping africa in what he called a " make or break year , " the g7 failed to agree on the proposals which would have freed up an extra € 38.4 billion -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- a year for poor countries and completely write off their debts . an agreement was eventually reached on the subject of debt relief but the increase in cash remained contentious . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.02.2005 germany debates the right of assembly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposals would ban npd rallies but would they infringe civil rights ?
in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .
while under existing law it is possible to ban gatherings that “ represent a danger for public security and order , ” the new measures could - at least in theory - permit a ban when there is “ no threat of a criminal violation of public security . ” restrictions on more than just far-right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will anti-war demonstrators come under the same restrictions as neo-nazis ?
in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .
while under existing law it is possible to ban gatherings that “ represent a danger for public security and order , ” the new measures could - at least in theory - permit a ban when there is “ no threat of a criminal violation of public security . ” restrictions on more than just far-right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will anti-war demonstrators come under the same restrictions as neo-nazis ?
in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . germans were clapping and laughing at the bombing of poland , russia and britain .
while the germans had the upper hand they were happy .
i have no sympathy for the people of dresden and any time i think about the kids under the bombs i think of my kids as slaves of the reich .
i do n't care if the war was nearly over .
i do n't care if there were no military targets .
dresden was our way of saying " if you think we are going to play nicely when you start a war , think again . " - darren smith the people who were responsible for the bombing of dresden should have been executed for war crimes . i find it horrid that whenever the subject is brought up , the reply is always that the nazis were to blame .
this trivializes the reality of the situation and attempts to justify evil .
there is no justification for the crime against humanity committed on the city of dresden .
it was nothing short of sadistic murder of defenceless civilians . it must never be forgotten . schröder shames germany by not standing up for those who died there and calling the act exactly what it was . he is the one trying to rewrite history . he is not worthy of leading germany . - john young i have seen the evidence of allied destruction in several of your cities in your beautiful country .
i do n't see why germany should be blamed for wwii .
the british still seem to be anti-german , after 60 years .
it 's time to forget the war .
move forward ! - paul hoare why should innocent people not be victims ?
to excuse the burning alive of germans just because they are germans is to subscribe to some perverse " collective guilt " thesis .
the " hitler made me do it " is a cheap fig-leaf .
to murder children and civilians is a crime , period .
if we start making excuses in one case , our whole western reputation -lrb- already much doubted by non-western nations -rrb- will really go down the sewage drain .
the fdr administration promoted collective guilt during the war as a tool for its wartime objectives .
that germans adopt that collective guilt 60 years after the fact as their credo is simply " sick . " - thomas reimer the truth about dresden is that it was a deliberate attempt to kill as many germans as possible by roasting , and to destroy an exquisite city dear to the hearts of germans at the same time .
any number up to 400,000 were killed .
trying to gloss over it , especially by germans , will make it worse in the future . there is already the perception that the media and the politicos in the western part of germany are a sort of german type of carpetbaggers .
this perception could only be enhanced by your attempts at being even-handed about what was manifestly a criminal act . - mario formosa what was the real reason dresden was firebombed ? surely it was a non-military target , which questions the reason of it being firebombed at all by the allies . perhaps in a broader sense it was done to show the german people the might of the anglo-american allies and what they could do to germany . beyond that fact , there is no earthly reason why it should have been firebombed at all .
to honor those innocent victims who were roasted by war criminals of the anglo-american air forces , there should be a day that they hold their heads down in shame for their brutality . - kenneth t. tellis , mississauga , ontario , canada i studied in dresden in february 1989 .
i attended the commemorations of the 13th and 14th of february ; spoke to people who lived through the bombings and have read english and german versions of the bombings . i was also told that allied prisoners of war as well as forced laborers from central and eastern europe were in dresden during the bombings .
given the nature of the attack , i believe many more people died than is officially recognized . - s. rizzi , australia the bombing of dresden appears to me a redundant and retrograde action not only because of the catastrophic loss of life and the heartbreaking experience of those who survived , but because it fostered a powerful resentment against those immediately responsible and their successors - on both sides .
in a sense , germany brought upon itself all of the disasters it experienced in world war ii by way of retaliation .
the tragedy is that such acts constitute the essence of warfare : neither aggressor nor victim are immune - and in the long run , all are victims . - michael sharkey , armidale , nsw australia one can be horrified by the rise of the far-right , who attack immigrants as well as jews , and still condemn the bombing , which accomplished no military gain .
35,000-135,000 civilians reduced to ash ! ?
although of course i knew about the dresden bombing .
i had n't known this many people were killed .
for what ?
vengeance ? - ellen , usa the intellectual examination of the bombing of dresden can yield contradictory views . on one hand , the bombing was indeed a military strike against a nation considered to be hostile . like hiroshima and nagasaki , the bombing also served two postwar purposes : scare the soviets into stopping their forward momentum and preventing a major land grab with an extreme show of force , and make the point that if you start hostilities which involve the us and its allies , you will regret it .
on the other hand , to say that the bombing was a war crime is to place it into the arena of legal definition and not military strategy .
commemorating the horror that were concentration camps can be done at the same time as grieving the losses at dresden . these are not mutually exclusive ideas .
germany lost a great deal as a result of its country 's military and its sadness and regret should n't be limited to jews in concentration camps . there is nothing wrong with saying collectively that we -lrb- germans -rrb- are sad for the events of auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen , etc. while simultaneously asking that the atrocities committed by the allies at least be recognized , if even for historical accuracy . - mj claus thank you for posting this information .
i have lived with the mystery and questions surrounding world war ii and dresden my entire life and am grateful that there exists a more open attitude toward these events now . this open attitude helps me to find my place in the course of events since world war ii and the relations between the united states and germany ; in a larger sense , being a " baby boomer " born after the war 's end , a relative of one of the bomber pilots and a descendant of an engineer connected with the moon landing , it helps me find a place in the cosmos inhabited by humans . - gretchen trupiano compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering dresden sixty years ago sunday , allied bombers attacked dresden and the thousands of residents and refugees who lived there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.02.2005 germany debates the right of assembly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposals would ban npd rallies but would they infringe civil rights ?
in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .

in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .

experts say the country has been slow to tackle corruption and are calling for tougher laws . there was a time when germany was known as a country stubbornly resistant to corruption , where even the mere whiff of scandal or sleaze would spell the end of a public or political career . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german referee robert hoyzer at the center of a match-fixing scandal not anymore .
in recent months , the country has been rocked by allegations of soccer match-fixing and revelations of high-ranking politicians making money on the side by being on the payrolls of large companies .
the events have further tainted germany 's once squeaky-clean reputation , which was already dealt a blow in 1999 when a financing scandal involving the conservative christian democratic party came to light . now , experts say that germany 's problem with corruption may be worse than previously thought .
" the perception that germany has no corruption problem has absolutely nothing to do with reality , but rather with the fact that a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light , " said uwe dolata , press spokesman for the trade union representing germany 's criminal police -lrb- bdk -rrb- . the berlin-based arm of transparency international , a corruption watchdog , defines corruption as " the misuse of public or private economic power for private use . "
according to economists , corruption in germany results in lower tax revenues and higher state spending , amounting to losses of some € 200 billion -lrb- $ 259 billion -rrb- yearly . half-hearted laws ? in the face of such figures , the pressure is on to find effective ways to tackle the issue .
according to corruption experts , germany is n't doing enough to address the problem and needs to amend its body of law on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for instance , the rules on bribing members of the german or state parliament are so narrowly formulated that not a single case has been punished so far , " said dolata of the bdk . the law , which dates from 1994 , penalizes the " buying of votes " but only for voting rounds held in the german parliament or bundestag .
" you need to expand that law and also make corruption in other panels where preliminary political decisions are taken punishable , " said dagmar schröder , head of the german chapter of transparency international . experts cite germany 's 1999 international bribery law that forbids german companies from bribing members of parliament abroad as another example of regulations that do n't go far enough . " that means that if a german businessman greases the palms of a member of parliament abroad , he can be punished , " said dolata .
" but if he offers the same money to a german member of parliament , he ca n't be penalized . " taking pointers from scandinavia ? experts say that germany could pick up a few lessons in fighting corruption from scandinavian countries , who lead the way when it comes to battling fraud .
according to transparency international 's corruption index , finland is the least corrupt nation worldwide .
such a high ranking is linked to scandinavia 's dominating " culture of transparency , " said dagmar schröder and urged introducing a " glass member of parliament " concept for germany too , which would require politicians to publicly declare all their income . # b # a further area where germany has its work cut out is in the economic sector , which schröder said " is significantly more corrupt , in particular because the financial sums involved are so high .

" transparency international is thus urging a corporate criminal law modeled on the one practiced in switzerland , whereby companies are held accountable for corruption cases .
in addition , the watchdog wants corrupt companies to be barred from receiving public contracts . angela göpfert -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disgraced german referee arrested disgraced german soccer referee robert hoyzer , who has admitted accepting bribes to manipulate matches , was arrested by police on saturday amid fears that he would try to flee the country .

" why should we not welcome the use of technology ? " asked german rehhagel .
" it would allow things to be established straight away and we just need to get used to little breaks in our game .
that is the case in other sports . " the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has made an official request for fifa , soccer 's world governing body , to start using video coverage to observe officials and analyze incidents such as whether the ball crosses the goal-line .
the request was a response to the scandal in which berlin referee robert hoyzer recently admitting to fixing four matches for financial gain .
but oliver bierhoff , assistant coach of the german national team , said technology is not the answer to the problem .
" i think we should do without video evidence , " said bierhoff .
" the game needs to flow and it is difficult to say where you begin and end with the whole video coverage .
there will always be mistakes in football . "
fifa president sepp blatter expressed similar sentiments : " as long as i am fifa president there will not be video coverage . football is a game for the people .

in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .
while under existing law it is possible to ban gatherings that “ represent a danger for public security and order , ” the new measures could - at least in theory - permit a ban when there is “ no threat of a criminal violation of public security . ” restrictions on more than just far-right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will anti-war demonstrators come under the same restrictions as neo-nazis ?
in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.02.2005 germany debates the right of assembly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposals would ban npd rallies but would they infringe civil rights ?
in a move which would allow demonstrations by the far-right npd party to be banned , the german government intends to put forward amendments to the right of assembly for approval in parliament . after demonstrations by right-wing extremists marred the 60th anniversary commemorations of the dresden bombing on sunday , new calls for the tightening , and even in some cases the removal , of the right to assembly are beginning to ring out in the higher echelons of german politics . huge crowds gathered in berlin at the weekend to pay their respects to the many thousands who lost their lives in the firestorm that consumed dresden towards the end of world war ii , but as the world 's eyes turned to germany 's moment of reflection the view was sullied by a rally organized by the far-right national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- . such a public display of extremist sentiment at a time of remembrance has furiously stirred the debate in political circles over what action can be taken to curb the npd and its activities . moves to outlaw the party outright under the german constitution 's provision allowing neo-nazi parties to be banned by the federal constitution court were quashed in 2003 after the court refused to grant a main hearing in the case because the german government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places . attempted npd ban quashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supreme court the judges at the time accused the schröder administration of manipulating the unassailable principles of a constitutional democracy and reminded the government that one of the cornerstones of that democracy was that the majority should not be allowed to silence a minority . now , in the wake of the dresden demonstrations and the impending events marking sixty years since the end of world war ii on may 8 , brigitte zypries , the federal minister of justice , announced on monday that new measures aimed at stopping neo-nazis rallying at historically sensitive sites would be put to parliament for ratification .
" right-wing extremists must not be allowed to profit from any gaps in the law , " zypries told reporters . " the limits of freedom of expression are exceeded if the public order is endangered by people who play down the wrongs done to the victims of the holocaust or those committed under national socialism , " she added .
the npd plan to hold a rally at the brandenburg gate , not far from a new memorial to victims of the holocaust , on the anniversary of the war 's end . restrictions on nazi-related gatherings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,400 members of the right-extremist national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- carry posters showing the portrait of the npd party leader udo voigt during a demonstration in berlin .
the poster reads : " arguments instead of prohibition . "
the measures , which have to be approved by parliament , place new restrictions on the right of assembly if those rallies are seen to glorify adolf hitler 's regime or minimize the crimes committed by it .
they would outlaw such gatherings where commemoration ceremonies are taking place , in areas where memorials , in particular to the holocaust , are located , or near former concentrations camps . the measures present a quandary for the german government .
in an attempt to stem the swell of popularity for the neo-nazis , it is considering a move that was last initiated by adolf hitler himself after he was made chancellor in january 1933 . after the burning of the reichstag in february of that year , hitler suspended parts of the weimar constitution which included article 123 - the right of assembly .
the action gave reich president hindenburg the power to suspend " the fundamental rights if public safety and order are considerably disturbed or endangered . " conservative opposition calls for hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse .
while the current red-green coalition of social democrats and greens proposes specific changes to the right of assembly rather than a complete suspension , members of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party the christian social union have called for tighter restrictions than those proposed by zypries and interior minister otto schily .
president of the bundestag wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the measures on monday but called for a complete end to the right of assembly in the case of the npd . the social democrats and the greens are unlikely to go that far but there are still major concerns as to the repercussions of such changes .
while under existing law it is possible to ban gatherings that “ represent a danger for public security and order , ” the new measures could - at least in theory - permit a ban when there is “ no threat of a criminal violation of public security . ” restrictions on more than just far-right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will anti-war demonstrators come under the same restrictions as neo-nazis ?
in other words , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds for it to be banned .
in theory , this could mean that anti-war demonstrations , marches against the occupation of iraq or israeli incursions into the west bank could be outlawed . in addition , the proposed clause which would ban gatherings that “ take place at a location that commemorates in a clear manner the victims of an organised inhumane treatment and that is regarded as a national symbol for this treatment , and when the gathering is designed to condone , deny or play down this inhumane treatment of victims ” could be used against demonstrations demanding social equality and justice , such as opposition to the hartz iv reforms . ban would make berlin a no-go area the inclusion of location-based bans also represents its own set of problems .
if demonstrations could be banned in front of memorials or buildings of historical resonance , it would be possible to ban demonstrations in virtually all of berlin , a city with an abundance of such sites . in its efforts to combat the rise of the far-right , germany 's government could find itself in danger of curbing civil rights in a way national socialism 's founding fathers achieved over 70 years ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : neo-nazis cloud dresden commemorations dresdeners on sunday paid its respects on sunday to tens of thousands of people killed in the allied bombing 60 years ago , as far-right extremists rallied and marred the commemorations .

the move follows plans by the lake district national park authority to axe three centres to save money .
the authority said closing centres at seatoller , waterhead and pooley bridge would save it £ 40,000 .
but cumbria tourist board says it is concerned about the possible impact of any further closures .
the board has now called a special meeting to discuss the future of tourist information centres across the county .
cumbria has 33 tourist information centres -lrb- tics -rrb- , which are run by 13 different operators , such as district and councils .
ian stephens , deputy chief executive of cumbria tourist board , said : " tics are an important service for visitors and a source of bookings for many accommodation types and other businesses .
expected shortfall " cumbria tourist board has a duty to develop the tourism industry in cumbria and is currently developing long term plans to safeguard the important role tics play in the county 's economy . "
the tourist board does not operate any of the centres itself .
previous research by the tourist board has shown tics bring in more than £ 42m to the county every year from holiday bookings and tours .
figures from 2004 show that the county 's centres handled more than four million inquiries from visitors - 91 % of those in person .
last week the lake district national park authority revealed it was facing an expected shortfall of £ 667,000 over the next two years and a further £ 873,000 in 2007/8 .
the authority said it needed to " withdraw from some services " and streamline others .

the move follows plans by the lake district national park authority to axe three centres to save money .
the authority said closing centres at seatoller , waterhead and pooley bridge would save it £ 40,000 .

the board has now called a special meeting to discuss the future of tourist information centres across the county .
cumbria has 33 tourist information centres -lrb- tics -rrb- , which are run by 13 different operators , such as district and councils .

the tourist board does not operate any of the centres itself .
previous research by the tourist board has shown tics bring in more than £ 42m to the county every year from holiday bookings and tours .
figures from 2004 show that the county 's centres handled more than four million inquiries from visitors - 91 % of those in person .
last week the lake district national park authority revealed it was facing an expected shortfall of £ 667,000 over the next two years and a further £ 873,000 in 2007/8 .

kit hill , near callington , has been shaped by more than 5,000 years of human activity , but growing vegetation needs controlling , experts say .
the area features a neolithic long barrow dating back to about 3,000bc on its lower eastern slope , along with several bronze age barrows .
the 400-acre site is also an important habitat for wildlife , flora and fauna , much of which is protected by law .
there are also around 18 ancient burial mounds in the area , but the site needs cutting back and clearing of litter .
cornwall county council , which was given the site by the duchy of cornwall in 1985 , only has one full-time worker and one part-time worker to maintain it .
volunteers are taking part in an archaeology and conservation day on tuesday to assist in clearing up the site .
another archaeology and conservation day is being held on 5 march .

up to 25,000 10 and 11-year-olds will be taught how to administer mouth to mouth resuscitation and heart massage .
the abc for life programme aims to provide school children with basic life support skills .
each primary school will have one teacher trained in these skills who will pass on their knowledge to pupils .
the university said about 3,000 people suffer fatal heart attacks in northern ireland each year , but up to 1,800 lives could be saved if immediate basic life support was available to all of these people .
it said northern ireland has the highest incidence of heart disease in the world with about 8,000 people suffering a heart attack each year .
they now feel confident that they would know what to do if they found someone who had collapsed or lost consciousness headmaster wilson mcmullan dr david mccluskey , head of medicine and therapeutics at queen 's , said it was a unique scheme .
" it will educate an entire generation of primary seven children in one region of the united kingdom , " he said .
" already over one third of the primary schools in northern ireland have enrolled in the scheme and it is hoped that if all of the schools participate , up to 25,000 children each year would have the opportunity to learn these life-saving skills . "
awareness the three students behind the scheme are members of medsin , an independent , student organisation which raises awareness of global health issues .
headmaster wilson mcmullan said all year seven pupils at his school , ballydown primary school in banbridge , had been trained in basic life support .
" they now feel confident that they would know what to do if they found someone who had collapsed or lost consciousness , " he said .
andrew dougal of the northern ireland chest heart and stroke association welcomed the scheme .

it said northern ireland has the highest incidence of heart disease in the world with about 8,000 people suffering a heart attack each year . "
they now feel confident that they would know what to do if they found someone who had collapsed or lost consciousness " headmaster wilson mcmullan dr david mccluskey , head of medicine and therapeutics at queen 's , said it was a unique scheme .
" it will educate an entire generation of primary seven children in one region of the united kingdom , " he said .
" already over one third of the primary schools in northern ireland have enrolled in the scheme and it is hoped that if all of the schools participate , up to 25,000 children each year would have the opportunity to learn these life-saving skills . "
awareness the three students behind the scheme are members of medsin , an independent , student organisation which raises awareness of global health issues .
headmaster wilson mcmullan said all year seven pupils at his school , ballydown primary school in banbridge , had been trained in basic life support .
" they now feel confident that they would know what to do if they found someone who had collapsed or lost consciousness , " he said .
andrew dougal of the northern ireland chest heart and stroke association welcomed the scheme .
" we can not expect to depend solely on the ambulance service , " he said .
" particularly in rural areas , it will often be impossible for ambulances to reach a collapsed person within four minutes , and that is why lifesaving cpr -lrb- coronary pulmonary resuscitation -rrb- skills are so important . "
