program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.11.2005 nazi photo trips up confidence campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of a nazi rally in 1935 at the heart of the controversy the " du bist deutschland " media campaign was intended to inspire germans to feel positive about their country .
a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .
" we support the processing of german history and use this campaign to send an anti-fascist message that the achievements and personality of every single person in civil society is worthwhile . " " du bist deutschland is a message to everyone that every single one of us has a responsibility for the well-being and future of germany , " added cords . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

but the global commission on international migration presented a study in berlin this week that could work to ease public fears . in publishing the study , jan carlsson , co-chairman of the commission and former swedish development and migration minister , stressed the enormous economic importance of migrants .
without them , he said , many nations would no longer be able to maintain growth , as birth rates are declining and native populations ageing dramatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants cross into the us from mexico unfortunately , he said , despite these facts most governments have not yet formulated a coherent migration policy that would suit the interests of both natives and migrants . " the international community has not taken good care of the potential of people willing to move , willing to work for their own destiny and their families well being , and to make this into something fruitful for the countries of reception or the countries of origin , " carlsson said .
" you could say that it 's a failure .
there is no such thing as a coherent approach . " moderate migrant flows according to the study , the number of cross-border migrants has doubled in the past 25 years to some 200 million people . as a proportion of the world ’ s total population , migrant flows remain rather moderate , with just 3 percent of people on the move , the study showed . around 60 percent of all recorded migrants are now to be found in the world ’ s more prosperous nations ; the other 40 percent in developing regions , according to carlsson .
asia had the most migrants - currently 49 million people from around the globe have migrated there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth advocates migrant rights germany ’ s rita süssmuth , a former bundestag president and a major contributor to this country ’ s first migration law , urged people to see migration in a more positive light . migrants have often been among the most dynamic and entrepreneurial members of society , she said . in many developing countries , she added , financial contributions sent back home from migrants abroad constitute a more important source of income than all the official development assistance and foreign direct investment put together .
according to estimates , overall migrant remittances to family members back home is as high as $ 250 billion -lrb- 212 billion euros -rrb- a year . advocate for action of course , says süssmuth , this does not justify countries ' complacency on the matter .
“ the commission , too , is in favor of reducing forced migration by improving living and working conditions in the potential migrants ’ home countries , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants lined up to renew residence permits in greece " but migration on a voluntary basis should not be made more difficult by too many bureaucratic hurdles .
the international community will have to find a way of promoting voluntary migration based on full respect for human rights , clear regulations and fairness . ” the authors of the report urged governments around the world to pay more attention to migrants ’ full-scale social integration .
the better integration policies are geared to making migrants feel at home , the less policy-makers would have to be concerned about a direct link between international migration and cross-border terrorism . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror trial puts immigration office shortcomings in spotlight the judge who presided over a recent terrorism case has slammed germany 's immigration authority .

" phaeno officials said they hope the center will awaken a sleeping spirit of innovation and pique people 's interest in the sciences with its 250 hands-on experiments presented in the 9,000 square meter -lrb- 96,875 square foot -rrb- complex .

a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .
" we support the processing of german history and use this campaign to send an anti-fascist message that the achievements and personality of every single person in civil society is worthwhile . " " du bist deutschland is a message to everyone that every single one of us has a responsibility for the well-being and future of germany , " added cords . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2005 study highlights migration 's bright side großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asia has the most migrants among increasing fear of worldwide migration , a new study emphasizes migrants ' key role in fostering global economic growth . many europeans fear increasing worldwide migration , seeing it as a threat to job and lifestyle .
but the global commission on international migration presented a study in berlin this week that could work to ease public fears . in publishing the study , jan carlsson , co-chairman of the commission and former swedish development and migration minister , stressed the enormous economic importance of migrants .
without them , he said , many nations would no longer be able to maintain growth , as birth rates are declining and native populations ageing dramatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants cross into the us from mexico unfortunately , he said , despite these facts most governments have not yet formulated a coherent migration policy that would suit the interests of both natives and migrants . " the international community has not taken good care of the potential of people willing to move , willing to work for their own destiny and their families well being , and to make this into something fruitful for the countries of reception or the countries of origin , " carlsson said .
" you could say that it 's a failure .
there is no such thing as a coherent approach . " moderate migrant flows according to the study , the number of cross-border migrants has doubled in the past 25 years to some 200 million people . as a proportion of the world ’ s total population , migrant flows remain rather moderate , with just 3 percent of people on the move , the study showed . around 60 percent of all recorded migrants are now to be found in the world ’ s more prosperous nations ; the other 40 percent in developing regions , according to carlsson .
asia had the most migrants - currently 49 million people from around the globe have migrated there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth advocates migrant rights germany ’ s rita süssmuth , a former bundestag president and a major contributor to this country ’ s first migration law , urged people to see migration in a more positive light . migrants have often been among the most dynamic and entrepreneurial members of society , she said . in many developing countries , she added , financial contributions sent back home from migrants abroad constitute a more important source of income than all the official development assistance and foreign direct investment put together .
according to estimates , overall migrant remittances to family members back home is as high as $ 250 billion -lrb- 212 billion euros -rrb- a year . advocate for action of course , says süssmuth , this does not justify countries ' complacency on the matter .
“ the commission , too , is in favor of reducing forced migration by improving living and working conditions in the potential migrants ’ home countries , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants lined up to renew residence permits in greece " but migration on a voluntary basis should not be made more difficult by too many bureaucratic hurdles .
the international community will have to find a way of promoting voluntary migration based on full respect for human rights , clear regulations and fairness . ” the authors of the report urged governments around the world to pay more attention to migrants ’ full-scale social integration .
the better integration policies are geared to making migrants feel at home , the less policy-makers would have to be concerned about a direct link between international migration and cross-border terrorism . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror trial puts immigration office shortcomings in spotlight the judge who presided over a recent terrorism case has slammed germany 's immigration authority .

" phaeno officials said they hope the center will awaken a sleeping spirit of innovation and pique people 's interest in the sciences with its 250 hands-on experiments presented in the 9,000 square meter -lrb- 96,875 square foot -rrb- complex . " people are amazed and then start playing and asking questions , " peter rösner , one of the center 's experiment leaders told reporters . hands-on learning emphasized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rodeo circle is a first-hand momentum demonstration phaeno backers are hopeful that 180,000 people a year will decide to visit the center to , among other things , undergo a crash test with their own bodies , create ice at four degrees celsius -lrb- 39.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and see how tsunamis form in a wave tank .
the five-meter -lrb- 16.4-foot -rrb- flame that shoots into the air every 15 minutes is expected to be another crowd favorite .

" we want to make the natural sciences understandable in a hands-on way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a massive spring keeps students ' interest rösner added that the center would focus on answering visitors ' questions , not preaching science to people who are n't interested in it .
" no one is going to leave here with a degree in physics , " he said . the project , which began in 1999 , cost 79 million euros -lrb- $ 93 million -rrb- and is run by a foundation made up of the city of wolfsburg as well as a number of large german corporations , including volkswagen , enbw energie baden-württemberg and electronics company sennheiser . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exploring einstein 's laboratory an exhibition organized by the max planck institute in berlin pays tribute to the scientist 100 years after he published his theory of relativity and 50 years since his death .

but the global commission on international migration presented a study in berlin this week that could work to ease public fears . in publishing the study , jan carlsson , co-chairman of the commission and former swedish development and migration minister , stressed the enormous economic importance of migrants .

according to estimates , overall migrant remittances to family members back home is as high as $ 250 billion -lrb- 212 billion euros -rrb- a year . advocate for action of course , says süssmuth , this does not justify countries ' complacency on the matter .
“ the commission , too , is in favor of reducing forced migration by improving living and working conditions in the potential migrants ’ home countries , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants lined up to renew residence permits in greece " but migration on a voluntary basis should not be made more difficult by too many bureaucratic hurdles .
the international community will have to find a way of promoting voluntary migration based on full respect for human rights , clear regulations and fairness . ” the authors of the report urged governments around the world to pay more attention to migrants ’ full-scale social integration .

but both ducked questions on key issues following their first meeting . ahead of her thursday afternoon meeting with the british prime minister merkel , referred to the talks with blair as " an important building block " in the run-up to the eu council meeting scheduled for december . eu members are growing impatient for britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of next month , to put fresh proposals on the table for getting an agreement next month on the 2007-2013 budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair both blair and merkel danced around reporters ' questions on britain 's commitment to keeping its jealously-guarded rebate , which exempts it from having to pay into the eu budget .
the rebate was negotiated in 1985 at a time when britain was going through financial difficulties .
london 's commitment to holding on to the rebate has been one of the thorns in the side of eu negotiators leading up to the summit in barcelona on dec .
15 and 16 . " i want a success and if you want success you have to consider the sensitivities and the positions of every country .
if you forget the interests of a country you wo n't get far , " merkel told a news conference in blair 's downing street home .
budget rebate not " only issue " unlike european countries like france , merkel is not critical of the rebate and stresses that it is just one issue which needs to be looked at in order to clinch a budget deal .
" we need to address the concerns of everybody , net contributors and net beneficiaries .
it does n't just hinge on one issue , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier britain , which has promised to find an agreement next month , has said it will put its new proposals on the table before a dec .

germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , has already rejected any proposal that would increase germany 's eu spending . berlin at spending limit he said that berlin , the eu 's paymaster , is in the midst of its own austerity program and therefore has no further room to maneuver on the budget .
germany and other big contributors have long been arguing that the budget should be capped at one percent of gross national product .
voicing hope that the stalemate would soon be broken , steinmeier said the talks could get a boost if london put proposals on the table that are close to a package proposed in june by luxembourg , during its presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso an eu summit in june collapsed into a bitter exchange of accusations after britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden rejected the luxembourg proposal .
steinmeier says that germany and france will evaluate the british proposals together as soon as they are on the table . raising the pressure on britain , european commission head jose manuel barroso has also urged london to rapidly make its proposals for ending the budget standoff .
" i see a real risk if we do n't get this agreement during the british presidency , " he told reporters . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a clear signal for germany angela merkel is germany 's new chancellor and the first woman to get the job .

a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .
" we support the processing of german history and use this campaign to send an anti-fascist message that the achievements and personality of every single person in civil society is worthwhile .

a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .
" we support the processing of german history and use this campaign to send an anti-fascist message that the achievements and personality of every single person in civil society is worthwhile .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.11.2005 nazi photo trips up confidence campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of a nazi rally in 1935 at the heart of the controversy the " du bist deutschland " media campaign was intended to inspire germans to feel positive about their country .
a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .
" we support the processing of german history and use this campaign to send an anti-fascist message that the achievements and personality of every single person in civil society is worthwhile . " " du bist deutschland is a message to everyone that every single one of us has a responsibility for the well-being and future of germany , " added cords . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2005 study highlights migration 's bright side großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asia has the most migrants among increasing fear of worldwide migration , a new study emphasizes migrants ' key role in fostering global economic growth . many europeans fear increasing worldwide migration , seeing it as a threat to job and lifestyle .
but the global commission on international migration presented a study in berlin this week that could work to ease public fears . in publishing the study , jan carlsson , co-chairman of the commission and former swedish development and migration minister , stressed the enormous economic importance of migrants .
without them , he said , many nations would no longer be able to maintain growth , as birth rates are declining and native populations ageing dramatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants cross into the us from mexico unfortunately , he said , despite these facts most governments have not yet formulated a coherent migration policy that would suit the interests of both natives and migrants . " the international community has not taken good care of the potential of people willing to move , willing to work for their own destiny and their families well being , and to make this into something fruitful for the countries of reception or the countries of origin , " carlsson said .
" you could say that it 's a failure .
there is no such thing as a coherent approach . " moderate migrant flows according to the study , the number of cross-border migrants has doubled in the past 25 years to some 200 million people . as a proportion of the world ’ s total population , migrant flows remain rather moderate , with just 3 percent of people on the move , the study showed . around 60 percent of all recorded migrants are now to be found in the world ’ s more prosperous nations ; the other 40 percent in developing regions , according to carlsson .
asia had the most migrants - currently 49 million people from around the globe have migrated there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth advocates migrant rights germany ’ s rita süssmuth , a former bundestag president and a major contributor to this country ’ s first migration law , urged people to see migration in a more positive light . migrants have often been among the most dynamic and entrepreneurial members of society , she said . in many developing countries , she added , financial contributions sent back home from migrants abroad constitute a more important source of income than all the official development assistance and foreign direct investment put together .
according to estimates , overall migrant remittances to family members back home is as high as $ 250 billion -lrb- 212 billion euros -rrb- a year . advocate for action of course , says süssmuth , this does not justify countries ' complacency on the matter .
“ the commission , too , is in favor of reducing forced migration by improving living and working conditions in the potential migrants ’ home countries , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants lined up to renew residence permits in greece " but migration on a voluntary basis should not be made more difficult by too many bureaucratic hurdles .
the international community will have to find a way of promoting voluntary migration based on full respect for human rights , clear regulations and fairness . ” the authors of the report urged governments around the world to pay more attention to migrants ’ full-scale social integration .
the better integration policies are geared to making migrants feel at home , the less policy-makers would have to be concerned about a direct link between international migration and cross-border terrorism . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror trial puts immigration office shortcomings in spotlight the judge who presided over a recent terrorism case has slammed germany 's immigration authority .

but the global commission on international migration presented a study in berlin this week that could work to ease public fears . in publishing the study , jan carlsson , co-chairman of the commission and former swedish development and migration minister , stressed the enormous economic importance of migrants .

according to estimates , overall migrant remittances to family members back home is as high as $ 250 billion -lrb- 212 billion euros -rrb- a year . advocate for action of course , says süssmuth , this does not justify countries ' complacency on the matter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.11.2005 nazi photo trips up confidence campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of a nazi rally in 1935 at the heart of the controversy the " du bist deutschland " media campaign was intended to inspire germans to feel positive about their country .
a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .
" we support the processing of german history and use this campaign to send an anti-fascist message that the achievements and personality of every single person in civil society is worthwhile . " " du bist deutschland is a message to everyone that every single one of us has a responsibility for the well-being and future of germany , " added cords . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .
but now leading german media organizations have launched a new initiative to help lift their spirits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.11.2005 nazi photo trips up confidence campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of a nazi rally in 1935 at the heart of the controversy the " du bist deutschland " media campaign was intended to inspire germans to feel positive about their country .
a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .
" we support the processing of german history and use this campaign to send an anti-fascist message that the achievements and personality of every single person in civil society is worthwhile . " " du bist deutschland is a message to everyone that every single one of us has a responsibility for the well-being and future of germany , " added cords . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.11.2005 nazi photo trips up confidence campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of a nazi rally in 1935 at the heart of the controversy the " du bist deutschland " media campaign was intended to inspire germans to feel positive about their country .
a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .
" we support the processing of german history and use this campaign to send an anti-fascist message that the achievements and personality of every single person in civil society is worthwhile . " " du bist deutschland is a message to everyone that every single one of us has a responsibility for the well-being and future of germany , " added cords . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

consumer advocates are now questioning the effectiveness of routine health controls . an agricultural ministry spokesperson said 11 from 16 tests showed the confiscated frozen meat , which included poultry , horse , pork and beef , was past its use-by date and spoiled .
the announcement came just days after another business in the same state was closed for allegedly selling chicken meat that had gone bad . the meat originated in the european union countries of germany , spain , and italy , as well as brazil .

but the global commission on international migration presented a study in berlin this week that could work to ease public fears . in publishing the study , jan carlsson , co-chairman of the commission and former swedish development and migration minister , stressed the enormous economic importance of migrants .
without them , he said , many nations would no longer be able to maintain growth , as birth rates are declining and native populations ageing dramatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants cross into the us from mexico unfortunately , he said , despite these facts most governments have not yet formulated a coherent migration policy that would suit the interests of both natives and migrants . " the international community has not taken good care of the potential of people willing to move , willing to work for their own destiny and their families well being , and to make this into something fruitful for the countries of reception or the countries of origin , " carlsson said .
" you could say that it 's a failure .
there is no such thing as a coherent approach . " moderate migrant flows according to the study , the number of cross-border migrants has doubled in the past 25 years to some 200 million people . as a proportion of the world ’ s total population , migrant flows remain rather moderate , with just 3 percent of people on the move , the study showed . around 60 percent of all recorded migrants are now to be found in the world ’ s more prosperous nations ; the other 40 percent in developing regions , according to carlsson .
asia had the most migrants - currently 49 million people from around the globe have migrated there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth advocates migrant rights germany ’ s rita süssmuth , a former bundestag president and a major contributor to this country ’ s first migration law , urged people to see migration in a more positive light . migrants have often been among the most dynamic and entrepreneurial members of society , she said . in many developing countries , she added , financial contributions sent back home from migrants abroad constitute a more important source of income than all the official development assistance and foreign direct investment put together .
according to estimates , overall migrant remittances to family members back home is as high as $ 250 billion -lrb- 212 billion euros -rrb- a year . advocate for action of course , says süssmuth , this does not justify countries ' complacency on the matter .
“ the commission , too , is in favor of reducing forced migration by improving living and working conditions in the potential migrants ’ home countries , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants lined up to renew residence permits in greece " but migration on a voluntary basis should not be made more difficult by too many bureaucratic hurdles .
the international community will have to find a way of promoting voluntary migration based on full respect for human rights , clear regulations and fairness . ” the authors of the report urged governments around the world to pay more attention to migrants ’ full-scale social integration .
the better integration policies are geared to making migrants feel at home , the less policy-makers would have to be concerned about a direct link between international migration and cross-border terrorism . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror trial puts immigration office shortcomings in spotlight the judge who presided over a recent terrorism case has slammed germany 's immigration authority .

consumer advocates are now questioning the effectiveness of routine health controls . an agricultural ministry spokesperson said 11 from 16 tests showed the confiscated frozen meat , which included poultry , horse , pork and beef , was past its use-by date and spoiled .
the announcement came just days after another business in the same state was closed for allegedly selling chicken meat that had gone bad . the meat originated in the european union countries of germany , spain , and italy , as well as brazil .
officials are continuing to trace onward sales , but said there was no evidence so far the meat had ended up on consumers ' plates . sixty tons of the meat was supplied by the wholesaler dorenz , which is already under scrutiny by the district attorney ’ s office in essen for allegedly selling spoiled goods .
the other thirty tons came from a firm in baden-württemberg . bad beef the scandal surrounding dorenz first came to light at the end of october , when a routine check found three tons of spoiled roast beef , which had been reportedly relabeled with a new expiration date .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.11.2005 nazi photo trips up confidence campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of a nazi rally in 1935 at the heart of the controversy the " du bist deutschland " media campaign was intended to inspire germans to feel positive about their country .
a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .
" we support the processing of german history and use this campaign to send an anti-fascist message that the achievements and personality of every single person in civil society is worthwhile . " " du bist deutschland is a message to everyone that every single one of us has a responsibility for the well-being and future of germany , " added cords . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .
" we support the processing of german history and use this campaign to send an anti-fascist message that the achievements and personality of every single person in civil society is worthwhile . " " du bist deutschland is a message to everyone that every single one of us has a responsibility for the well-being and future of germany , " added cords . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

the rebate was negotiated in 1985 at a time when britain was going through financial difficulties .
london 's commitment to holding on to the rebate has been one of the thorns in the side of eu negotiators leading up to the summit in barcelona on dec .

germany and other big contributors have long been arguing that the budget should be capped at one percent of gross national product .

but the global commission on international migration presented a study in berlin this week that could work to ease public fears . in publishing the study , jan carlsson , co-chairman of the commission and former swedish development and migration minister , stressed the enormous economic importance of migrants .

according to estimates , overall migrant remittances to family members back home is as high as $ 250 billion -lrb- 212 billion euros -rrb- a year . advocate for action of course , says süssmuth , this does not justify countries ' complacency on the matter .
“ the commission , too , is in favor of reducing forced migration by improving living and working conditions in the potential migrants ’ home countries , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants lined up to renew residence permits in greece " but migration on a voluntary basis should not be made more difficult by too many bureaucratic hurdles .
the international community will have to find a way of promoting voluntary migration based on full respect for human rights , clear regulations and fairness . ” the authors of the report urged governments around the world to pay more attention to migrants ’ full-scale social integration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.11.2005 nazi photo trips up confidence campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of a nazi rally in 1935 at the heart of the controversy the " du bist deutschland " media campaign was intended to inspire germans to feel positive about their country .
a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .

but the global commission on international migration presented a study in berlin this week that could work to ease public fears . in publishing the study , jan carlsson , co-chairman of the commission and former swedish development and migration minister , stressed the enormous economic importance of migrants .
without them , he said , many nations would no longer be able to maintain growth , as birth rates are declining and native populations ageing dramatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants cross into the us from mexico unfortunately , he said , despite these facts most governments have not yet formulated a coherent migration policy that would suit the interests of both natives and migrants . " the international community has not taken good care of the potential of people willing to move , willing to work for their own destiny and their families well being , and to make this into something fruitful for the countries of reception or the countries of origin , " carlsson said .
" you could say that it 's a failure .
there is no such thing as a coherent approach . " moderate migrant flows according to the study , the number of cross-border migrants has doubled in the past 25 years to some 200 million people . as a proportion of the world ’ s total population , migrant flows remain rather moderate , with just 3 percent of people on the move , the study showed . around 60 percent of all recorded migrants are now to be found in the world ’ s more prosperous nations ; the other 40 percent in developing regions , according to carlsson .
asia had the most migrants - currently 49 million people from around the globe have migrated there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth advocates migrant rights germany ’ s rita süssmuth , a former bundestag president and a major contributor to this country ’ s first migration law , urged people to see migration in a more positive light . migrants have often been among the most dynamic and entrepreneurial members of society , she said . in many developing countries , she added , financial contributions sent back home from migrants abroad constitute a more important source of income than all the official development assistance and foreign direct investment put together .
according to estimates , overall migrant remittances to family members back home is as high as $ 250 billion -lrb- 212 billion euros -rrb- a year . advocate for action of course , says süssmuth , this does not justify countries ' complacency on the matter .
“ the commission , too , is in favor of reducing forced migration by improving living and working conditions in the potential migrants ’ home countries , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants lined up to renew residence permits in greece " but migration on a voluntary basis should not be made more difficult by too many bureaucratic hurdles .
the international community will have to find a way of promoting voluntary migration based on full respect for human rights , clear regulations and fairness . ” the authors of the report urged governments around the world to pay more attention to migrants ’ full-scale social integration .
the better integration policies are geared to making migrants feel at home , the less policy-makers would have to be concerned about a direct link between international migration and cross-border terrorism . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror trial puts immigration office shortcomings in spotlight the judge who presided over a recent terrorism case has slammed germany 's immigration authority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.11.2005 nazi photo trips up confidence campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of a nazi rally in 1935 at the heart of the controversy the " du bist deutschland " media campaign was intended to inspire germans to feel positive about their country .
a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .

consumer advocates are now questioning the effectiveness of routine health controls . an agricultural ministry spokesperson said 11 from 16 tests showed the confiscated frozen meat , which included poultry , horse , pork and beef , was past its use-by date and spoiled .
the announcement came just days after another business in the same state was closed for allegedly selling chicken meat that had gone bad . the meat originated in the european union countries of germany , spain , and italy , as well as brazil .
officials are continuing to trace onward sales , but said there was no evidence so far the meat had ended up on consumers ' plates . sixty tons of the meat was supplied by the wholesaler dorenz , which is already under scrutiny by the district attorney ’ s office in essen for allegedly selling spoiled goods .
the other thirty tons came from a firm in baden-württemberg . bad beef the scandal surrounding dorenz first came to light at the end of october , when a routine check found three tons of spoiled roast beef , which had been reportedly relabeled with a new expiration date .
officers on friday also confiscated nearly 60 tons of chicken that had passed its sell-by date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rotten chicken meat was found twice in one month authorities in the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , where dorenz is based , are in the process of investigating 100 refrigerated warehouses .
a spokesperson for the nrw consumer affairs ministry said on wednesday more than 40 warehouses had already been checked , and there were no further traces of rotten meat . nrw 's consumer affairs minister eckhard uhlenberg has announced a tightening of food controls across the state .
but he said that tests showed the spoiled meat posed no health risk . farmers ' critique the german farmers ’ federation has criticized public health officials for failing to properly monitor wholesalers .

“ it ’ s like car theft , ” he said .
“ even if -lrb- courts -rrb- pass down a hundred sentences , it still happens . ” matthias wolfschmidt from the consumer organization foodwatch said the latest meat scandal was just the tip of the iceberg .
in an interview with the consumer protection magazine guter rat , wolfschmidt said fraud in the meat industry was “ the order of the day . ” he said ordinary citizens rarely found out about it because officials kept the cases secret .
wolfschmidt pointed out that two recent meat scandals in bavaria and lower saxony were exposed by workers . “ if we had left it up to food controllers to uncover the cases , we probably wouldn ’ t have found out about it , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu reaches europe concerns over the spread of bird flu in europe continued to grow after a related form of the h5n1 virus was discovered in greece as consumers across europe begin losing their appetite for chicken .

but both ducked questions on key issues following their first meeting . ahead of her thursday afternoon meeting with the british prime minister merkel , referred to the talks with blair as " an important building block " in the run-up to the eu council meeting scheduled for december . eu members are growing impatient for britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of next month , to put fresh proposals on the table for getting an agreement next month on the 2007-2013 budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair both blair and merkel danced around reporters ' questions on britain 's commitment to keeping its jealously-guarded rebate , which exempts it from having to pay into the eu budget .
the rebate was negotiated in 1985 at a time when britain was going through financial difficulties .
london 's commitment to holding on to the rebate has been one of the thorns in the side of eu negotiators leading up to the summit in barcelona on dec .
15 and 16 . " i want a success and if you want success you have to consider the sensitivities and the positions of every country .
if you forget the interests of a country you wo n't get far , " merkel told a news conference in blair 's downing street home .
budget rebate not " only issue " unlike european countries like france , merkel is not critical of the rebate and stresses that it is just one issue which needs to be looked at in order to clinch a budget deal .
" we need to address the concerns of everybody , net contributors and net beneficiaries .
it does n't just hinge on one issue , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier britain , which has promised to find an agreement next month , has said it will put its new proposals on the table before a dec .

germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , has already rejected any proposal that would increase germany 's eu spending . berlin at spending limit he said that berlin , the eu 's paymaster , is in the midst of its own austerity program and therefore has no further room to maneuver on the budget .
germany and other big contributors have long been arguing that the budget should be capped at one percent of gross national product .
voicing hope that the stalemate would soon be broken , steinmeier said the talks could get a boost if london put proposals on the table that are close to a package proposed in june by luxembourg , during its presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso an eu summit in june collapsed into a bitter exchange of accusations after britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden rejected the luxembourg proposal .
steinmeier says that germany and france will evaluate the british proposals together as soon as they are on the table . raising the pressure on britain , european commission head jose manuel barroso has also urged london to rapidly make its proposals for ending the budget standoff .
" i see a real risk if we do n't get this agreement during the british presidency , " he told reporters . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a clear signal for germany angela merkel is germany 's new chancellor and the first woman to get the job .

but the global commission on international migration presented a study in berlin this week that could work to ease public fears . in publishing the study , jan carlsson , co-chairman of the commission and former swedish development and migration minister , stressed the enormous economic importance of migrants .
without them , he said , many nations would no longer be able to maintain growth , as birth rates are declining and native populations ageing dramatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants cross into the us from mexico unfortunately , he said , despite these facts most governments have not yet formulated a coherent migration policy that would suit the interests of both natives and migrants . " the international community has not taken good care of the potential of people willing to move , willing to work for their own destiny and their families well being , and to make this into something fruitful for the countries of reception or the countries of origin , " carlsson said .
" you could say that it 's a failure .
there is no such thing as a coherent approach . " moderate migrant flows according to the study , the number of cross-border migrants has doubled in the past 25 years to some 200 million people . as a proportion of the world ’ s total population , migrant flows remain rather moderate , with just 3 percent of people on the move , the study showed . around 60 percent of all recorded migrants are now to be found in the world ’ s more prosperous nations ; the other 40 percent in developing regions , according to carlsson .
asia had the most migrants - currently 49 million people from around the globe have migrated there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth advocates migrant rights germany ’ s rita süssmuth , a former bundestag president and a major contributor to this country ’ s first migration law , urged people to see migration in a more positive light . migrants have often been among the most dynamic and entrepreneurial members of society , she said . in many developing countries , she added , financial contributions sent back home from migrants abroad constitute a more important source of income than all the official development assistance and foreign direct investment put together .
according to estimates , overall migrant remittances to family members back home is as high as $ 250 billion -lrb- 212 billion euros -rrb- a year . advocate for action of course , says süssmuth , this does not justify countries ' complacency on the matter .
“ the commission , too , is in favor of reducing forced migration by improving living and working conditions in the potential migrants ’ home countries , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants lined up to renew residence permits in greece " but migration on a voluntary basis should not be made more difficult by too many bureaucratic hurdles .
the international community will have to find a way of promoting voluntary migration based on full respect for human rights , clear regulations and fairness . ” the authors of the report urged governments around the world to pay more attention to migrants ’ full-scale social integration .
the better integration policies are geared to making migrants feel at home , the less policy-makers would have to be concerned about a direct link between international migration and cross-border terrorism . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror trial puts immigration office shortcomings in spotlight the judge who presided over a recent terrorism case has slammed germany 's immigration authority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.11.2005 nazi photo trips up confidence campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of a nazi rally in 1935 at the heart of the controversy the " du bist deutschland " media campaign was intended to inspire germans to feel positive about their country .
a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .
" we support the processing of german history and use this campaign to send an anti-fascist message that the achievements and personality of every single person in civil society is worthwhile . " " du bist deutschland is a message to everyone that every single one of us has a responsibility for the well-being and future of germany , " added cords . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .
" we support the processing of german history and use this campaign to send an anti-fascist message that the achievements and personality of every single person in civil society is worthwhile .

consumer advocates are now questioning the effectiveness of routine health controls . an agricultural ministry spokesperson said 11 from 16 tests showed the confiscated frozen meat , which included poultry , horse , pork and beef , was past its use-by date and spoiled .

but both ducked questions on key issues following their first meeting . ahead of her thursday afternoon meeting with the british prime minister merkel , referred to the talks with blair as " an important building block " in the run-up to the eu council meeting scheduled for december . eu members are growing impatient for britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of next month , to put fresh proposals on the table for getting an agreement next month on the 2007-2013 budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair both blair and merkel danced around reporters ' questions on britain 's commitment to keeping its jealously-guarded rebate , which exempts it from having to pay into the eu budget .
the rebate was negotiated in 1985 at a time when britain was going through financial difficulties .
london 's commitment to holding on to the rebate has been one of the thorns in the side of eu negotiators leading up to the summit in barcelona on dec .
15 and 16 . " i want a success and if you want success you have to consider the sensitivities and the positions of every country .
if you forget the interests of a country you wo n't get far , " merkel told a news conference in blair 's downing street home .
budget rebate not " only issue " unlike european countries like france , merkel is not critical of the rebate and stresses that it is just one issue which needs to be looked at in order to clinch a budget deal .
" we need to address the concerns of everybody , net contributors and net beneficiaries .
it does n't just hinge on one issue , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier britain , which has promised to find an agreement next month , has said it will put its new proposals on the table before a dec .
7 " conclave " of eu foreign ministers .
germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , has already rejected any proposal that would increase germany 's eu spending . berlin at spending limit he said that berlin , the eu 's paymaster , is in the midst of its own austerity program and therefore has no further room to maneuver on the budget .
germany and other big contributors have long been arguing that the budget should be capped at one percent of gross national product .
voicing hope that the stalemate would soon be broken , steinmeier said the talks could get a boost if london put proposals on the table that are close to a package proposed in june by luxembourg , during its presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso an eu summit in june collapsed into a bitter exchange of accusations after britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden rejected the luxembourg proposal .
steinmeier says that germany and france will evaluate the british proposals together as soon as they are on the table . raising the pressure on britain , european commission head jose manuel barroso has also urged london to rapidly make its proposals for ending the budget standoff .
" i see a real risk if we do n't get this agreement during the british presidency , " he told reporters . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a clear signal for germany angela merkel is germany 's new chancellor and the first woman to get the job .

but both ducked questions on key issues following their first meeting . ahead of her thursday afternoon meeting with the british prime minister merkel , referred to the talks with blair as " an important building block " in the run-up to the eu council meeting scheduled for december . eu members are growing impatient for britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of next month , to put fresh proposals on the table for getting an agreement next month on the 2007-2013 budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair both blair and merkel danced around reporters ' questions on britain 's commitment to keeping its jealously-guarded rebate , which exempts it from having to pay into the eu budget .
the rebate was negotiated in 1985 at a time when britain was going through financial difficulties .
london 's commitment to holding on to the rebate has been one of the thorns in the side of eu negotiators leading up to the summit in barcelona on dec .
15 and 16 . " i want a success and if you want success you have to consider the sensitivities and the positions of every country .
if you forget the interests of a country you wo n't get far , " merkel told a news conference in blair 's downing street home .
budget rebate not " only issue " unlike european countries like france , merkel is not critical of the rebate and stresses that it is just one issue which needs to be looked at in order to clinch a budget deal .
" we need to address the concerns of everybody , net contributors and net beneficiaries .
it does n't just hinge on one issue , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier britain , which has promised to find an agreement next month , has said it will put its new proposals on the table before a dec .
7 " conclave " of eu foreign ministers .
germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , has already rejected any proposal that would increase germany 's eu spending . berlin at spending limit he said that berlin , the eu 's paymaster , is in the midst of its own austerity program and therefore has no further room to maneuver on the budget .
germany and other big contributors have long been arguing that the budget should be capped at one percent of gross national product .
voicing hope that the stalemate would soon be broken , steinmeier said the talks could get a boost if london put proposals on the table that are close to a package proposed in june by luxembourg , during its presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso an eu summit in june collapsed into a bitter exchange of accusations after britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden rejected the luxembourg proposal .
steinmeier says that germany and france will evaluate the british proposals together as soon as they are on the table . raising the pressure on britain , european commission head jose manuel barroso has also urged london to rapidly make its proposals for ending the budget standoff .
" i see a real risk if we do n't get this agreement during the british presidency , " he told reporters . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a clear signal for germany angela merkel is germany 's new chancellor and the first woman to get the job .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.11.2005 nazi photo trips up confidence campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of a nazi rally in 1935 at the heart of the controversy the " du bist deutschland " media campaign was intended to inspire germans to feel positive about their country .
a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .
" we support the processing of german history and use this campaign to send an anti-fascist message that the achievements and personality of every single person in civil society is worthwhile . " " du bist deutschland is a message to everyone that every single one of us has a responsibility for the well-being and future of germany , " added cords . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.11.2005 nazi photo trips up confidence campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of a nazi rally in 1935 at the heart of the controversy the " du bist deutschland " media campaign was intended to inspire germans to feel positive about their country .
a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .
" we support the processing of german history and use this campaign to send an anti-fascist message that the achievements and personality of every single person in civil society is worthwhile . " " du bist deutschland is a message to everyone that every single one of us has a responsibility for the well-being and future of germany , " added cords . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .
but now leading german media organizations have launched a new initiative to help lift their spirits .

consumer advocates are now questioning the effectiveness of routine health controls . an agricultural ministry spokesperson said 11 from 16 tests showed the confiscated frozen meat , which included poultry , horse , pork and beef , was past its use-by date and spoiled .
the announcement came just days after another business in the same state was closed for allegedly selling chicken meat that had gone bad . the meat originated in the european union countries of germany , spain , and italy , as well as brazil .
officials are continuing to trace onward sales , but said there was no evidence so far the meat had ended up on consumers ' plates . sixty tons of the meat was supplied by the wholesaler dorenz , which is already under scrutiny by the district attorney ’ s office in essen for allegedly selling spoiled goods .
the other thirty tons came from a firm in baden-württemberg . bad beef the scandal surrounding dorenz first came to light at the end of october , when a routine check found three tons of spoiled roast beef , which had been reportedly relabeled with a new expiration date .

a spokesperson for the nrw consumer affairs ministry said on wednesday more than 40 warehouses had already been checked , and there were no further traces of rotten meat . nrw 's consumer affairs minister eckhard uhlenberg has announced a tightening of food controls across the state .
but he said that tests showed the spoiled meat posed no health risk . farmers ' critique the german farmers ’ federation has criticized public health officials for failing to properly monitor wholesalers .

“ it ’ s like car theft , ” he said .
“ even if -lrb- courts -rrb- pass down a hundred sentences , it still happens . ” matthias wolfschmidt from the consumer organization foodwatch said the latest meat scandal was just the tip of the iceberg .
in an interview with the consumer protection magazine guter rat , wolfschmidt said fraud in the meat industry was “ the order of the day . ” he said ordinary citizens rarely found out about it because officials kept the cases secret .
wolfschmidt pointed out that two recent meat scandals in bavaria and lower saxony were exposed by workers . “ if we had left it up to food controllers to uncover the cases , we probably wouldn ’ t have found out about it , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu reaches europe concerns over the spread of bird flu in europe continued to grow after a related form of the h5n1 virus was discovered in greece as consumers across europe begin losing their appetite for chicken .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.11.2005 nazi photo trips up confidence campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of a nazi rally in 1935 at the heart of the controversy the " du bist deutschland " media campaign was intended to inspire germans to feel positive about their country .
a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .
" we support the processing of german history and use this campaign to send an anti-fascist message that the achievements and personality of every single person in civil society is worthwhile . " " du bist deutschland is a message to everyone that every single one of us has a responsibility for the well-being and future of germany , " added cords . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

but the global commission on international migration presented a study in berlin this week that could work to ease public fears . in publishing the study , jan carlsson , co-chairman of the commission and former swedish development and migration minister , stressed the enormous economic importance of migrants .

" the international community has not taken good care of the potential of people willing to move , willing to work for their own destiny and their families well being , and to make this into something fruitful for the countries of reception or the countries of origin , " carlsson said .

according to estimates , overall migrant remittances to family members back home is as high as $ 250 billion -lrb- 212 billion euros -rrb- a year . advocate for action of course , says süssmuth , this does not justify countries ' complacency on the matter .
“ the commission , too , is in favor of reducing forced migration by improving living and working conditions in the potential migrants ’ home countries , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants lined up to renew residence permits in greece " but migration on a voluntary basis should not be made more difficult by too many bureaucratic hurdles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.11.2005 nazi photo trips up confidence campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of a nazi rally in 1935 at the heart of the controversy the " du bist deutschland " media campaign was intended to inspire germans to feel positive about their country .
a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .
" we support the processing of german history and use this campaign to send an anti-fascist message that the achievements and personality of every single person in civil society is worthwhile . " " du bist deutschland is a message to everyone that every single one of us has a responsibility for the well-being and future of germany , " added cords . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.11.2005 nazi photo trips up confidence campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of a nazi rally in 1935 at the heart of the controversy the " du bist deutschland " media campaign was intended to inspire germans to feel positive about their country .
a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .
" we support the processing of german history and use this campaign to send an anti-fascist message that the achievements and personality of every single person in civil society is worthwhile . " " du bist deutschland is a message to everyone that every single one of us has a responsibility for the well-being and future of germany , " added cords . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .
but now leading german media organizations have launched a new initiative to help lift their spirits .

" people are amazed and then start playing and asking questions , " peter rösner , one of the center 's experiment leaders told reporters . hands-on learning emphasized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rodeo circle is a first-hand momentum demonstration phaeno backers are hopeful that 180,000 people a year will decide to visit the center to , among other things , undergo a crash test with their own bodies , create ice at four degrees celsius -lrb- 39.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and see how tsunamis form in a wave tank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.11.2005 nazi photo trips up confidence campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of a nazi rally in 1935 at the heart of the controversy the " du bist deutschland " media campaign was intended to inspire germans to feel positive about their country .
a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces . it is the largest public-service campaign in german history , put together by 25 top media organizations on a budget of 30 million euros -lrb- $ 35.7 million -rrb- . last month the " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- campaign started its mission of trying to inject some optimism into a populace threatening to buckle under the weight of high unemployment , weak economic growth and a muddled political situation . but while the message plastered across the screens , pages and billboards of germany since the start of october promotes a sense of pride in what modern germany has achieved , a controversial photograph discovered in a book entitled " ludwigshafen - ein jahrhundert in bildern " -lrb- a century in pictures -rrb- suggests that the use of the slogan is not unique . the picture in question shows a public national socialist party convention from 1935 where a poster with the face of adolf hitler is suspended , supported by a long banner stretched between two groups of soldiers which bears the slogan : " denn du bist deutschland " -lrb- ' cause you are germany -rrb- in big bold letters . local historian digs up third reich photo the image allegedly comes from a selection of negatives discovered by ludwigshafen 's local historian and archivist stefan mörz , the author of the 1999 publication , from a collection left over from the time of the third reich .
the photo began appearing on internet sites earlier this week and sent the german blogging community into a spin before the mainstream media latched onto it . the authenticity of the photograph has been questioned and while it has been claimed that it is almost certainly the real thing , historians are continuing to research whether the national socialists actually used such a slogan at the time or ever in their history . ad company denies any fascist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the modern campaign uses well known success stories to promote pride .
if the photo is proven to be real , it would be an embarrassing discovery for hamburg 's jung von matt advertising agency , the creative force behind the current campaign , that the slogan being used to rally germany 's 82 million people to be proud of their country and to move on from the collective guilt and depression caused by aspects of their history was first used in some form by the nazis . erring on the side of caution , campaign coordinator lars christian cords issued a statement that suggested that the incident was a mere public relations blunder rather than a rekindling of fascist propaganda .
cords told the associated press that the campaign team knew nothing of the photograph . historians have also made it known that the slogan did not belong to the standard propaganda repertoire of the national socialists and is not a current nazi slogan . coordinator reiterates campaign message of unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's battered self-confidence does not need nazi reminders .
cords went further to stress that the campaign and all those involved with it condemns national socialism , racism and all neo-nazi beliefs .
" we support the processing of german history and use this campaign to send an anti-fascist message that the achievements and personality of every single person in civil society is worthwhile . " " du bist deutschland is a message to everyone that every single one of us has a responsibility for the well-being and future of germany , " added cords . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

but the global commission on international migration presented a study in berlin this week that could work to ease public fears . in publishing the study , jan carlsson , co-chairman of the commission and former swedish development and migration minister , stressed the enormous economic importance of migrants .
without them , he said , many nations would no longer be able to maintain growth , as birth rates are declining and native populations ageing dramatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants cross into the us from mexico unfortunately , he said , despite these facts most governments have not yet formulated a coherent migration policy that would suit the interests of both natives and migrants . " the international community has not taken good care of the potential of people willing to move , willing to work for their own destiny and their families well being , and to make this into something fruitful for the countries of reception or the countries of origin , " carlsson said .
" you could say that it 's a failure .
there is no such thing as a coherent approach . " moderate migrant flows according to the study , the number of cross-border migrants has doubled in the past 25 years to some 200 million people . as a proportion of the world ’ s total population , migrant flows remain rather moderate , with just 3 percent of people on the move , the study showed . around 60 percent of all recorded migrants are now to be found in the world ’ s more prosperous nations ; the other 40 percent in developing regions , according to carlsson .
asia had the most migrants - currently 49 million people from around the globe have migrated there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth advocates migrant rights germany ’ s rita süssmuth , a former bundestag president and a major contributor to this country ’ s first migration law , urged people to see migration in a more positive light . migrants have often been among the most dynamic and entrepreneurial members of society , she said . in many developing countries , she added , financial contributions sent back home from migrants abroad constitute a more important source of income than all the official development assistance and foreign direct investment put together .
according to estimates , overall migrant remittances to family members back home is as high as $ 250 billion -lrb- 212 billion euros -rrb- a year . advocate for action of course , says süssmuth , this does not justify countries ' complacency on the matter .
“ the commission , too , is in favor of reducing forced migration by improving living and working conditions in the potential migrants ’ home countries , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants lined up to renew residence permits in greece " but migration on a voluntary basis should not be made more difficult by too many bureaucratic hurdles .
the international community will have to find a way of promoting voluntary migration based on full respect for human rights , clear regulations and fairness . ” the authors of the report urged governments around the world to pay more attention to migrants ’ full-scale social integration .
the better integration policies are geared to making migrants feel at home , the less policy-makers would have to be concerned about a direct link between international migration and cross-border terrorism . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : terror trial puts immigration office shortcomings in spotlight the judge who presided over a recent terrorism case has slammed germany 's immigration authority .

a study in the nature journal says that being able to remember objects is more to do with focusing on relevant facts than having a large memory capacity .
university of oregon researchers say this ability to focus leaves more brain room to memorise pertinent information .
they also said that this suggests that scatter-brained people may find it harder to remember things .
but with their heads filled with more extraneous facts , it may well turn out that scatterbrains are in fact more creative .
university of oregon researchers asked volunteers to memorise red-coloured objects in a series of pictures and ignore everything else in the frame .
brain scans measured their ability to do this as carried out the memory task .
when tested afterwards , it was those that were best able to filter out irrelevant information that were able to remember more of the red-coloured objects .

the system can check for stolen vehicles , vehicles suspected of being used in a crime , disqualified drivers or individuals that are wanted on warrant .
if the scheme proves successful it will be extended to other areas within the avon and somerset police force area .
a spokesman said the system was a great tool that had already had a big impact across other parts of the country .

funders of the garden came in for criticism for failing to provide contingency plans when visitor numbers dropped .
the garden was bailed out by public money after being on the brink of closure in 2003 .
the auditor general said there was a " crisis " when visitors did not turn up .
in 2003 , the 500-acre garden at llanarthne in carmarthenshire , was on the brink of closure after the decline in visitor numbers and rising debts . "
i am no longer surprised by situations like this arising in the public sector - it is the same situation that arose over the millennium dome " jeremy coleman , auditor general for wales the garden , which cost more than £ 40m to set up , was a project to mark the new millennium .
but visitor numbers slumped after it was opened by prince charles in 2000 and the garden needed a £ 1.3m rescue package to remain in business .
welsh culture minister alun pugh initially rejected calls for a £ 3m assembly bail-out , but a three-party rescue deal was eventually struck between the assembly government , carmarthenshire council and the millennium commission .
but in his report into the financial management of the project , wales ' auditor general jeremy colman said : " there was no discussion of contingency plans and that would have thrown up the fact that there were n't any .
" so when the visitors did n't turn up there was a crisis . "
had that forward planning been done , said mr colman , then the public bodies funding the set up of the garden - namely the welsh assembly government , the wales tourist board and the wda - " might have deduced " that they would soon be asked for extra cash .
initially the garden attracted more visitors than predicted but in following years , numbers dropped to nearly half of that forecast forcing the management of the garden to look for further funding .
" i am no longer surprised by situations like this arising in the public sector .
it is the same situation that arose over the millennium dome , " said mr coleman .
" the assumption in the garden 's business plan - that it would not require ongoing public revenue support funding - was ambitious .
" most national botanic gardens receive some form of public funding . "
he also criticised funders for concentrating on their own contributions rather than looking at the overall picture " with the result that they had different information about which plan the garden was working to . "
mr coleman said they " were not fully and equally aware of the extent of the problems until the garden had reached crisis point " .

the bonuses will boost some government salaries by up to 50 % .
cuba 's communist party daily newspaper says that the pay rises will be the first some civil servants have been awarded in 23 years .
workers with masters degrees will receive a bonus of up to $ 4 a month .
doctors will get an extra $ 7 .
the raw figures might seem low but in cuba - where the average monthly salary is around $ 15 , and accommodation healthcare and education are free , the rises will be welcome .

in a speech last week he also blamed many of the country 's woes on what he described as cuba 's new rich - principally intermediaries and independent restaurant owners who have profited from this economy 's very limited opening up to private enterprise .
they , it appears , are being targeted in another move announced - a staggered price rise of up to three times for heavy consumers of electricity .

they had planned to drive around parliament square , in protest at proposed changes to laws governing cabs and the congestion charge .
but police have warned them they could face arrest , so now london cab drivers club is warning members not to show .
the new law was introduced in august , banning protests around westminster which do not have police permission .
demonstrators must seek police consent for any protest within half a mile of westminster under the serious and organised crime act .
it came as quite a bit of a shock alan fleming london cab drivers ' club the cabbies are annoyed about aspects of the transport for london bill 2005 , which includes changes to hackney carriage laws and to the scope of the congestion charge .
but they had not realised that by driving around parliament square four times in protest at 1300 gmt on thursday , without alerting police , they were breaking the law .
alan fleming , chairman of the london cab drivers ' club , said police had warned him that " any driver that goes there runs the risk of being arrested and a very big fine " .
" and also the organisers -lsb- could be fined -rsb- - it came as quite a bit of a shock , " he added .
he told the bbc news website they planned to organise another demonstration , with police permission , in january when the bill gets its first reading .
in a statement , charing cross police said : " should the organisation wish to hold a demonstration or procession police will work them with to facilitate this given appropriate notice . "
the new law was initially intended to remove brian haw , an anti-war protester who has camped in parliament square for four years .
but mr haw successfully fought off the latest attempt to evict him in the high court , by arguing his protest pre-dated the legislation .
