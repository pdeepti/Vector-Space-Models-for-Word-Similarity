but has the union of michael ballack and bayern munich run its course ?
the answer could come within days . bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge claimed this week that the club would not extend contract talks with german international michael ballack with both parties set for a showdown meeting within the next 10 days . ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far refused to sign the lucrative four-year extension put forward by bayern .

" ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united , inter milan and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client .

the increasing speculation surrounding ballack and the much-publicized links to some of the world 's top clubs is testament to how coveted the germany midfielder has become .
ballack 's stock has been rising steadily since he almost single-handedly dragged his largely unimpressive team mates to the world cup final in 2002 . world cup seaso n brought ballack i n to focus but he first caught the eye of european suitors after his display in 2002 champions league campaign when he led bayer leverkusen to the final , which they narrowly lost 2-1 to real madrid . ballack 's performances that year signaled to the world that there was a precocious talent in the ascendancy in germany - he was just 25 - and many clubs ran the rule over him as a possible midfield general to drive the heart of their teams . however , while most hesitated with the check book , bayern did n't and got to him first .

the answer could come within days . bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge claimed this week that the club would not extend contract talks with german international michael ballack with both parties set for a showdown meeting within the next 10 days . ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far refused to sign the lucrative four-year extension put forward by bayern . " we do not want this issue to drag on , " rummenigge told bild daily on thursday .
" michael ballack and his agent michael becker will meet with us in the middle of october and then he will inform us whether he accepts our offer or not . " ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united , inter milan and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client . " bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite missing the final , ballack 's preformances at the 2002 world cup helped his team make it .
the increasing speculation surrounding ballack and the much-publicized links to some of the world 's top clubs is testament to how coveted the germany midfielder has become .
ballack 's stock has been rising steadily since he almost single-handedly dragged his largely unimpressive team mates to the world cup final in 2002 . world cup seaso n brought ballack i n to focus but he first caught the eye of european suitors after his display in 2002 champions league campaign when he led bayer leverkusen to the final , which they narrowly lost 2-1 to real madrid . ballack 's performances that year signaled to the world that there was a precocious talent in the ascendancy in germany - he was just 25 - and many clubs ran the rule over him as a possible midfield general to drive the heart of their teams . however , while most hesitated with the check book , bayern did n't and got to him first .
ballack left the disappointment of an empty-handed season at leverkusen to sign for the munich giants for 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- after the world cup . it was a step-up that looked like it may never happen .

it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .
but has the union of michael ballack and bayern munich run its course ?
the answer could come within days . bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge claimed this week that the club would not extend contract talks with german international michael ballack with both parties set for a showdown meeting within the next 10 days . ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far refused to sign the lucrative four-year extension put forward by bayern . " we do not want this issue to drag on , " rummenigge told bild daily on thursday .
" michael ballack and his agent michael becker will meet with us in the middle of october and then he will inform us whether he accepts our offer or not . " ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united , inter milan and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client . " bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite missing the final , ballack 's preformances at the 2002 world cup helped his team make it .
the increasing speculation surrounding ballack and the much-publicized links to some of the world 's top clubs is testament to how coveted the germany midfielder has become .
ballack 's stock has been rising steadily since he almost single-handedly dragged his largely unimpressive team mates to the world cup final in 2002 . world cup seaso n brought ballack i n to focus but he first caught the eye of european suitors after his display in 2002 champions league campaign when he led bayer leverkusen to the final , which they narrowly lost 2-1 to real madrid . ballack 's performances that year signaled to the world that there was a precocious talent in the ascendancy in germany - he was just 25 - and many clubs ran the rule over him as a possible midfield general to drive the heart of their teams . however , while most hesitated with the check book , bayern did n't and got to him first .
ballack left the disappointment of an empty-handed season at leverkusen to sign for the munich giants for 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- after the world cup . it was a step-up that looked like it may never happen .
despite being a talented youngster at a handful of semi-professional east german clubs , it was only after his 1997 transfer from chemnitzer fc to kaiserslautern that ballack made it onto the big scene .
and even then it was a bittersweet affair . shy east germa n labeled " too soft " for bu n desliga although kaiserslautern were crowned champions of germany a year after he joined , ballack had played just a minor role .
he clashed with coach otto rehhagel and was labeled too soft and inconsistent for the bundesliga and moved on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he then joined leverkusen for 3.6 million euros in 1999 , demanding the no.13 shirt on his arrival , once the property of local hero rudi völler , " to provoke a little . "
then he got injured . things got worse when he went on to score an own goal that cost leverkusen the bundesliga title - he cried on the pitch afterwards - and at euro 2000 was granted only 63 minutes of play for the national team . cha n ge of positio n a n d attitude but a transformation then occurred .
a change of position from a holding role to attacking midfield brought the best out of ballack , a player comfortable with arriving late as support for the strikers and one capable of scoring goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another took place in his head .
ballack began to cultivate the supreme self-confidence that has led to many calling him arrogant .
a sports magazine ranked ballack third in a list of footballers most disliked by bundesliga players in a poll taken in 2002 with many stating his attitude behind their reasoning . coveted star despite " arroga n t " claims managers and coaches , however , loved the new ballack .
offers flew into the leverkusen office for " the little kaiser " - bayer 's general manager rainer calmund 's nick-name for ballack - from real madrid and barcelona in particular .
but the player who , with his straight-backed run and curly dark hair prompted comparisons with the young franz beckenbauer , was not ready to leave germany at that point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years , two bundesliga and german cup titles later and it may be a different story for michael ballack .
with manchester united looking for a long-term replacement for soon-to-be-departing midfield icon roy keane and real madrid in need of some steel in the center , ballack could be on his way out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how soon before ballack moves abroad ?
following a sterling confederations cup performance the rumor mill is hot with transfer talks concerning germany 's only real soccer star .
but will michael ballack jump ship abroad ?

" but the two-day visit may indeed be schröder 's last trip to russia as german leader as talks between the chancellor and his christian democratic rival angela merkel , whose party narrowly won more seats in parliamentary elections last month , approach an endgame that points to schröder 's resignation . but the german leader said it was still an open question what shape a coalition government between his social democrats and merkel 's christian democrats would take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel are still fighting for the chancellorship " the chances are high that our two parties will form a coalition government , but what will it look like ?
that is yet to be discussed , " he said , adding that he was " convinced that a high level of continuity would be ensured , whatever changes there are in germany . " foreig n mi n ister schröder ? schröder 's trip to russia was partially responsible for delaying a final decision on germany 's next government .
a final installment of talks between social democrats and christian democrats is now scheduled for 8 p.m. local time on sunday .
but the leaders have stressed that a decision may not be officially announced until monday , because they first want to inform their parties about the result . a poll by german public television ard released on friday showed that germans were getting increasingly weary of the standoff , with 41 percent wanting schröder to step down and 39 percent saying both he and merkel should go . the top-selling bild newspaper on friday meanwhile raised the possibility that schröder would drop down to vice-chancellor and foreign minister in a merkel-led administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder replace foreign minister joschka fischer ?
the chancellor angrily rejected such suggestions as a " personal insult , " according to a report in the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung .
but social democrat sources suggest that his own allies were not ruling it out . support from puti n schröder 's visit for putin 's birthday bash is the eighth meeting between the two leaders this year and follows the russian president 's trip for the german leader 's own 61st birthday in april . putin thanked the german leader for his visit , saying he appreciated it all the more considering the tense political climate in germany . " we know how difficult the situation is in germany and despite that you found the time to come here , " he said . sergei kazenov , from the global economics and international relations institute in moscow , said putin was demonstrating his support for schröder at a difficult time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin talking on friday " putin wants to support his friend gerhard after the election and show that he will not betray an old friendship , " he said .
" russo-german relations were given priority by moscow under schröder 's chancellorship .
and the russian president wants them to remain at the same level under a new german leadership . " friendly relations between schroeder and putin , who was a kgb agent in east germany in the late 1980s and speaks fluent german , have developed since the russian president came to power in 2000 and have enhanced putin 's image in russia as an international statesman . but they have proved controversial in germany , where opposition forces have attacked the chancellor for not being critical enough on human rights abuses , the chechen war and a high-profile investigation into former russian oil giant yukos . there are 3,000 german companies operating in russia and germany is russia 's largest trading partner , with a trade turnover of 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 36.3 billion -rrb- between the two in 2004 . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media play the waiting game the german media is on chancellor-watch as the nation wearily follows the negotiations to produce the country 's next leader .

it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .
but has the union of michael ballack and bayern munich run its course ?
the answer could come within days . bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge claimed this week that the club would not extend contract talks with german international michael ballack with both parties set for a showdown meeting within the next 10 days . ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far refused to sign the lucrative four-year extension put forward by bayern . " we do not want this issue to drag on , " rummenigge told bild daily on thursday .
" michael ballack and his agent michael becker will meet with us in the middle of october and then he will inform us whether he accepts our offer or not . " ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united , inter milan and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client . " bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite missing the final , ballack 's preformances at the 2002 world cup helped his team make it .
the increasing speculation surrounding ballack and the much-publicized links to some of the world 's top clubs is testament to how coveted the germany midfielder has become .
ballack 's stock has been rising steadily since he almost single-handedly dragged his largely unimpressive team mates to the world cup final in 2002 . world cup seaso n brought ballack i n to focus but he first caught the eye of european suitors after his display in 2002 champions league campaign when he led bayer leverkusen to the final , which they narrowly lost 2-1 to real madrid . ballack 's performances that year signaled to the world that there was a precocious talent in the ascendancy in germany - he was just 25 - and many clubs ran the rule over him as a possible midfield general to drive the heart of their teams . however , while most hesitated with the check book , bayern did n't and got to him first .
ballack left the disappointment of an empty-handed season at leverkusen to sign for the munich giants for 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- after the world cup . it was a step-up that looked like it may never happen .
despite being a talented youngster at a handful of semi-professional east german clubs , it was only after his 1997 transfer from chemnitzer fc to kaiserslautern that ballack made it onto the big scene .
and even then it was a bittersweet affair . shy east germa n labeled " too soft " for bu n desliga although kaiserslautern were crowned champions of germany a year after he joined , ballack had played just a minor role .
he clashed with coach otto rehhagel and was labeled too soft and inconsistent for the bundesliga and moved on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he then joined leverkusen for 3.6 million euros in 1999 , demanding the no.13 shirt on his arrival , once the property of local hero rudi völler , " to provoke a little . "
then he got injured . things got worse when he went on to score an own goal that cost leverkusen the bundesliga title - he cried on the pitch afterwards - and at euro 2000 was granted only 63 minutes of play for the national team . cha n ge of positio n a n d attitude but a transformation then occurred .
a change of position from a holding role to attacking midfield brought the best out of ballack , a player comfortable with arriving late as support for the strikers and one capable of scoring goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another took place in his head .
ballack began to cultivate the supreme self-confidence that has led to many calling him arrogant .
a sports magazine ranked ballack third in a list of footballers most disliked by bundesliga players in a poll taken in 2002 with many stating his attitude behind their reasoning . coveted star despite " arroga n t " claims managers and coaches , however , loved the new ballack .
offers flew into the leverkusen office for " the little kaiser " - bayer 's general manager rainer calmund 's nick-name for ballack - from real madrid and barcelona in particular .
but the player who , with his straight-backed run and curly dark hair prompted comparisons with the young franz beckenbauer , was not ready to leave germany at that point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years , two bundesliga and german cup titles later and it may be a different story for michael ballack .
with manchester united looking for a long-term replacement for soon-to-be-departing midfield icon roy keane and real madrid in need of some steel in the center , ballack could be on his way out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how soon before ballack moves abroad ?

it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .
but has the union of michael ballack and bayern munich run its course ?
the answer could come within days . bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge claimed this week that the club would not extend contract talks with german international michael ballack with both parties set for a showdown meeting within the next 10 days . ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far refused to sign the lucrative four-year extension put forward by bayern . " we do not want this issue to drag on , " rummenigge told bild daily on thursday .
" michael ballack and his agent michael becker will meet with us in the middle of october and then he will inform us whether he accepts our offer or not . " ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united , inter milan and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client . " bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite missing the final , ballack 's preformances at the 2002 world cup helped his team make it .
the increasing speculation surrounding ballack and the much-publicized links to some of the world 's top clubs is testament to how coveted the germany midfielder has become .
ballack 's stock has been rising steadily since he almost single-handedly dragged his largely unimpressive team mates to the world cup final in 2002 . world cup seaso n brought ballack i n to focus but he first caught the eye of european suitors after his display in 2002 champions league campaign when he led bayer leverkusen to the final , which they narrowly lost 2-1 to real madrid . ballack 's performances that year signaled to the world that there was a precocious talent in the ascendancy in germany - he was just 25 - and many clubs ran the rule over him as a possible midfield general to drive the heart of their teams . however , while most hesitated with the check book , bayern did n't and got to him first .
ballack left the disappointment of an empty-handed season at leverkusen to sign for the munich giants for 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- after the world cup . it was a step-up that looked like it may never happen .
despite being a talented youngster at a handful of semi-professional east german clubs , it was only after his 1997 transfer from chemnitzer fc to kaiserslautern that ballack made it onto the big scene .
and even then it was a bittersweet affair . shy east germa n labeled " too soft " for bu n desliga although kaiserslautern were crowned champions of germany a year after he joined , ballack had played just a minor role .
he clashed with coach otto rehhagel and was labeled too soft and inconsistent for the bundesliga and moved on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he then joined leverkusen for 3.6 million euros in 1999 , demanding the no.13 shirt on his arrival , once the property of local hero rudi völler , " to provoke a little . "
then he got injured . things got worse when he went on to score an own goal that cost leverkusen the bundesliga title - he cried on the pitch afterwards - and at euro 2000 was granted only 63 minutes of play for the national team . cha n ge of positio n a n d attitude but a transformation then occurred .
a change of position from a holding role to attacking midfield brought the best out of ballack , a player comfortable with arriving late as support for the strikers and one capable of scoring goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another took place in his head .
ballack began to cultivate the supreme self-confidence that has led to many calling him arrogant .
a sports magazine ranked ballack third in a list of footballers most disliked by bundesliga players in a poll taken in 2002 with many stating his attitude behind their reasoning . coveted star despite " arroga n t " claims managers and coaches , however , loved the new ballack .
offers flew into the leverkusen office for " the little kaiser " - bayer 's general manager rainer calmund 's nick-name for ballack - from real madrid and barcelona in particular .
but the player who , with his straight-backed run and curly dark hair prompted comparisons with the young franz beckenbauer , was not ready to leave germany at that point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years , two bundesliga and german cup titles later and it may be a different story for michael ballack .
with manchester united looking for a long-term replacement for soon-to-be-departing midfield icon roy keane and real madrid in need of some steel in the center , ballack could be on his way out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how soon before ballack moves abroad ?

it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .
but has the union of michael ballack and bayern munich run its course ?
the answer could come within days . bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge claimed this week that the club would not extend contract talks with german international michael ballack with both parties set for a showdown meeting within the next 10 days . ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far refused to sign the lucrative four-year extension put forward by bayern . " we do not want this issue to drag on , " rummenigge told bild daily on thursday .
" michael ballack and his agent michael becker will meet with us in the middle of october and then he will inform us whether he accepts our offer or not . " ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united , inter milan and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client . " bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite missing the final , ballack 's preformances at the 2002 world cup helped his team make it .
the increasing speculation surrounding ballack and the much-publicized links to some of the world 's top clubs is testament to how coveted the germany midfielder has become .
ballack 's stock has been rising steadily since he almost single-handedly dragged his largely unimpressive team mates to the world cup final in 2002 . world cup seaso n brought ballack i n to focus but he first caught the eye of european suitors after his display in 2002 champions league campaign when he led bayer leverkusen to the final , which they narrowly lost 2-1 to real madrid . ballack 's performances that year signaled to the world that there was a precocious talent in the ascendancy in germany - he was just 25 - and many clubs ran the rule over him as a possible midfield general to drive the heart of their teams . however , while most hesitated with the check book , bayern did n't and got to him first .
ballack left the disappointment of an empty-handed season at leverkusen to sign for the munich giants for 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- after the world cup . it was a step-up that looked like it may never happen .
despite being a talented youngster at a handful of semi-professional east german clubs , it was only after his 1997 transfer from chemnitzer fc to kaiserslautern that ballack made it onto the big scene .
and even then it was a bittersweet affair . shy east germa n labeled " too soft " for bu n desliga although kaiserslautern were crowned champions of germany a year after he joined , ballack had played just a minor role .
he clashed with coach otto rehhagel and was labeled too soft and inconsistent for the bundesliga and moved on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he then joined leverkusen for 3.6 million euros in 1999 , demanding the no.13 shirt on his arrival , once the property of local hero rudi völler , " to provoke a little . "
then he got injured . things got worse when he went on to score an own goal that cost leverkusen the bundesliga title - he cried on the pitch afterwards - and at euro 2000 was granted only 63 minutes of play for the national team . cha n ge of positio n a n d attitude but a transformation then occurred .
a change of position from a holding role to attacking midfield brought the best out of ballack , a player comfortable with arriving late as support for the strikers and one capable of scoring goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another took place in his head .
ballack began to cultivate the supreme self-confidence that has led to many calling him arrogant .
a sports magazine ranked ballack third in a list of footballers most disliked by bundesliga players in a poll taken in 2002 with many stating his attitude behind their reasoning . coveted star despite " arroga n t " claims managers and coaches , however , loved the new ballack .
offers flew into the leverkusen office for " the little kaiser " - bayer 's general manager rainer calmund 's nick-name for ballack - from real madrid and barcelona in particular .
but the player who , with his straight-backed run and curly dark hair prompted comparisons with the young franz beckenbauer , was not ready to leave germany at that point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years , two bundesliga and german cup titles later and it may be a different story for michael ballack .

" this is neither a farewell visit , nor my first visit has head of government , " he said after arriving for a two-day visit on friday .
" this is a visit of friendship . " but the two-day visit may indeed be schröder 's last trip to russia as german leader as talks between the chancellor and his christian democratic rival angela merkel , whose party narrowly won more seats in parliamentary elections last month , approach an endgame that points to schröder 's resignation . but the german leader said it was still an open question what shape a coalition government between his social democrats and merkel 's christian democrats would take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel are still fighting for the chancellorship " the chances are high that our two parties will form a coalition government , but what will it look like ?

it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .
but has the union of michael ballack and bayern munich run its course ?
the answer could come within days . bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge claimed this week that the club would not extend contract talks with german international michael ballack with both parties set for a showdown meeting within the next 10 days . ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far refused to sign the lucrative four-year extension put forward by bayern . " we do not want this issue to drag on , " rummenigge told bild daily on thursday .
" michael ballack and his agent michael becker will meet with us in the middle of october and then he will inform us whether he accepts our offer or not . " ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united , inter milan and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client . " bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite missing the final , ballack 's preformances at the 2002 world cup helped his team make it .
the increasing speculation surrounding ballack and the much-publicized links to some of the world 's top clubs is testament to how coveted the germany midfielder has become .
ballack 's stock has been rising steadily since he almost single-handedly dragged his largely unimpressive team mates to the world cup final in 2002 . world cup seaso n brought ballack i n to focus but he first caught the eye of european suitors after his display in 2002 champions league campaign when he led bayer leverkusen to the final , which they narrowly lost 2-1 to real madrid . ballack 's performances that year signaled to the world that there was a precocious talent in the ascendancy in germany - he was just 25 - and many clubs ran the rule over him as a possible midfield general to drive the heart of their teams . however , while most hesitated with the check book , bayern did n't and got to him first .
ballack left the disappointment of an empty-handed season at leverkusen to sign for the munich giants for 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- after the world cup . it was a step-up that looked like it may never happen .
despite being a talented youngster at a handful of semi-professional east german clubs , it was only after his 1997 transfer from chemnitzer fc to kaiserslautern that ballack made it onto the big scene .
and even then it was a bittersweet affair . shy east germa n labeled " too soft " for bu n desliga although kaiserslautern were crowned champions of germany a year after he joined , ballack had played just a minor role .
he clashed with coach otto rehhagel and was labeled too soft and inconsistent for the bundesliga and moved on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he then joined leverkusen for 3.6 million euros in 1999 , demanding the no.13 shirt on his arrival , once the property of local hero rudi völler , " to provoke a little . "
then he got injured . things got worse when he went on to score an own goal that cost leverkusen the bundesliga title - he cried on the pitch afterwards - and at euro 2000 was granted only 63 minutes of play for the national team . cha n ge of positio n a n d attitude but a transformation then occurred .
a change of position from a holding role to attacking midfield brought the best out of ballack , a player comfortable with arriving late as support for the strikers and one capable of scoring goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another took place in his head .
ballack began to cultivate the supreme self-confidence that has led to many calling him arrogant .
a sports magazine ranked ballack third in a list of footballers most disliked by bundesliga players in a poll taken in 2002 with many stating his attitude behind their reasoning . coveted star despite " arroga n t " claims managers and coaches , however , loved the new ballack .
offers flew into the leverkusen office for " the little kaiser " - bayer 's general manager rainer calmund 's nick-name for ballack - from real madrid and barcelona in particular .
but the player who , with his straight-backed run and curly dark hair prompted comparisons with the young franz beckenbauer , was not ready to leave germany at that point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years , two bundesliga and german cup titles later and it may be a different story for michael ballack .
with manchester united looking for a long-term replacement for soon-to-be-departing midfield icon roy keane and real madrid in need of some steel in the center , ballack could be on his way out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how soon before ballack moves abroad ?

" this is neither a farewell visit , nor my first visit has head of government , " he said after arriving for a two-day visit on friday .
" this is a visit of friendship . " but the two-day visit may indeed be schröder 's last trip to russia as german leader as talks between the chancellor and his christian democratic rival angela merkel , whose party narrowly won more seats in parliamentary elections last month , approach an endgame that points to schröder 's resignation . but the german leader said it was still an open question what shape a coalition government between his social democrats and merkel 's christian democrats would take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel are still fighting for the chancellorship " the chances are high that our two parties will form a coalition government , but what will it look like ?
that is yet to be discussed , " he said , adding that he was " convinced that a high level of continuity would be ensured , whatever changes there are in germany . " foreig n mi n ister schröder ? schröder 's trip to russia was partially responsible for delaying a final decision on germany 's next government .
a final installment of talks between social democrats and christian democrats is now scheduled for 8 p.m. local time on sunday .
but the leaders have stressed that a decision may not be officially announced until monday , because they first want to inform their parties about the result . a poll by german public television ard released on friday showed that germans were getting increasingly weary of the standoff , with 41 percent wanting schröder to step down and 39 percent saying both he and merkel should go . the top-selling bild newspaper on friday meanwhile raised the possibility that schröder would drop down to vice-chancellor and foreign minister in a merkel-led administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder replace foreign minister joschka fischer ?
the chancellor angrily rejected such suggestions as a " personal insult , " according to a report in the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung .
but social democrat sources suggest that his own allies were not ruling it out . support from puti n schröder 's visit for putin 's birthday bash is the eighth meeting between the two leaders this year and follows the russian president 's trip for the german leader 's own 61st birthday in april . putin thanked the german leader for his visit , saying he appreciated it all the more considering the tense political climate in germany . " we know how difficult the situation is in germany and despite that you found the time to come here , " he said . sergei kazenov , from the global economics and international relations institute in moscow , said putin was demonstrating his support for schröder at a difficult time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin talking on friday " putin wants to support his friend gerhard after the election and show that he will not betray an old friendship , " he said .
" russo-german relations were given priority by moscow under schröder 's chancellorship .
and the russian president wants them to remain at the same level under a new german leadership . " friendly relations between schroeder and putin , who was a kgb agent in east germany in the late 1980s and speaks fluent german , have developed since the russian president came to power in 2000 and have enhanced putin 's image in russia as an international statesman . but they have proved controversial in germany , where opposition forces have attacked the chancellor for not being critical enough on human rights abuses , the chechen war and a high-profile investigation into former russian oil giant yukos . there are 3,000 german companies operating in russia and germany is russia 's largest trading partner , with a trade turnover of 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 36.3 billion -rrb- between the two in 2004 . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media play the waiting game the german media is on chancellor-watch as the nation wearily follows the negotiations to produce the country 's next leader .

the answer could come within days . bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge claimed this week that the club would not extend contract talks with german international michael ballack with both parties set for a showdown meeting within the next 10 days . ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far refused to sign the lucrative four-year extension put forward by bayern . " we do not want this issue to drag on , " rummenigge told bild daily on thursday .
" michael ballack and his agent michael becker will meet with us in the middle of october and then he will inform us whether he accepts our offer or not . " ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united , inter milan and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client . " bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite missing the final , ballack 's preformances at the 2002 world cup helped his team make it .
the increasing speculation surrounding ballack and the much-publicized links to some of the world 's top clubs is testament to how coveted the germany midfielder has become .
ballack 's stock has been rising steadily since he almost single-handedly dragged his largely unimpressive team mates to the world cup final in 2002 . world cup seaso n brought ballack i n to focus but he first caught the eye of european suitors after his display in 2002 champions league campaign when he led bayer leverkusen to the final , which they narrowly lost 2-1 to real madrid . ballack 's performances that year signaled to the world that there was a precocious talent in the ascendancy in germany - he was just 25 - and many clubs ran the rule over him as a possible midfield general to drive the heart of their teams . however , while most hesitated with the check book , bayern did n't and got to him first .
ballack left the disappointment of an empty-handed season at leverkusen to sign for the munich giants for 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- after the world cup . it was a step-up that looked like it may never happen .
despite being a talented youngster at a handful of semi-professional east german clubs , it was only after his 1997 transfer from chemnitzer fc to kaiserslautern that ballack made it onto the big scene .
and even then it was a bittersweet affair . shy east germa n labeled " too soft " for bu n desliga although kaiserslautern were crowned champions of germany a year after he joined , ballack had played just a minor role .
he clashed with coach otto rehhagel and was labeled too soft and inconsistent for the bundesliga and moved on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he then joined leverkusen for 3.6 million euros in 1999 , demanding the no.13 shirt on his arrival , once the property of local hero rudi völler , " to provoke a little . "
then he got injured . things got worse when he went on to score an own goal that cost leverkusen the bundesliga title - he cried on the pitch afterwards - and at euro 2000 was granted only 63 minutes of play for the national team . cha n ge of positio n a n d attitude but a transformation then occurred .
a change of position from a holding role to attacking midfield brought the best out of ballack , a player comfortable with arriving late as support for the strikers and one capable of scoring goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another took place in his head .
ballack began to cultivate the supreme self-confidence that has led to many calling him arrogant .
a sports magazine ranked ballack third in a list of footballers most disliked by bundesliga players in a poll taken in 2002 with many stating his attitude behind their reasoning . coveted star despite " arroga n t " claims managers and coaches , however , loved the new ballack .
offers flew into the leverkusen office for " the little kaiser " - bayer 's general manager rainer calmund 's nick-name for ballack - from real madrid and barcelona in particular .
but the player who , with his straight-backed run and curly dark hair prompted comparisons with the young franz beckenbauer , was not ready to leave germany at that point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years , two bundesliga and german cup titles later and it may be a different story for michael ballack .
with manchester united looking for a long-term replacement for soon-to-be-departing midfield icon roy keane and real madrid in need of some steel in the center , ballack could be on his way out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how soon before ballack moves abroad ?

the increasing speculation surrounding ballack and the much-publicized links to some of the world 's top clubs is testament to how coveted the germany midfielder has become .
ballack 's stock has been rising steadily since he almost single-handedly dragged his largely unimpressive team mates to the world cup final in 2002 . world cup seaso n brought ballack i n to focus but he first caught the eye of european suitors after his display in 2002 champions league campaign when he led bayer leverkusen to the final , which they narrowly lost 2-1 to real madrid . ballack 's performances that year signaled to the world that there was a precocious talent in the ascendancy in germany - he was just 25 - and many clubs ran the rule over him as a possible midfield general to drive the heart of their teams . however , while most hesitated with the check book , bayern did n't and got to him first .

it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .
but has the union of michael ballack and bayern munich run its course ?
the answer could come within days . bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge claimed this week that the club would not extend contract talks with german international michael ballack with both parties set for a showdown meeting within the next 10 days . ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far refused to sign the lucrative four-year extension put forward by bayern . " we do not want this issue to drag on , " rummenigge told bild daily on thursday .
" michael ballack and his agent michael becker will meet with us in the middle of october and then he will inform us whether he accepts our offer or not . " ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united , inter milan and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client . " bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite missing the final , ballack 's preformances at the 2002 world cup helped his team make it .
the increasing speculation surrounding ballack and the much-publicized links to some of the world 's top clubs is testament to how coveted the germany midfielder has become .
ballack 's stock has been rising steadily since he almost single-handedly dragged his largely unimpressive team mates to the world cup final in 2002 . world cup seaso n brought ballack i n to focus but he first caught the eye of european suitors after his display in 2002 champions league campaign when he led bayer leverkusen to the final , which they narrowly lost 2-1 to real madrid . ballack 's performances that year signaled to the world that there was a precocious talent in the ascendancy in germany - he was just 25 - and many clubs ran the rule over him as a possible midfield general to drive the heart of their teams . however , while most hesitated with the check book , bayern did n't and got to him first .

it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .
but has the union of michael ballack and bayern munich run its course ?
the answer could come within days . bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge claimed this week that the club would not extend contract talks with german international michael ballack with both parties set for a showdown meeting within the next 10 days . ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far refused to sign the lucrative four-year extension put forward by bayern . " we do not want this issue to drag on , " rummenigge told bild daily on thursday .
" michael ballack and his agent michael becker will meet with us in the middle of october and then he will inform us whether he accepts our offer or not . " ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united , inter milan and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client . " bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite missing the final , ballack 's preformances at the 2002 world cup helped his team make it .
the increasing speculation surrounding ballack and the much-publicized links to some of the world 's top clubs is testament to how coveted the germany midfielder has become .
ballack 's stock has been rising steadily since he almost single-handedly dragged his largely unimpressive team mates to the world cup final in 2002 . world cup seaso n brought ballack i n to focus but he first caught the eye of european suitors after his display in 2002 champions league campaign when he led bayer leverkusen to the final , which they narrowly lost 2-1 to real madrid . ballack 's performances that year signaled to the world that there was a precocious talent in the ascendancy in germany - he was just 25 - and many clubs ran the rule over him as a possible midfield general to drive the heart of their teams . however , while most hesitated with the check book , bayern did n't and got to him first .
ballack left the disappointment of an empty-handed season at leverkusen to sign for the munich giants for 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- after the world cup . it was a step-up that looked like it may never happen .
despite being a talented youngster at a handful of semi-professional east german clubs , it was only after his 1997 transfer from chemnitzer fc to kaiserslautern that ballack made it onto the big scene .
and even then it was a bittersweet affair . shy east germa n labeled " too soft " for bu n desliga although kaiserslautern were crowned champions of germany a year after he joined , ballack had played just a minor role .
he clashed with coach otto rehhagel and was labeled too soft and inconsistent for the bundesliga and moved on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he then joined leverkusen for 3.6 million euros in 1999 , demanding the no.13 shirt on his arrival , once the property of local hero rudi völler , " to provoke a little . "
then he got injured . things got worse when he went on to score an own goal that cost leverkusen the bundesliga title - he cried on the pitch afterwards - and at euro 2000 was granted only 63 minutes of play for the national team . cha n ge of positio n a n d attitude but a transformation then occurred .
a change of position from a holding role to attacking midfield brought the best out of ballack , a player comfortable with arriving late as support for the strikers and one capable of scoring goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another took place in his head .
ballack began to cultivate the supreme self-confidence that has led to many calling him arrogant .
a sports magazine ranked ballack third in a list of footballers most disliked by bundesliga players in a poll taken in 2002 with many stating his attitude behind their reasoning . coveted star despite " arroga n t " claims managers and coaches , however , loved the new ballack .
offers flew into the leverkusen office for " the little kaiser " - bayer 's general manager rainer calmund 's nick-name for ballack - from real madrid and barcelona in particular .
but the player who , with his straight-backed run and curly dark hair prompted comparisons with the young franz beckenbauer , was not ready to leave germany at that point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years , two bundesliga and german cup titles later and it may be a different story for michael ballack .
with manchester united looking for a long-term replacement for soon-to-be-departing midfield icon roy keane and real madrid in need of some steel in the center , ballack could be on his way out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how soon before ballack moves abroad ?

" this is neither a farewell visit , nor my first visit has head of government , " he said after arriving for a two-day visit on friday .
" this is a visit of friendship . " but the two-day visit may indeed be schröder 's last trip to russia as german leader as talks between the chancellor and his christian democratic rival angela merkel , whose party narrowly won more seats in parliamentary elections last month , approach an endgame that points to schröder 's resignation . but the german leader said it was still an open question what shape a coalition government between his social democrats and merkel 's christian democrats would take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel are still fighting for the chancellorship " the chances are high that our two parties will form a coalition government , but what will it look like ?
that is yet to be discussed , " he said , adding that he was " convinced that a high level of continuity would be ensured , whatever changes there are in germany . " foreig n mi n ister schröder ? schröder 's trip to russia was partially responsible for delaying a final decision on germany 's next government .
a final installment of talks between social democrats and christian democrats is now scheduled for 8 p.m. local time on sunday .
but the leaders have stressed that a decision may not be officially announced until monday , because they first want to inform their parties about the result . a poll by german public television ard released on friday showed that germans were getting increasingly weary of the standoff , with 41 percent wanting schröder to step down and 39 percent saying both he and merkel should go . the top-selling bild newspaper on friday meanwhile raised the possibility that schröder would drop down to vice-chancellor and foreign minister in a merkel-led administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder replace foreign minister joschka fischer ?
the chancellor angrily rejected such suggestions as a " personal insult , " according to a report in the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung .
but social democrat sources suggest that his own allies were not ruling it out . support from puti n schröder 's visit for putin 's birthday bash is the eighth meeting between the two leaders this year and follows the russian president 's trip for the german leader 's own 61st birthday in april . putin thanked the german leader for his visit , saying he appreciated it all the more considering the tense political climate in germany . " we know how difficult the situation is in germany and despite that you found the time to come here , " he said . sergei kazenov , from the global economics and international relations institute in moscow , said putin was demonstrating his support for schröder at a difficult time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin talking on friday " putin wants to support his friend gerhard after the election and show that he will not betray an old friendship , " he said .
" russo-german relations were given priority by moscow under schröder 's chancellorship .
and the russian president wants them to remain at the same level under a new german leadership . " friendly relations between schroeder and putin , who was a kgb agent in east germany in the late 1980s and speaks fluent german , have developed since the russian president came to power in 2000 and have enhanced putin 's image in russia as an international statesman . but they have proved controversial in germany , where opposition forces have attacked the chancellor for not being critical enough on human rights abuses , the chechen war and a high-profile investigation into former russian oil giant yukos . there are 3,000 german companies operating in russia and germany is russia 's largest trading partner , with a trade turnover of 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 36.3 billion -rrb- between the two in 2004 . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media play the waiting game the german media is on chancellor-watch as the nation wearily follows the negotiations to produce the country 's next leader .

it 's crunch time in the race for germany 2006 and some countries are dragging themselves to the finish line . the world cup qualifiers , which could decide the fate of as many as 23 teams , began again on saturday .
ten countries , including germany - the hosts - and reigning world champions brazil are already guaranteed a starting place at the finals next summer . it was a bumper day of world cup action as nearly 40 matches took place all over the globe followed by another full round in europe , south america and concacaf , the north american and caribbean zone , next wednesday .
at the end of the nerve-wracking week , 27 of the 32 finalists should be known with the five outstanding berths to be filled in november 's play-offs . for some , the pressure is already off : italy , england , the netherlands and portugal qualified on saturday , along with paraguay , ecuador and costa rica in south america and togo , ghana , tunesia , angola and cote d 'ivoire in africa . for others , it will be a case of hope , prayer and mathematics with a number of teams needing a victory or the results of others to improve their own chances . host germa n y , ukrai n e o n ly euro qualifiers so far the final european tables are looking especially edgy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former world champions france , who shockingly went out in the first round in japan / korea in 2002 , looked to be heading for the ignominy of failing at the qualification stage this time round , but have dragged themselves to within sight of germany in the tightly-bunched group four .
but after a 1-1 draw with switzerland , they could still lose the space to the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's was also a nail-biting time for england in group six .
after looking to be coasting to at least a best runner-up spot and qualification for the finals , sven goran eriksson 's team had its world cup destiny in its own hands after a 1-0 defeat to northern ireland in belfast last month . but england beat austria at old trafford and qualified after the czech republic lost at home to the netherlands . south america a n d concacaf o n a k n ife edge bildunterschrift : away from europe , things were no less fraught .

it 's crunch time in the race for germany 2006 and some countries are dragging themselves to the finish line . the world cup qualifiers , which could decide the fate of as many as 23 teams , began again on saturday .
ten countries , including germany - the hosts - and reigning world champions brazil are already guaranteed a starting place at the finals next summer . it was a bumper day of world cup action as nearly 40 matches took place all over the globe followed by another full round in europe , south america and concacaf , the north american and caribbean zone , next wednesday .
at the end of the nerve-wracking week , 27 of the 32 finalists should be known with the five outstanding berths to be filled in november 's play-offs . for some , the pressure is already off : italy , england , the netherlands and portugal qualified on saturday , along with paraguay , ecuador and costa rica in south america and togo , ghana , tunesia , angola and cote d 'ivoire in africa . for others , it will be a case of hope , prayer and mathematics with a number of teams needing a victory or the results of others to improve their own chances . host germa n y , ukrai n e o n ly euro qualifiers so far the final european tables are looking especially edgy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former world champions france , who shockingly went out in the first round in japan / korea in 2002 , looked to be heading for the ignominy of failing at the qualification stage this time round , but have dragged themselves to within sight of germany in the tightly-bunched group four .
but after a 1-1 draw with switzerland , they could still lose the space to the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's was also a nail-biting time for england in group six .
after looking to be coasting to at least a best runner-up spot and qualification for the finals , sven goran eriksson 's team had its world cup destiny in its own hands after a 1-0 defeat to northern ireland in belfast last month . but england beat austria at old trafford and qualified after the czech republic lost at home to the netherlands . south america a n d concacaf o n a k n ife edge bildunterschrift : away from europe , things were no less fraught .
in the south american qualifiers , argentina and brazil already occupy two of the four automatic qualifying berths .
the remaining places could were filled by ecuador and paraguay on saturday . ecuador avoided defeat at home to uruguay to guarantee themselves a top four finish while paraguay won in venezuela . in the concacaf final group , costa rica qualified as third-placed finishers after beating the united states 3-0 .
the us have already booked their place in the finals . africa will k n ow it 's represe n tatives by su n day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while many of the zonal qualification places will be decided by wednesday night , the african qualifiers were all known by sunday morning as africa 's qualifying tournament ended at the weekend . on saturday , togo qualified for their first-ever world cup after beating congo 3-2 .
ghana also went through after avoiding defeat in the cape verde islands -lrb- 4-0 -rrb- , while angola qualified for the first time ever by beating rwanda 1-0 .
cote d 'ivoire is also in after beating sudan 3-1 as favorite cameroon tied 1-1 with egypt and will therefore not head to germany . tunisia are in their third successive finals after drawing 2-2 with morocco . dw staff -lrb- nda / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup qualifying heats up england have put themselves in an unenviable position .
in africa , the last day of world cup qualifiers will be both joyful and agonizing .

" this is neither a farewell visit , nor my first visit has head of government , " he said after arriving for a two-day visit on friday .
" this is a visit of friendship . " but the two-day visit may indeed be schröder 's last trip to russia as german leader as talks between the chancellor and his christian democratic rival angela merkel , whose party narrowly won more seats in parliamentary elections last month , approach an endgame that points to schröder 's resignation . but the german leader said it was still an open question what shape a coalition government between his social democrats and merkel 's christian democrats would take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel are still fighting for the chancellorship " the chances are high that our two parties will form a coalition government , but what will it look like ?
that is yet to be discussed , " he said , adding that he was " convinced that a high level of continuity would be ensured , whatever changes there are in germany . " foreig n mi n ister schröder ? schröder 's trip to russia was partially responsible for delaying a final decision on germany 's next government .
a final installment of talks between social democrats and christian democrats is now scheduled for 8 p.m. local time on sunday .
but the leaders have stressed that a decision may not be officially announced until monday , because they first want to inform their parties about the result . a poll by german public television ard released on friday showed that germans were getting increasingly weary of the standoff , with 41 percent wanting schröder to step down and 39 percent saying both he and merkel should go . the top-selling bild newspaper on friday meanwhile raised the possibility that schröder would drop down to vice-chancellor and foreign minister in a merkel-led administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder replace foreign minister joschka fischer ?
the chancellor angrily rejected such suggestions as a " personal insult , " according to a report in the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung .
but social democrat sources suggest that his own allies were not ruling it out . support from puti n schröder 's visit for putin 's birthday bash is the eighth meeting between the two leaders this year and follows the russian president 's trip for the german leader 's own 61st birthday in april . putin thanked the german leader for his visit , saying he appreciated it all the more considering the tense political climate in germany . " we know how difficult the situation is in germany and despite that you found the time to come here , " he said . sergei kazenov , from the global economics and international relations institute in moscow , said putin was demonstrating his support for schröder at a difficult time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin talking on friday " putin wants to support his friend gerhard after the election and show that he will not betray an old friendship , " he said .
" russo-german relations were given priority by moscow under schröder 's chancellorship .
and the russian president wants them to remain at the same level under a new german leadership . " friendly relations between schroeder and putin , who was a kgb agent in east germany in the late 1980s and speaks fluent german , have developed since the russian president came to power in 2000 and have enhanced putin 's image in russia as an international statesman . but they have proved controversial in germany , where opposition forces have attacked the chancellor for not being critical enough on human rights abuses , the chechen war and a high-profile investigation into former russian oil giant yukos . there are 3,000 german companies operating in russia and germany is russia 's largest trading partner , with a trade turnover of 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 36.3 billion -rrb- between the two in 2004 . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media play the waiting game the german media is on chancellor-watch as the nation wearily follows the negotiations to produce the country 's next leader .

it 's crunch time in the race for germany 2006 and some countries are dragging themselves to the finish line . the world cup qualifiers , which could decide the fate of as many as 23 teams , began again on saturday .
ten countries , including germany - the hosts - and reigning world champions brazil are already guaranteed a starting place at the finals next summer . it was a bumper day of world cup action as nearly 40 matches took place all over the globe followed by another full round in europe , south america and concacaf , the north american and caribbean zone , next wednesday .
at the end of the nerve-wracking week , 27 of the 32 finalists should be known with the five outstanding berths to be filled in november 's play-offs . for some , the pressure is already off : italy , england , the netherlands and portugal qualified on saturday , along with paraguay , ecuador and costa rica in south america and togo , ghana , tunesia , angola and cote d 'ivoire in africa . for others , it will be a case of hope , prayer and mathematics with a number of teams needing a victory or the results of others to improve their own chances . host germa n y , ukrai n e o n ly euro qualifiers so far the final european tables are looking especially edgy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former world champions france , who shockingly went out in the first round in japan / korea in 2002 , looked to be heading for the ignominy of failing at the qualification stage this time round , but have dragged themselves to within sight of germany in the tightly-bunched group four .
but after a 1-1 draw with switzerland , they could still lose the space to the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's was also a nail-biting time for england in group six .
after looking to be coasting to at least a best runner-up spot and qualification for the finals , sven goran eriksson 's team had its world cup destiny in its own hands after a 1-0 defeat to northern ireland in belfast last month . but england beat austria at old trafford and qualified after the czech republic lost at home to the netherlands . south america a n d concacaf o n a k n ife edge bildunterschrift : away from europe , things were no less fraught .
in the south american qualifiers , argentina and brazil already occupy two of the four automatic qualifying berths .
the remaining places could were filled by ecuador and paraguay on saturday . ecuador avoided defeat at home to uruguay to guarantee themselves a top four finish while paraguay won in venezuela . in the concacaf final group , costa rica qualified as third-placed finishers after beating the united states 3-0 .
the us have already booked their place in the finals . africa will k n ow it 's represe n tatives by su n day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while many of the zonal qualification places will be decided by wednesday night , the african qualifiers were all known by sunday morning as africa 's qualifying tournament ended at the weekend . on saturday , togo qualified for their first-ever world cup after beating congo 3-2 .
ghana also went through after avoiding defeat in the cape verde islands -lrb- 4-0 -rrb- , while angola qualified for the first time ever by beating rwanda 1-0 .
cote d 'ivoire is also in after beating sudan 3-1 as favorite cameroon tied 1-1 with egypt and will therefore not head to germany . tunisia are in their third successive finals after drawing 2-2 with morocco . dw staff -lrb- nda / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup qualifying heats up england have put themselves in an unenviable position .

it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .
but has the union of michael ballack and bayern munich run its course ?
the answer could come within days . bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge claimed this week that the club would not extend contract talks with german international michael ballack with both parties set for a showdown meeting within the next 10 days . ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far refused to sign the lucrative four-year extension put forward by bayern . " we do not want this issue to drag on , " rummenigge told bild daily on thursday .
" michael ballack and his agent michael becker will meet with us in the middle of october and then he will inform us whether he accepts our offer or not . " ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united , inter milan and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client . " bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite missing the final , ballack 's preformances at the 2002 world cup helped his team make it .
the increasing speculation surrounding ballack and the much-publicized links to some of the world 's top clubs is testament to how coveted the germany midfielder has become .
ballack 's stock has been rising steadily since he almost single-handedly dragged his largely unimpressive team mates to the world cup final in 2002 . world cup seaso n brought ballack i n to focus but he first caught the eye of european suitors after his display in 2002 champions league campaign when he led bayer leverkusen to the final , which they narrowly lost 2-1 to real madrid . ballack 's performances that year signaled to the world that there was a precocious talent in the ascendancy in germany - he was just 25 - and many clubs ran the rule over him as a possible midfield general to drive the heart of their teams . however , while most hesitated with the check book , bayern did n't and got to him first .
ballack left the disappointment of an empty-handed season at leverkusen to sign for the munich giants for 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- after the world cup . it was a step-up that looked like it may never happen .
despite being a talented youngster at a handful of semi-professional east german clubs , it was only after his 1997 transfer from chemnitzer fc to kaiserslautern that ballack made it onto the big scene .
and even then it was a bittersweet affair . shy east germa n labeled " too soft " for bu n desliga although kaiserslautern were crowned champions of germany a year after he joined , ballack had played just a minor role .
he clashed with coach otto rehhagel and was labeled too soft and inconsistent for the bundesliga and moved on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he then joined leverkusen for 3.6 million euros in 1999 , demanding the no.13 shirt on his arrival , once the property of local hero rudi völler , " to provoke a little . "
then he got injured . things got worse when he went on to score an own goal that cost leverkusen the bundesliga title - he cried on the pitch afterwards - and at euro 2000 was granted only 63 minutes of play for the national team . cha n ge of positio n a n d attitude but a transformation then occurred .
a change of position from a holding role to attacking midfield brought the best out of ballack , a player comfortable with arriving late as support for the strikers and one capable of scoring goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another took place in his head .
ballack began to cultivate the supreme self-confidence that has led to many calling him arrogant .
a sports magazine ranked ballack third in a list of footballers most disliked by bundesliga players in a poll taken in 2002 with many stating his attitude behind their reasoning . coveted star despite " arroga n t " claims managers and coaches , however , loved the new ballack .
offers flew into the leverkusen office for " the little kaiser " - bayer 's general manager rainer calmund 's nick-name for ballack - from real madrid and barcelona in particular .
but the player who , with his straight-backed run and curly dark hair prompted comparisons with the young franz beckenbauer , was not ready to leave germany at that point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years , two bundesliga and german cup titles later and it may be a different story for michael ballack .
with manchester united looking for a long-term replacement for soon-to-be-departing midfield icon roy keane and real madrid in need of some steel in the center , ballack could be on his way out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how soon before ballack moves abroad ?

" but the two-day visit may indeed be schröder 's last trip to russia as german leader as talks between the chancellor and his christian democratic rival angela merkel , whose party narrowly won more seats in parliamentary elections last month , approach an endgame that points to schröder 's resignation . but the german leader said it was still an open question what shape a coalition government between his social democrats and merkel 's christian democrats would take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel are still fighting for the chancellorship " the chances are high that our two parties will form a coalition government , but what will it look like ?
that is yet to be discussed , " he said , adding that he was " convinced that a high level of continuity would be ensured , whatever changes there are in germany . " foreig n mi n ister schröder ? schröder 's trip to russia was partially responsible for delaying a final decision on germany 's next government .
a final installment of talks between social democrats and christian democrats is now scheduled for 8 p.m. local time on sunday .
but the leaders have stressed that a decision may not be officially announced until monday , because they first want to inform their parties about the result . a poll by german public television ard released on friday showed that germans were getting increasingly weary of the standoff , with 41 percent wanting schröder to step down and 39 percent saying both he and merkel should go . the top-selling bild newspaper on friday meanwhile raised the possibility that schröder would drop down to vice-chancellor and foreign minister in a merkel-led administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder replace foreign minister joschka fischer ?
the chancellor angrily rejected such suggestions as a " personal insult , " according to a report in the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung .
but social democrat sources suggest that his own allies were not ruling it out . support from puti n schröder 's visit for putin 's birthday bash is the eighth meeting between the two leaders this year and follows the russian president 's trip for the german leader 's own 61st birthday in april . putin thanked the german leader for his visit , saying he appreciated it all the more considering the tense political climate in germany . " we know how difficult the situation is in germany and despite that you found the time to come here , " he said . sergei kazenov , from the global economics and international relations institute in moscow , said putin was demonstrating his support for schröder at a difficult time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin talking on friday " putin wants to support his friend gerhard after the election and show that he will not betray an old friendship , " he said .
" russo-german relations were given priority by moscow under schröder 's chancellorship .
and the russian president wants them to remain at the same level under a new german leadership . " friendly relations between schroeder and putin , who was a kgb agent in east germany in the late 1980s and speaks fluent german , have developed since the russian president came to power in 2000 and have enhanced putin 's image in russia as an international statesman . but they have proved controversial in germany , where opposition forces have attacked the chancellor for not being critical enough on human rights abuses , the chechen war and a high-profile investigation into former russian oil giant yukos . there are 3,000 german companies operating in russia and germany is russia 's largest trading partner , with a trade turnover of 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 36.3 billion -rrb- between the two in 2004 . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media play the waiting game the german media is on chancellor-watch as the nation wearily follows the negotiations to produce the country 's next leader .

while turkey have an eye on their final qualification matches , germany will also want to keep their momentum going . while the rest of the soccer world 's hopeful teams do battle for the right to take part in the world cup in germany next summer , the host nation will be keeping their own preparations going with a friendly match against turkey in istanbul on saturday . despite going into the turkey game , and the following practice match against china in hamburg on wednesday , without skipper and influential midfielder michael ballack , germany will be riding high on the back of some solid performances which saw them take third place in june 's confederations cup . the team that coach jürgen klinsmann puts out against the turks , however , will be a very different one from which he would like , prompting many observers to call his possible line-up ' plan b.

" this is neither a farewell visit , nor my first visit has head of government , " he said after arriving for a two-day visit on friday .
" this is a visit of friendship . " but the two-day visit may indeed be schröder 's last trip to russia as german leader as talks between the chancellor and his christian democratic rival angela merkel , whose party narrowly won more seats in parliamentary elections last month , approach an endgame that points to schröder 's resignation . but the german leader said it was still an open question what shape a coalition government between his social democrats and merkel 's christian democrats would take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel are still fighting for the chancellorship " the chances are high that our two parties will form a coalition government , but what will it look like ?
that is yet to be discussed , " he said , adding that he was " convinced that a high level of continuity would be ensured , whatever changes there are in germany . " foreig n mi n ister schröder ? schröder 's trip to russia was partially responsible for delaying a final decision on germany 's next government .
a final installment of talks between social democrats and christian democrats is now scheduled for 8 p.m. local time on sunday .
but the leaders have stressed that a decision may not be officially announced until monday , because they first want to inform their parties about the result . a poll by german public television ard released on friday showed that germans were getting increasingly weary of the standoff , with 41 percent wanting schröder to step down and 39 percent saying both he and merkel should go . the top-selling bild newspaper on friday meanwhile raised the possibility that schröder would drop down to vice-chancellor and foreign minister in a merkel-led administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder replace foreign minister joschka fischer ?
the chancellor angrily rejected such suggestions as a " personal insult , " according to a report in the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung .
but social democrat sources suggest that his own allies were not ruling it out . support from puti n schröder 's visit for putin 's birthday bash is the eighth meeting between the two leaders this year and follows the russian president 's trip for the german leader 's own 61st birthday in april . putin thanked the german leader for his visit , saying he appreciated it all the more considering the tense political climate in germany . " we know how difficult the situation is in germany and despite that you found the time to come here , " he said . sergei kazenov , from the global economics and international relations institute in moscow , said putin was demonstrating his support for schröder at a difficult time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin talking on friday " putin wants to support his friend gerhard after the election and show that he will not betray an old friendship , " he said .
" russo-german relations were given priority by moscow under schröder 's chancellorship .
and the russian president wants them to remain at the same level under a new german leadership . " friendly relations between schroeder and putin , who was a kgb agent in east germany in the late 1980s and speaks fluent german , have developed since the russian president came to power in 2000 and have enhanced putin 's image in russia as an international statesman . but they have proved controversial in germany , where opposition forces have attacked the chancellor for not being critical enough on human rights abuses , the chechen war and a high-profile investigation into former russian oil giant yukos . there are 3,000 german companies operating in russia and germany is russia 's largest trading partner , with a trade turnover of 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 36.3 billion -rrb- between the two in 2004 . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media play the waiting game the german media is on chancellor-watch as the nation wearily follows the negotiations to produce the country 's next leader .

the answer could come within days . bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge claimed this week that the club would not extend contract talks with german international michael ballack with both parties set for a showdown meeting within the next 10 days . ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far refused to sign the lucrative four-year extension put forward by bayern .

" michael ballack and his agent michael becker will meet with us in the middle of october and then he will inform us whether he accepts our offer or not . " ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united , inter milan and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client .

ballack left the disappointment of an empty-handed season at leverkusen to sign for the munich giants for 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- after the world cup . it was a step-up that looked like it may never happen .
despite being a talented youngster at a handful of semi-professional east german clubs , it was only after his 1997 transfer from chemnitzer fc to kaiserslautern that ballack made it onto the big scene .
and even then it was a bittersweet affair . shy east germa n labeled " too soft " for bu n desliga although kaiserslautern were crowned champions of germany a year after he joined , ballack had played just a minor role .

it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .
but has the union of michael ballack and bayern munich run its course ?
the answer could come within days . bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge claimed this week that the club would not extend contract talks with german international michael ballack with both parties set for a showdown meeting within the next 10 days . ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far refused to sign the lucrative four-year extension put forward by bayern . " we do not want this issue to drag on , " rummenigge told bild daily on thursday .
" michael ballack and his agent michael becker will meet with us in the middle of october and then he will inform us whether he accepts our offer or not . " ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united , inter milan and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client . " bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite missing the final , ballack 's preformances at the 2002 world cup helped his team make it .
the increasing speculation surrounding ballack and the much-publicized links to some of the world 's top clubs is testament to how coveted the germany midfielder has become .
ballack 's stock has been rising steadily since he almost single-handedly dragged his largely unimpressive team mates to the world cup final in 2002 . world cup seaso n brought ballack i n to focus but he first caught the eye of european suitors after his display in 2002 champions league campaign when he led bayer leverkusen to the final , which they narrowly lost 2-1 to real madrid . ballack 's performances that year signaled to the world that there was a precocious talent in the ascendancy in germany - he was just 25 - and many clubs ran the rule over him as a possible midfield general to drive the heart of their teams . however , while most hesitated with the check book , bayern did n't and got to him first .
ballack left the disappointment of an empty-handed season at leverkusen to sign for the munich giants for 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- after the world cup . it was a step-up that looked like it may never happen .
despite being a talented youngster at a handful of semi-professional east german clubs , it was only after his 1997 transfer from chemnitzer fc to kaiserslautern that ballack made it onto the big scene .
and even then it was a bittersweet affair . shy east germa n labeled " too soft " for bu n desliga although kaiserslautern were crowned champions of germany a year after he joined , ballack had played just a minor role .
he clashed with coach otto rehhagel and was labeled too soft and inconsistent for the bundesliga and moved on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he then joined leverkusen for 3.6 million euros in 1999 , demanding the no.13 shirt on his arrival , once the property of local hero rudi völler , " to provoke a little . "
then he got injured . things got worse when he went on to score an own goal that cost leverkusen the bundesliga title - he cried on the pitch afterwards - and at euro 2000 was granted only 63 minutes of play for the national team . cha n ge of positio n a n d attitude but a transformation then occurred .
a change of position from a holding role to attacking midfield brought the best out of ballack , a player comfortable with arriving late as support for the strikers and one capable of scoring goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another took place in his head .
ballack began to cultivate the supreme self-confidence that has led to many calling him arrogant .
a sports magazine ranked ballack third in a list of footballers most disliked by bundesliga players in a poll taken in 2002 with many stating his attitude behind their reasoning . coveted star despite " arroga n t " claims managers and coaches , however , loved the new ballack .

it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .
but has the union of michael ballack and bayern munich run its course ?
the answer could come within days . bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge claimed this week that the club would not extend contract talks with german international michael ballack with both parties set for a showdown meeting within the next 10 days . ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far refused to sign the lucrative four-year extension put forward by bayern . " we do not want this issue to drag on , " rummenigge told bild daily on thursday .
" michael ballack and his agent michael becker will meet with us in the middle of october and then he will inform us whether he accepts our offer or not . " ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united , inter milan and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client . " bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite missing the final , ballack 's preformances at the 2002 world cup helped his team make it .
the increasing speculation surrounding ballack and the much-publicized links to some of the world 's top clubs is testament to how coveted the germany midfielder has become .
ballack 's stock has been rising steadily since he almost single-handedly dragged his largely unimpressive team mates to the world cup final in 2002 . world cup seaso n brought ballack i n to focus but he first caught the eye of european suitors after his display in 2002 champions league campaign when he led bayer leverkusen to the final , which they narrowly lost 2-1 to real madrid . ballack 's performances that year signaled to the world that there was a precocious talent in the ascendancy in germany - he was just 25 - and many clubs ran the rule over him as a possible midfield general to drive the heart of their teams . however , while most hesitated with the check book , bayern did n't and got to him first .
ballack left the disappointment of an empty-handed season at leverkusen to sign for the munich giants for 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- after the world cup . it was a step-up that looked like it may never happen .
despite being a talented youngster at a handful of semi-professional east german clubs , it was only after his 1997 transfer from chemnitzer fc to kaiserslautern that ballack made it onto the big scene .
and even then it was a bittersweet affair . shy east germa n labeled " too soft " for bu n desliga although kaiserslautern were crowned champions of germany a year after he joined , ballack had played just a minor role .
he clashed with coach otto rehhagel and was labeled too soft and inconsistent for the bundesliga and moved on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he then joined leverkusen for 3.6 million euros in 1999 , demanding the no.13 shirt on his arrival , once the property of local hero rudi völler , " to provoke a little . "
then he got injured . things got worse when he went on to score an own goal that cost leverkusen the bundesliga title - he cried on the pitch afterwards - and at euro 2000 was granted only 63 minutes of play for the national team . cha n ge of positio n a n d attitude but a transformation then occurred .
a change of position from a holding role to attacking midfield brought the best out of ballack , a player comfortable with arriving late as support for the strikers and one capable of scoring goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another took place in his head .
ballack began to cultivate the supreme self-confidence that has led to many calling him arrogant .
a sports magazine ranked ballack third in a list of footballers most disliked by bundesliga players in a poll taken in 2002 with many stating his attitude behind their reasoning . coveted star despite " arroga n t " claims managers and coaches , however , loved the new ballack .
offers flew into the leverkusen office for " the little kaiser " - bayer 's general manager rainer calmund 's nick-name for ballack - from real madrid and barcelona in particular .
but the player who , with his straight-backed run and curly dark hair prompted comparisons with the young franz beckenbauer , was not ready to leave germany at that point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years , two bundesliga and german cup titles later and it may be a different story for michael ballack .

it 's crunch time in the race for germany 2006 and some countries are dragging themselves to the finish line . the world cup qualifiers , which could decide the fate of as many as 23 teams , began again on saturday .
ten countries , including germany - the hosts - and reigning world champions brazil are already guaranteed a starting place at the finals next summer . it was a bumper day of world cup action as nearly 40 matches took place all over the globe followed by another full round in europe , south america and concacaf , the north american and caribbean zone , next wednesday .
at the end of the nerve-wracking week , 27 of the 32 finalists should be known with the five outstanding berths to be filled in november 's play-offs . for some , the pressure is already off : italy , england , the netherlands and portugal qualified on saturday , along with paraguay , ecuador and costa rica in south america and togo , ghana , tunesia , angola and cote d 'ivoire in africa . for others , it will be a case of hope , prayer and mathematics with a number of teams needing a victory or the results of others to improve their own chances . host germa n y , ukrai n e o n ly euro qualifiers so far the final european tables are looking especially edgy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former world champions france , who shockingly went out in the first round in japan / korea in 2002 , looked to be heading for the ignominy of failing at the qualification stage this time round , but have dragged themselves to within sight of germany in the tightly-bunched group four .

it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .
but has the union of michael ballack and bayern munich run its course ?
the answer could come within days . bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge claimed this week that the club would not extend contract talks with german international michael ballack with both parties set for a showdown meeting within the next 10 days . ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far refused to sign the lucrative four-year extension put forward by bayern . " we do not want this issue to drag on , " rummenigge told bild daily on thursday .
" michael ballack and his agent michael becker will meet with us in the middle of october and then he will inform us whether he accepts our offer or not . " ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united , inter milan and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client . " bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite missing the final , ballack 's preformances at the 2002 world cup helped his team make it .
the increasing speculation surrounding ballack and the much-publicized links to some of the world 's top clubs is testament to how coveted the germany midfielder has become .
ballack 's stock has been rising steadily since he almost single-handedly dragged his largely unimpressive team mates to the world cup final in 2002 . world cup seaso n brought ballack i n to focus but he first caught the eye of european suitors after his display in 2002 champions league campaign when he led bayer leverkusen to the final , which they narrowly lost 2-1 to real madrid . ballack 's performances that year signaled to the world that there was a precocious talent in the ascendancy in germany - he was just 25 - and many clubs ran the rule over him as a possible midfield general to drive the heart of their teams . however , while most hesitated with the check book , bayern did n't and got to him first .
ballack left the disappointment of an empty-handed season at leverkusen to sign for the munich giants for 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- after the world cup . it was a step-up that looked like it may never happen .
despite being a talented youngster at a handful of semi-professional east german clubs , it was only after his 1997 transfer from chemnitzer fc to kaiserslautern that ballack made it onto the big scene .
and even then it was a bittersweet affair . shy east germa n labeled " too soft " for bu n desliga although kaiserslautern were crowned champions of germany a year after he joined , ballack had played just a minor role .
he clashed with coach otto rehhagel and was labeled too soft and inconsistent for the bundesliga and moved on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he then joined leverkusen for 3.6 million euros in 1999 , demanding the no.13 shirt on his arrival , once the property of local hero rudi völler , " to provoke a little . "
then he got injured . things got worse when he went on to score an own goal that cost leverkusen the bundesliga title - he cried on the pitch afterwards - and at euro 2000 was granted only 63 minutes of play for the national team . cha n ge of positio n a n d attitude but a transformation then occurred .
a change of position from a holding role to attacking midfield brought the best out of ballack , a player comfortable with arriving late as support for the strikers and one capable of scoring goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another took place in his head .
ballack began to cultivate the supreme self-confidence that has led to many calling him arrogant .
a sports magazine ranked ballack third in a list of footballers most disliked by bundesliga players in a poll taken in 2002 with many stating his attitude behind their reasoning . coveted star despite " arroga n t " claims managers and coaches , however , loved the new ballack .
offers flew into the leverkusen office for " the little kaiser " - bayer 's general manager rainer calmund 's nick-name for ballack - from real madrid and barcelona in particular .
but the player who , with his straight-backed run and curly dark hair prompted comparisons with the young franz beckenbauer , was not ready to leave germany at that point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years , two bundesliga and german cup titles later and it may be a different story for michael ballack .
with manchester united looking for a long-term replacement for soon-to-be-departing midfield icon roy keane and real madrid in need of some steel in the center , ballack could be on his way out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how soon before ballack moves abroad ?

" this is neither a farewell visit , nor my first visit has head of government , " he said after arriving for a two-day visit on friday .
" this is a visit of friendship . " but the two-day visit may indeed be schröder 's last trip to russia as german leader as talks between the chancellor and his christian democratic rival angela merkel , whose party narrowly won more seats in parliamentary elections last month , approach an endgame that points to schröder 's resignation . but the german leader said it was still an open question what shape a coalition government between his social democrats and merkel 's christian democrats would take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel are still fighting for the chancellorship " the chances are high that our two parties will form a coalition government , but what will it look like ?
that is yet to be discussed , " he said , adding that he was " convinced that a high level of continuity would be ensured , whatever changes there are in germany . " foreig n mi n ister schröder ? schröder 's trip to russia was partially responsible for delaying a final decision on germany 's next government .
a final installment of talks between social democrats and christian democrats is now scheduled for 8 p.m. local time on sunday .
but the leaders have stressed that a decision may not be officially announced until monday , because they first want to inform their parties about the result . a poll by german public television ard released on friday showed that germans were getting increasingly weary of the standoff , with 41 percent wanting schröder to step down and 39 percent saying both he and merkel should go . the top-selling bild newspaper on friday meanwhile raised the possibility that schröder would drop down to vice-chancellor and foreign minister in a merkel-led administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder replace foreign minister joschka fischer ?
the chancellor angrily rejected such suggestions as a " personal insult , " according to a report in the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung .
but social democrat sources suggest that his own allies were not ruling it out . support from puti n schröder 's visit for putin 's birthday bash is the eighth meeting between the two leaders this year and follows the russian president 's trip for the german leader 's own 61st birthday in april . putin thanked the german leader for his visit , saying he appreciated it all the more considering the tense political climate in germany . " we know how difficult the situation is in germany and despite that you found the time to come here , " he said . sergei kazenov , from the global economics and international relations institute in moscow , said putin was demonstrating his support for schröder at a difficult time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin talking on friday " putin wants to support his friend gerhard after the election and show that he will not betray an old friendship , " he said .
" russo-german relations were given priority by moscow under schröder 's chancellorship .
and the russian president wants them to remain at the same level under a new german leadership . " friendly relations between schroeder and putin , who was a kgb agent in east germany in the late 1980s and speaks fluent german , have developed since the russian president came to power in 2000 and have enhanced putin 's image in russia as an international statesman . but they have proved controversial in germany , where opposition forces have attacked the chancellor for not being critical enough on human rights abuses , the chechen war and a high-profile investigation into former russian oil giant yukos . there are 3,000 german companies operating in russia and germany is russia 's largest trading partner , with a trade turnover of 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 36.3 billion -rrb- between the two in 2004 . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media play the waiting game the german media is on chancellor-watch as the nation wearily follows the negotiations to produce the country 's next leader .

the answer could come within days . bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge claimed this week that the club would not extend contract talks with german international michael ballack with both parties set for a showdown meeting within the next 10 days . ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far refused to sign the lucrative four-year extension put forward by bayern . " we do not want this issue to drag on , " rummenigge told bild daily on thursday .
" michael ballack and his agent michael becker will meet with us in the middle of october and then he will inform us whether he accepts our offer or not . " ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united , inter milan and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client . " bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite missing the final , ballack 's preformances at the 2002 world cup helped his team make it .
the increasing speculation surrounding ballack and the much-publicized links to some of the world 's top clubs is testament to how coveted the germany midfielder has become .
ballack 's stock has been rising steadily since he almost single-handedly dragged his largely unimpressive team mates to the world cup final in 2002 . world cup seaso n brought ballack i n to focus but he first caught the eye of european suitors after his display in 2002 champions league campaign when he led bayer leverkusen to the final , which they narrowly lost 2-1 to real madrid . ballack 's performances that year signaled to the world that there was a precocious talent in the ascendancy in germany - he was just 25 - and many clubs ran the rule over him as a possible midfield general to drive the heart of their teams . however , while most hesitated with the check book , bayern did n't and got to him first .
ballack left the disappointment of an empty-handed season at leverkusen to sign for the munich giants for 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- after the world cup . it was a step-up that looked like it may never happen .
despite being a talented youngster at a handful of semi-professional east german clubs , it was only after his 1997 transfer from chemnitzer fc to kaiserslautern that ballack made it onto the big scene .
and even then it was a bittersweet affair . shy east germa n labeled " too soft " for bu n desliga although kaiserslautern were crowned champions of germany a year after he joined , ballack had played just a minor role .
he clashed with coach otto rehhagel and was labeled too soft and inconsistent for the bundesliga and moved on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he then joined leverkusen for 3.6 million euros in 1999 , demanding the no.13 shirt on his arrival , once the property of local hero rudi völler , " to provoke a little . "
then he got injured . things got worse when he went on to score an own goal that cost leverkusen the bundesliga title - he cried on the pitch afterwards - and at euro 2000 was granted only 63 minutes of play for the national team . cha n ge of positio n a n d attitude but a transformation then occurred .
a change of position from a holding role to attacking midfield brought the best out of ballack , a player comfortable with arriving late as support for the strikers and one capable of scoring goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another took place in his head .
ballack began to cultivate the supreme self-confidence that has led to many calling him arrogant .
a sports magazine ranked ballack third in a list of footballers most disliked by bundesliga players in a poll taken in 2002 with many stating his attitude behind their reasoning . coveted star despite " arroga n t " claims managers and coaches , however , loved the new ballack .
offers flew into the leverkusen office for " the little kaiser " - bayer 's general manager rainer calmund 's nick-name for ballack - from real madrid and barcelona in particular .
but the player who , with his straight-backed run and curly dark hair prompted comparisons with the young franz beckenbauer , was not ready to leave germany at that point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years , two bundesliga and german cup titles later and it may be a different story for michael ballack .
with manchester united looking for a long-term replacement for soon-to-be-departing midfield icon roy keane and real madrid in need of some steel in the center , ballack could be on his way out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how soon before ballack moves abroad ?
following a sterling confederations cup performance the rumor mill is hot with transfer talks concerning germany 's only real soccer star .

it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .
but has the union of michael ballack and bayern munich run its course ?
the answer could come within days . bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge claimed this week that the club would not extend contract talks with german international michael ballack with both parties set for a showdown meeting within the next 10 days . ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far refused to sign the lucrative four-year extension put forward by bayern . " we do not want this issue to drag on , " rummenigge told bild daily on thursday .
" michael ballack and his agent michael becker will meet with us in the middle of october and then he will inform us whether he accepts our offer or not . " ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united , inter milan and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client . " bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite missing the final , ballack 's preformances at the 2002 world cup helped his team make it .
the increasing speculation surrounding ballack and the much-publicized links to some of the world 's top clubs is testament to how coveted the germany midfielder has become .
ballack 's stock has been rising steadily since he almost single-handedly dragged his largely unimpressive team mates to the world cup final in 2002 . world cup seaso n brought ballack i n to focus but he first caught the eye of european suitors after his display in 2002 champions league campaign when he led bayer leverkusen to the final , which they narrowly lost 2-1 to real madrid . ballack 's performances that year signaled to the world that there was a precocious talent in the ascendancy in germany - he was just 25 - and many clubs ran the rule over him as a possible midfield general to drive the heart of their teams . however , while most hesitated with the check book , bayern did n't and got to him first .
ballack left the disappointment of an empty-handed season at leverkusen to sign for the munich giants for 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- after the world cup . it was a step-up that looked like it may never happen .
despite being a talented youngster at a handful of semi-professional east german clubs , it was only after his 1997 transfer from chemnitzer fc to kaiserslautern that ballack made it onto the big scene .

ballack began to cultivate the supreme self-confidence that has led to many calling him arrogant .
a sports magazine ranked ballack third in a list of footballers most disliked by bundesliga players in a poll taken in 2002 with many stating his attitude behind their reasoning . coveted star despite " arroga n t " claims managers and coaches , however , loved the new ballack .
offers flew into the leverkusen office for " the little kaiser " - bayer 's general manager rainer calmund 's nick-name for ballack - from real madrid and barcelona in particular .
but the player who , with his straight-backed run and curly dark hair prompted comparisons with the young franz beckenbauer , was not ready to leave germany at that point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years , two bundesliga and german cup titles later and it may be a different story for michael ballack .

" this is neither a farewell visit , nor my first visit has head of government , " he said after arriving for a two-day visit on friday .
" this is a visit of friendship . " but the two-day visit may indeed be schröder 's last trip to russia as german leader as talks between the chancellor and his christian democratic rival angela merkel , whose party narrowly won more seats in parliamentary elections last month , approach an endgame that points to schröder 's resignation . but the german leader said it was still an open question what shape a coalition government between his social democrats and merkel 's christian democrats would take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel are still fighting for the chancellorship " the chances are high that our two parties will form a coalition government , but what will it look like ?
that is yet to be discussed , " he said , adding that he was " convinced that a high level of continuity would be ensured , whatever changes there are in germany . " foreig n mi n ister schröder ? schröder 's trip to russia was partially responsible for delaying a final decision on germany 's next government .
a final installment of talks between social democrats and christian democrats is now scheduled for 8 p.m. local time on sunday .
but the leaders have stressed that a decision may not be officially announced until monday , because they first want to inform their parties about the result . a poll by german public television ard released on friday showed that germans were getting increasingly weary of the standoff , with 41 percent wanting schröder to step down and 39 percent saying both he and merkel should go . the top-selling bild newspaper on friday meanwhile raised the possibility that schröder would drop down to vice-chancellor and foreign minister in a merkel-led administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could schröder replace foreign minister joschka fischer ?

it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .
but has the union of michael ballack and bayern munich run its course ?
the answer could come within days . bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge claimed this week that the club would not extend contract talks with german international michael ballack with both parties set for a showdown meeting within the next 10 days . ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and has so far refused to sign the lucrative four-year extension put forward by bayern . " we do not want this issue to drag on , " rummenigge told bild daily on thursday .
" michael ballack and his agent michael becker will meet with us in the middle of october and then he will inform us whether he accepts our offer or not . " ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united , inter milan and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client . " bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite missing the final , ballack 's preformances at the 2002 world cup helped his team make it .
the increasing speculation surrounding ballack and the much-publicized links to some of the world 's top clubs is testament to how coveted the germany midfielder has become .
ballack 's stock has been rising steadily since he almost single-handedly dragged his largely unimpressive team mates to the world cup final in 2002 . world cup seaso n brought ballack i n to focus but he first caught the eye of european suitors after his display in 2002 champions league campaign when he led bayer leverkusen to the final , which they narrowly lost 2-1 to real madrid . ballack 's performances that year signaled to the world that there was a precocious talent in the ascendancy in germany - he was just 25 - and many clubs ran the rule over him as a possible midfield general to drive the heart of their teams . however , while most hesitated with the check book , bayern did n't and got to him first .
ballack left the disappointment of an empty-handed season at leverkusen to sign for the munich giants for 6.3 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- after the world cup . it was a step-up that looked like it may never happen .
despite being a talented youngster at a handful of semi-professional east german clubs , it was only after his 1997 transfer from chemnitzer fc to kaiserslautern that ballack made it onto the big scene .
and even then it was a bittersweet affair . shy east germa n labeled " too soft " for bu n desliga although kaiserslautern were crowned champions of germany a year after he joined , ballack had played just a minor role .
he clashed with coach otto rehhagel and was labeled too soft and inconsistent for the bundesliga and moved on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he then joined leverkusen for 3.6 million euros in 1999 , demanding the no.13 shirt on his arrival , once the property of local hero rudi völler , " to provoke a little . "
then he got injured . things got worse when he went on to score an own goal that cost leverkusen the bundesliga title - he cried on the pitch afterwards - and at euro 2000 was granted only 63 minutes of play for the national team . cha n ge of positio n a n d attitude but a transformation then occurred .
a change of position from a holding role to attacking midfield brought the best out of ballack , a player comfortable with arriving late as support for the strikers and one capable of scoring goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another took place in his head .
ballack began to cultivate the supreme self-confidence that has led to many calling him arrogant .
a sports magazine ranked ballack third in a list of footballers most disliked by bundesliga players in a poll taken in 2002 with many stating his attitude behind their reasoning . coveted star despite " arroga n t " claims managers and coaches , however , loved the new ballack .
offers flew into the leverkusen office for " the little kaiser " - bayer 's general manager rainer calmund 's nick-name for ballack - from real madrid and barcelona in particular .
but the player who , with his straight-backed run and curly dark hair prompted comparisons with the young franz beckenbauer , was not ready to leave germany at that point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three years , two bundesliga and german cup titles later and it may be a different story for michael ballack .
with manchester united looking for a long-term replacement for soon-to-be-departing midfield icon roy keane and real madrid in need of some steel in the center , ballack could be on his way out . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how soon before ballack moves abroad ?

the number of " charging orders " issued in county courts is running at 35,000 a year , three times what it was five years ago , bbc radio 4 's money box has learned .
advisers say the practice is becoming so common that the way loans and credit cards are being marketed should change to include mortgage-style warnings that your home may be at risk if you miss repayments .
they also say that if the number of charging orders being issued continues to rise then the government and regulators should be concerned .
having a charging order put on your home means that when the property is sold and the mortgage cleared , any money left over will go to pay the outstanding borrowing .
risk premium jane garret , from charity christians against poverty , said she believes it is becoming standard practice for some high street banks to issue charging orders , even when the debt is small .
she cited a case she dealt with where the borrower had begun to clear their loan : " six months after the instalments were started , the creditor goes for a charge , and when we enquire ' why have you changed from accepting this to going for a charge ? ' , -lsb- the bank -rsb- said it is our policy " .
citizens advice is another major organisation that is unhappy about this growing practice .
principal policy officer peter tutton said the banks stand to profit because , despite the security , they are still charging the higher interest rate of the unsecured debt .
" lenders are kind of getting it both ways , they are getting the risk premium off the borrower , but they are getting the security of the charge and that seems unfair . "
' last resort ' lloyds tsb , halifax bank of scotland , nationwide , northern rock , abbey , alliance and leicester , and marks and spencer money , all said they use charging orders to turn unsecured debt into borrowing secured against the home .
charging orders secure debt against your home most refused to say how many charging orders they issue each year , but nearly all said they only use them as a last resort .
malcolm hurlston of the consumer credit counselling service told the programme that if the practice increases further , the authorities should be concerned .
" if this trend were to continue at the current rate , " he said , " then there is no doubt about it , it 's something that ought to attract the attention of the department of trade and industry or the financial services authority . "
the financial regulator , the financial services authority , told the programme that as it does not regulate unsecured debt , it was a matter for the department of trade and industry -lrb- dti -rrb- .
the dti said it has spent £ 45m training debt advisers , and that other government departments are working to prevent so many debt cases coming to court .

in august , the government said it was asking the current 19 members of the board to continue into 2006 .
speaking on bbc radio ulster 's inside politics , mr robinson said his party would not let the demand drop .
" clearly we 've been pressing the government to make changes that they should have made and we were entitled to have back in 2003 , " mr robinson said .
" i hope that they will do that and i hope they 'll do it soon .
" i do n't think they can resist the strength of the argument nor have i seen any other political party being able to resist the strength of the argument either . "
the terms of office of all policing board members were due to expire this month .
the board is comprised of nine independent members and 10 drawn from the political parties .
the northern ireland policing board was established in november 2001 following recommendations in the patten report .

a chart-topper with culture club in the 1980s , he managed to reinvent himself as a solo artist , respected club dj and more recently as the writer of autobiographical musical taboo .
when george , real name george o 'dowd , first burst on to the mainstream stage in the 1980s , his androgyny , sense of dress and style marked him out in the british press .
' outrageous ' " after we went to number one everything changed , " he told the face magazine in 1998 .
" everybody recognised me .
before , people would laugh at me , as a figure of fascination , or amusement , or pity , and now fame gave me a licence to be outrageous . "
culture club 's high point came when their single karma chameleon topped the charts on both sides of the atlantic .
teenagers the world over were left to wonder what the lyrics meant , but loved the song nonetheless .
but there was more going on than boy george was prepared to admit .
he did not publicly say he was gay , but drug use resulted in him being exposed by the british tabloids as a heroin addict in 1987 and he had an on-off affair with drummer jon moss .
" i was an open , flamboyant , screaming homosexual , and then i 'd have to switch that off for public engagements .
i could n't say that jon and i loved each other , and that can only make life more twisted . "
tabloids the tabloids also broke the news that a visiting new york keyboard player , michael rudetski , died of a heroin overdose while staying at george 's london home .
he was arrested for possessing cannabis in july 1986 and the drug addiction and internal feuding led to the band falling apart .
the rows which led to the destruction of culture club were laid bare in george 's autobiography , take it like a man - especially regarding his relationship with moss .
george went into rehab and discovered buddhism and house music - which would later give him a lucrative , more stable career in the music business as a dj .
in 1987 , he had a solo hit with everything i own and kept releasing solo albums , but his success at home and in america did not match what he enjoyed with culture club .
but his career was revived in the second half of the 1990s as he began djing at the house clubs that he had began visiting in the late 1980s .
he soon established himself as a talented dj in his own right - rather than just a novelty act - and became one of the best-known names on the nightclub circuit .
when an offer came in to reform culture club in 1998 , he did not refuse .
the band toured the world once more , spending two-and-a-half years performing together .
in recent years he felt his way back into the media spotlight , appearing on television discussion shows arguing against section 28 - the law introduced by margaret thatcher 's government stopping local authorities " promoting " homosexuality - which was repealed in 2003 .
his also visited bosnia in 2001 to dj as part of a rebuilding process for the then war-torn country .
" it sounds a bit naïve in the uk to talk about dance music changing things , " he said at the time .
" but there 's something about it that really brings people together , that 's why we were so happy to give them the show . "
in 2002 a musical based on his rise to fame opened in london .
dealing honestly and sometimes painfully with his involvement in drugs and battles against homophobia it was a modest hit and transferred to broadway , new york , in 2004 where it was championed by rosie o 'donnell .
but the show closed less than three months after it opened after mainly negative reviews .

it warns tuberculosis costs the farming industry millions of pounds a year and must be eradicated .
in a letter to the government it cites " established links " between the prevalence of the disease within the cattle and badger populations .

rigorous testing its letter to animal welfare minister ben bradshaw said there was concern that waiting another year for the publication of results of culling trials would lead to increasing infection within the two populations .
this would " also increase the potential risk to human health " , it added .
the government had previously said it would only consider a badger cull if scientific evidence proved it would work .
following the bva 's letter , the badger trust said the government should tighten control measures within the cattle population , with more rigorous testing for the disease .
the national farmers ' union has said bovine tb poses a real threat to the beef and dairy industries and costs taxpayers almost £ 100m a year in compensation and testing .
farmers say in some parts of the country the disease is having as devastating an effect on agriculture as foot-and-mouth disease .

trials mr bradshaw announced in june the government was to launch a trial to test whether injecting badgers with a tb vaccine could prevent the spread of the disease in cattle .
the three-year trial , costing about £ 1.1m a year , will start next year in an area of high bovine tb prevalence in south-west england .
a further three-year project to create a version of the vaccine to be taken orally is due to start in november .
in february , more than 300 vets signed an open letter to the government which called for a " strategic cull " of badgers to control the spread of bovine tb .
they said badgers were mainly responsible for passing on the disease to cattle and they expressed " despair " with the government 's " inadequate approach " .

in the past nine days 63 vehicles have been clamped and officials are waiting for their owners to produce a valid tax disc and pay a release fee of £ 80 .
about 80 % of those clamped also have no insurance and 70 % of the vehicles ' occupants have criminal records .
officials say that a car that is not taxed is a " key indicator that something else is going on . "
john moore , dvla enforcement manager in the city , told bbc news that the team is also working with police using the automatic number plate recognition system .
he said : " we are looking to achieve accurate vehicle records because , nationally , there are one million vehicles -lrb- where -rrb- we do not know who the current keepers are .
" the police have made a huge number of arrests , not just in relation to the vehicles , but for drugs or violent crime for instance , so we need to target these vehicles .

in the past nine days 63 vehicles have been clamped and officials are waiting for their owners to produce a valid tax disc and pay a release fee of £ 80 .
about 80 % of those clamped also have no insurance and 70 % of the vehicles ' occupants have criminal records .
officials say that a car that is not taxed is a " key indicator that something else is going on . "
john moore , dvla enforcement manager in the city , told bbc news that the team is also working with police using the automatic number plate recognition system .
he said : " we are looking to achieve accurate vehicle records because , nationally , there are one million vehicles -lrb- where -rrb- we do not know who the current keepers are .
" the police have made a huge number of arrests , not just in relation to the vehicles , but for drugs or violent crime for instance , so we need to target these vehicles .
" we believe there is massive public support for what we are doing and we are targeting a small number of people . "

instead of birthday greetings , waiting reporters engaged mr adams in conversation about someone we thought might be an old friend - thomas " slab " murphy .
he had featured in the news that morning in relation to a major assets recovery agency operation in the greater manchester area .
the west belfast mp gave the impression he had not a clue who the county louth farmer might be .

the 57-year-old politician was not in the mood to expand , pointing out only that he believed the timing of the raids was not coincidental .

the first hurdle will be easily overcome , but the second is far more difficult , tied as it is to overall agreement on devolution .
